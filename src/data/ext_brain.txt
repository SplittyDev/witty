Now are you shut up?
Good.
Woo
loll
Hi Nullz
How are you?
good you aviv?
not good
why 
because I'm so sad
why are you sad
^
Hi Viperidae
HELLO
WHY ARE YOU SAD
Because I can't make anything good!
Descant is awesome
hell dude if you do the right marketing you can go far with descant
Descant is Aurora's thing
You helped
Aviv: I never finish anything
Also
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJioqMpfflo
yeah, that was my probelm
problem
I SWEAR TO GOD IF YOU LINK THAT TO YOUR PPTOSN FRIENDS.....
I would never!
Hahaha, it's all cool
and also what is going on with your window borders?
Good question
it looks like you have some crazy XP/Vista combo lol
^
I think I was trying to make it look like 7
That was XP
oh ok
on the other hand vista looks like 7 almost exactly..
vista is the oldest os I ever used
I wish I actually finished shit, I usually start a project; get somewhere on it; then move on to something else. 
lol 95 is the oldest I ever used
When I was a kid I had 95
I didn't know how to install XP
or ME
xD
my mom installed 7 on all of our computers
I don't really remember which my first OS was....
I didn't do anything on vista other than play a magic game
So yeah, I went from Win95 -> XP -> 7 -> Win8 Consumer Preview -> Fedora
lol
fedora
thats a os xD
lel
Fedoras.. hats.. == os
I went from ??/XP->XP->7 (starter)->windows 8->ubuntu+windows 8/8.1->window 8.1
xD
It's a GNU/Linux distro 
FEDORA IS A HAT NOT AN OS
Windows 8 was the final thing that pushed me away from Windows
silly Viperidae
Windows 8's awesome
XP > 7 Premium > Mac OS > 8 > Playing with ubunto linux on vm > 8.1 
I remember when I RMed C:\Windows
That was a glorious day
Windows 7 Starter is a truly horrible OS
win7 is god
Not starter edition...
but not for much longer because no d12 support
I'd totally use Windows 7 over windows 8
With an unchangeable acer/windows background 
evil!

This is perhaps even more cringe worthy 
Ready to see the most evil thing ever?
Sure!
https://youtu.be/sMpD1ED6lwY?t=34 my second fake os. My first fake os isn't on youtube anymore :/ 
I remember coming across this

WHAT IS THAT THING
http://i.imgur.com/IDnFwxw.png that is the evil
Another reason why I don't associate myself with the Minecraft community
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geL44QPxps0
whenever I try to play minecraft I now basically only play on a closed-off server...
but you see http://i.imgur.com/IDnFwxw.png is the most evil creation ever
I can't fucking stand listening to this guy

oh this is also evil http://i.imgur.com/CeS3wiB.jpg
Oh wow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dk7O4urcJNo
That was when I glued letters onto my keyboard to make it in the Dvorak layout
It's funny, because had no idea anyone still used this mod
But I gave up on that project
your mod is popular isn't it?
Apparently it is xD AtlanticCraft actually reviewed it a while ago, but it was really shitty when he made that review.
I'm just amazed that I found a whole bunch of new reviews
Viperidae: what do you think of http://discuss.flarum.org/?
I've seen this before, I like it. It's different though
yeah
I like it, but I don't like its developers AT ALL
they started off dissing mybb, phpbb, smf, etc and then they show you some pictures and ask for money
Lol
they had this crazy hosting idea which made no sense
and now they've given up on that and gone making it "open source"
Interesting
but then somebody forked it and now they're not posting stuff on their repo for a while xD
It hurt their lead developer's feelings lol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DP0kaN_eIA dat fps though
I don't think open source development is meant for him
Wow Nullz
I just noticed
MCE is perhaps the most popular thing I've ever developed
oh god it is
yep
Until Vulcan infects everyone that is...
and then everyone dies :o!
I am just amazed that Reagan uses Vulcan. It's funny that other people use it still to this day
Oh, Reagan...
Now I want to create minecraft maps shit
OH GOD FOUND ANOTHER SQUEAKER: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Izk_hi2dI
One of my videos once had 120k views
The channel ended up getting banned though
The video was a "wizard101 hack"
Well, this isn't technically my video; but this is perhaps the most popular thing that I've been a part of on Youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECFE7sTyb7k
What's funny is that all the videos on my channel relating to this mod have very little views
It was a video of a wizard101 "hack" and all the program did was view some of my residentevilfan500 videos(aka the minecraft one, which is why it has 5k views and 1 like and 1 dislike)
yeah
I deleted a lot of videos on my channel actually
which is funny because I still have over 100 uploaded videos
Remember that one video where it had a form designer and you could place buttons and stuff and you might of been able to code it?
Yeah
That was really cool, ether way, that was the first video I watched on your channel. Do you still have the video?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgbILMYFku8
I think it was related to this
Damn
I wish I still had alot of these programs
Just to look back at
yeah I thought that was the coolest shit ever but I remember one of your videos, and I think it was the same project but, it had a actual form designer
I think I made something like that, it was really useless though xD I think you could just drag a button, it wouldn't resize or anything like that. 
Wow
This is the most viewed video on my channel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0kXX_IgIFU
Hmm
I wonder what does with 2 videos
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h7-gVdOfn4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCC_-1gVE5Q
I guess nothing...?
I guess
Weird
splitty_ should probably try to fix that..
oh I just thought of a finished project of mine!
OH VIPERIDAE I JUST FOUND SOMETHING AMAZING ON MY CHANNEL
What?
also
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3DvVc2ZLjY
Anyone here play Elder Scrolls games?
no..
but really you need to watch that Viperidae
it's amazing
I got to level 1 on both morrowind and skyrim
"The ansf hacker"
Nullz: That is a shame
Skyrim is an awesome game xD
I actually rebuilt the entire continent of Tameriel in Minecraft though. 
I really don't understand this theory: http://i.imgur.com/xp6SgIB.png

I like how Midtown owned PPTOSN for like; a week or two
"it's obvious"
lol
Viperidae: which attacks?
Because the "Realistic" trollings were presentasia...
Infinite Spam
Oh
ok
lol
I knew nothing of that
lol it was pretty funny
I'll tell you after the break!
I feel sorry for the poor SOB who had to delete all those
NO
hmm
I wonder how long he'll be gone
So viperidae
Yeah boi
Lets talk about the illuminati. I know it isn't real, it takes a special type of person to believe that shit but, why is there so many references in media
+1 hes back
The answer: There isn't really, people make connections when there really aren't anny
*any
Vippy: You know what poor SOB had to clean up old PPTOSN?
Who/
*?
Me ahaha
Sorry about that!
Lol it's fine I learned something from it though
What?
How to disable images in IE!
lel
I don't think John's Codes turned off images in his browser
Maybe he liked them ;)
Yeah I agree with that other than one instance, the new spongebob movie. (https://youtu.be/fGdy8z7dCe4?t=210 and there in a triangle. I made this connection my self, and I think its to get people advertising it so more people would watch it)
Wow gj nullz!
shhh 
hes watching
Shhh.. This is totally not incriminating. http://pastie.org/10254171
no but really its weird but dont think I actually believe illuminati is real or some shit lol. It's for avertising and to get people to be like "You know spongebob is illuminati, go watch the move for your self! WAKE UP!"
http://pastebin.com/LsVPcNvL
Viperidae, I think we need to wake up *splashes burning water on our face* GOD IS REAL. JESUS IS OUR SAVIOR. WERE GOING TO HELL!!!! lel
This was a crazy documentary https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYv0uR1sD6A
Wow, I need to stop going through my dropbox xD
lol
I have so many pictures
You know when you see something from the past and it just like stabs you with painful memories?
YES
I just came across this screenshot in my dropbox... holy shit that hurt xD
Its happened to me before but for me it hurts to see things you'll never have and you know you won't no matter how hard you try.
Like what? Or is that personal. 
Eh general things but the 2 top is Rowan Blanchard and a dad/stepdad that cares about me
Lol about Rowan, never go for a girl based on her looks
Unless she's a fish 🐟
lol ^ +1 thats not the only reason lmfao
Or enjoy
Emily *
Whaaa
two avivs?
Yeah what?
Hi second Aviv which shouldn't be me
no here looks are not why I truly like her
I came across a screenshot of this
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/98653239/thefeelzbro.png
in my dropbox
The fucked up thing is this was said 4 hours before she broke up with me
Dont feel bad dude
tbh, and don't get mad at me but I dont think she truly wanted to kill her self
Oh over that, definitely not. 
She was being a manipulative little bitch to me. 
Clearly she didn't mean that, because she said that to me; then proceeded to break up with me. 
She is suicidal though, not because of that. 
Would you get mad at me if I called her a name?
No
I called her a stupid little whore the other day
The kind of weird messed up thing though is I still do love her; but I'll call her for what she is all day long
Shes obviously an attention whore
It's more complex than that
She's convinced that she has to fix in with society, and thinks that hanging out with people who aren't really your friends make you cool
I've been both truly suicidal before and looking for attention(I'm not longer like that thank the non existent god) and now I can easily tell if its true or not
Uhm
About the suicidal part
Ik shes been to hospitals
mental hospitals.
I can confirm that's legit. She's really fucked up; and she's on loads of medicines. She was at a rehab center after she tried to kill herself
She also used to cut herself
but viper, if she truly wanted to kill her self, why wouldn't of she just jumped off a building?
Obviously you know her more than me and I trust your decision but, usually, when people just openly talk about killing them selves or tell people they take meds and shit there doing it for attention. 
Because she couldn't? She suffers from clinical depression. I know her very well. When I first met her she seemed normal enough; but then a long time really good family friend of hers went out into a field, dosed himself in gasoline, and went ablaze ( http://wtkr.com/2013/11/24/person-found-on-fire-in-field-in-portsmouth/ ). 
Nullz: I think the whole attention thing is really insulting to the person in question. 
I wouldn't call it attention
And I think doing that is highly disrespectful to the person
It's a cry for help
I'm sorry viper.
Her case is very complex. I don't actually think she was at the point where she would have taken her own life, but she's messed up. 
I was there for her when she went through all of this. That's probably why I love her as much as I do. I really wish I could get another girlfriend, but now I only want serious relationships. I miss the one I had with her; but as I've discovered time and time again; no matter how hard I try I can't replicate the original relationship I had with her
And she's going downhill
She smokes, does drugs, ect. She did none of that when I was with her the first time
Yeah. Sorry about ^. That was just my experience.
There's no need to be sorry.
On a brighter note
I also found this in my dropbox
https://www.dropbox.com/s/pk5wycn52hz40pj/2015-03-23%2012.54.48.jpg?dl=0
Well I disrespected your judgment and I think I kinda sounded like an asshole saying "If you truly want to kill your self just jump off a building"
oimg lol
She is an attention whore (And by attention whore I mean someone who gets attention from guys/fake friends) but I know her depression is real. 
Also, the perhaps most fucked up thing is the fact that her "friends" don't give a shit about her, and she's too stupid to realize that
Or she doesn't care
You know is funny? How ugly she has gotten
Old her: https://www.dropbox.com/s/xua72whkrcfzfux/2015-01-14%2018.28.40.png?dl=0

Good night!

Do you see a similarity? https://www.dropbox.com/s/bhwi6ngydqcy1hk/2015-05-11%2009.28.31.jpg?dl=0

Someone just took my phone and was taking random pictures 
I don' think they were trying to take pictures of anything in particular. 
https://www.dropbox.com/s/e7tjqu15wntlz8h/2015-01-22%2014.04.59.jpg?dl=0
This is stupid...
lol you just reminded me, this one girl(and I'll get a link of what she looks like) she got my phone and took 80+ selfies with it. I was looking for it the whole day. My only question was how did she figure out the password and why the fuck didn't I tell on her.
https://scontent-dfw1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xta1/v/t1.0-9/11148659_1419813301668607_5937176249328526363_n.jpg?oh=cf4e462c7dcafab35dd930c32c0fdcbb&oe=55E9B896 (girl in the bottom with black hair)
and why is that stupid?
oh I'd fuck that
^ +1. Turns out, after talking to her and dating her for whole DAY she was raped
And, because I got those questions wrong because I wrote != and my teacher had no idea what that meant. She expected ≠
I like the girl on the right
I can see why
(She was raped)
and top but thats fucking way out my leage
That was probably fucked up
what I just said
lol nah its cool its funny
xD
Man! I want a girl!
I wonder how many people here have girl friends
Uhm
None
Afaik
i mean how many people here have partners
I think there are like three people here who aren't virgins
Splitty, Emily, and I are the only people who lost their virginity. Reagan got a blowjob, but that's it (For all we know though he had sex in Jesus camp). 
I am very proud that my finger isn't
And I've only kissed/fucked one girl so...
wait you've only kissed one girl?
Yes. 
kissed, like in your entire life
Yes, like kiss as in romantic kiss. 
Well whats a romantic kiss in your definition?
I mean kiss as in sexual
Like between a girlfriend/boyfriend
How old do you have to be in your definition to have one of these kisses
Uhm, I'd say 12+. I mean, basically I'm talking anything more than a peck. 
oh anything more than a peck. I've kissed NOONE! (by your definition)
Courtney's the only serious girlfriend I've ever had, if you haven't figured that out yet
I dated her like 4 times!
xD
Once for 9 months! Once for a week! Once for a month! Then once for 5 days!
Moral of the story: You can't rebuild a broken relationship
longest relationship I've had was less than 3 weeks, about a month and a half though if you keep adding to how long it lasted everytime you break up
So wyd?
Basically, nothing other than talking on IRC. I'm contemplating staying up all night, I'm also starting to dewitch java code for my mod
Nice.
I was thinking about using Iodine to script multiplayer gamemodes
That would be a good way to get a community for multiplayer but do note it might also decommunitize i guess your mod
Well, there's only so many gametypes you have to support to really make people happy.
true
btw I like Rowan for more than her beauty, I like her because she isn't scared to speak her mind she follows her dream(s) and she is really professional at doing so
Well, it's hard to really know a celeb. Just saying
Yeah I know. I like whats public 
I dont know whats private.
I'm talking to a girl right now
Shes talking about her boobs
Lol
Ithink I'm gonna have some interactive porn tonight instead of reg shit
i shoouldnt of sadi that
Cheeze! You guys discussed a lot here
Well it turns out it happened

hi 
your being dumb
Why are you being dumb 
I know 
wow that was from aviv 
Nullz: What happened?
Aviv I just masturbated while a girl was fingering herself and she was my friend. Were apparently dating now. Did i ruin the relationship?
oh
We skype called and apparently she found what I was saying cute and whatever soshe flashed her boobs and whenever I said something ufnny she did that then we started masturbating then I cummed 30 seconds later then it was all over.
lol we still talked but she went to sleep
TheBrokenKeeper: I replied

chatiness 1000
chattiness 1000
Hi 

hi 
How are you doing 
your intelligence is over 9001
TheBrokenKeeper, was that really zdimension?
bacon: He was 100% the real zdimension
My laptop is too hot...
And it shut itself down
No.
That what?
So... She's the first fake? Since when?
Hey... Don't copy me
Aviv, he broke it...
Yes, I know
Right, well, good for you mate
Yep, good battery life makes people
Awesome, we have a gamer here...
Witty, you are one crazy bitch
I am not
Right, well, good for you
do you like boobs?
Boobs are the two amazing bumps on a female's chest
That part is called the chest
Wow, hold on, don't get into that
bacon: Witty thinks that Aurora's parts are "open source"
Wow, hold on, Aurora's not your bitch
Soo... You don't believe that he's your bitch anymore?
Great...
. Lel
Hey Augment, TheBrokenKeeper
[mobile]splitty: Have you seen what said about Aurora?
Yes, Aurora
Yeah xD
He's weird
Wow... I am... I have no words, this bot is both fucking amazing and fucking weird
I've cleared his dictionary before I went to sleep
I see
In the end it seems to work best when it just listens to normal conversation. Feeding it books, Wikipedia articles and stuff didn't work very well
Yup
You need to fix the one word sentences
Yeah I actually tried to fix that yesterday but I fucked it up somehow
Well, try some more when you have time XD
Yeah ^^
So I plugged my macbook into my keyboard/mouse/monitor
Omg
Took me a while to figure out how to open applications without using the touchpad x)
wtf is ""
Lol
/
can I just put anything in here?
-_-
-does doing this stop it
nope
Witty is my bot. It uses continuous-time Markov processing to talk to people
It's not very good at it
So if I just spam swear words
It'll learn that?
Yeah
x)
1080p is so much better than 1440x900
We fed it Tom Sawyer and the King James Bible yesterday
It was a catastrophe
hook it up to a web crawler lol
It was like "the nigger great flood jerusalem"
lel
I need to learn how to use tools and shit
So I can turn this mess of cables into a dock :P
^^
DVI, audio, kb + m
and a charger lol
You should see the mess under my desk
i'll buy like a usb hub or something
to reduce the amount of cables
TheBrokenKeeper I am fucked
and so I can attach my optical drive
Good idea Ichiru
Vanessa will arrive here in like an hour
And Jannik doesn't wanna help me handle her
I am doomed
who is vanessa
and jannik
[mobile]splitty: Why?
Both friends of mine
does vanessa need.. handling?
Yesm
Soo... Why are you fucked?
so.. she's crazy?
or do you just piss her off :P
She pisses me off
ah
She is fucking annoying
Interesting
I have a friend like taht
And a basic Bitch
She doesn't shut up, and nobody cares
"I had a lot of homework"
xD
"OMG I HAD SO MUCH HOMEWORK AND I DID 17 HOURS OF DANCING AND I HAD WORK MY LIFE IS SO HARD"
"I didn't sleep a lot last night lol"
Well it looks like she will be here for like 12 hours
"YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW I HAVEN'T SLEPT IN 70 YEARS"
And for some reason she wants to make me drunk
Test
she's in my photography class ugh

Fun fact:
In spite of how allegedly good western intel programs are
WE STILL DON'T KNOW HOW RUSSIA GOT SUPERMANEUVERABILITY
Do you actually listen to what you say?
no, I read and write it mostly when I'm on irc
ser_berry, you know what I meant.
Fuchs, how can I do that?
tortib: to achieve what you want to do you'd need a bot with +o in your channel and, that's the tricky part, it'd need to be in the other channel, too
which I doubt the ops of that channel would like to see
yea
tortib: so there isn't really a way
lol what are you talking about
[17:50] <> see the one make me be here who had a friend lolwut
Banning people from a channel purely because they're in another channel seems rather petty, also
Fuchs: no, you could join the other channel from a different connection
Equinoxdawg, Nobody asked you.
tortib: Nobody needed to.
Fuchs: you shouldn't join it with the same connection because that would break the rule that nobody can be on both channels
b_jonas: that connection would have to talk to that bot though, and it's still highly unlikely the channel ops wanted that to happen
Fuchs: sure, the same bot connecting twice is the easiest for that
but yes, if the other channel kicks all your connections there then you can't do it anymore
Interesting read error.
b_jonas: and it's still, in my opinion, a bad idea and highly unlikely to work. And adding it as a feature raises some privacy and also performance concerns, so I don't see that happening for the limited amount of usecases it covers
hi
Hey nikx
What's up?
Fuchs: sure
nothing
wtf
Okay :D
Fuchs, how does it raise privacy concerns?
it doesnt
I know it doesn't
I want to see what his answer is
i have no idea what you are talking about actually
xP
tortib: you can get an easy, automatable way to check whether a user is in channel $x without being in that channel
currently this is not possible when the users have +i set, which is the default
Fuchs, how if the user is +i?
I told you i don't want to do it based on user
I want to do it based on channel
confirmed for markov bot
tortib: yes, but it still applies. You ban on "everybody who is in channel $x", so if user $y can't join your channel, you know that he is in channel $x
Markov bot?
lel
tortib: given you can set these bans while users are in a channel and check for matches, this is going to be quite abusable, especially as the +b list is rather dynamic and big enough for automating that
First you said it would raise privacy concerns and performance issues and haven't explained why it would.  Now you're saying it would be abuseable.
Yes, including an explanation of how to abuse it
the +b list being dynamic has nothing to do with automation
for it to be automated you would require a user in each channel
a bot
which is also magically the explanation of why it raises privacy issues, because it can be used to see if a user is in a specific channel without having to be in that channel, which is exactly what the +i umode makes impossible
And how would the operators/founders of that channel know if someone is joining their channel if they're automatically not allowed to join that channel?
no you don't, it is fully sufficient to have one in your channel which is able to set that type of ban you want to, then check if there is a match on a user. If yes, then the user is in the channel you set that ban based on.
They wouldn't have any information about it because the freenode server would automatically deny them from entering that channel
You can't check if the user is in that channel without a bot being in that other channel
We just went over this
tortib: not exactly true, especially due to how +b behaves when it matches a user actually in a channel, in addition with +z as well.
tortib: it can be abused, it would be quite bad performance-wise and there are no sane use cases for it, so I doubt it will be added, really
Fuchs, how would it affect performance?
would the owner of please remove it or make it stop talking, that'd be nice
And I don't see how it would be abused.
hello
There's an extban to do this, and we choose not to load it because of some of the reasons mentioned. End of conversation? (I hope)
how can i tell if i am connected with ssl? i'm not sure if it worked
roo, which reasons?
tortib: well, I explained it, whether you agree on it or not is unfortunately not something I can control. As for performance: it would have to check, if such a ban is set, whether users trying to join are in specific channels, which adds unneeded load.
roo
You shouldn't be able to connect at all to port 6697 without ssl

can you cloak me
I my mind serves me right
ccb12: you can whois yourself or check your modes
xzx12: no
ccb12: /whois yourself, and look for "is using a secure connection"
ccb12: you'll have a +Z if you are connected via SSL
ccb12: or the line roo mentioned
is says [ccb12] is using a secure connection
mquin but after 2 weeks, yes ?
Fuchs, roo, thanks
tortib: it's been years, but personally my main concerns are privacy, and no good reason for needing it
roo / mquin, if you could remove that silly bot, that would be lovely ♥
^
xzx12: provided you stop trying to waste our time between now and then
roo, I don't see how it would cause privacy concerns?
roo, can you explain it to me like I'm 5 years old?
tortib: It'd be ineffective as the majority of our users are +i. Were it modified to actually work as intended, it could be used leak channel membership information, which we don't see as being acceptbale
