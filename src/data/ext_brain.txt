PREFACE.
In the literature of all countries there will be found a certain number
of works treating especially of love. Everywhere the subject is dealt
with differently, and from various points of view. In the present
publication it is proposed to give a complete translation of what is
considered the standard work on love in Sanscrit literature, and which
is called the 'Vatsyayana Kama Sutra,' or Aphorisms on Love, by
Vatsyayana.
While the introduction will bear with the evidence concerning the date
of the writing, and the commentaries written upon it, the chapters
following the introduction will give a translation of the work itself.
It is, however, advisable to furnish here a brief analysis of works of
the same nature, prepared by authors who lived and wrote years after
Vatsya had passed away, but who still considered him as a great
authority, and always quoted him as the chief guide to Hindoo erotic
literature.
Besides the treatise of Vatsyayana the following works on the same
subject are procurable in India:--
1. The Ratirahasya, or secrets of love.
2. The Panchasakya, or the five arrows.
3. The Smara Pradipa, or the light of love.
4. The Ratimanjari, or the garland of love.
5. The Rasmanjari, or the sprout of love.
6. The Anunga Runga, or the stage of love; also called
Kamaledhiplava, or a boat in the ocean of love.
The author of the 'Secrets of Love' (No. 1) was a poet named Kukkoka. He
composed his work to please one Venudutta, who was perhaps a king. When
writing his own name at the end of each chapter he calls himself Siddha
patiya pandita, _i.e._, an ingenious man among learned men. The work
was translated into Hindi years ago, and in this the author's name was
written as Koka. And as the same name crept into all the translations
into other languages in India, the book became generally known, and the
subject was popularly called Koka Shastra, or doctrines of Koka, which
is identical with the Kama Shastra, or doctrines of love, and the words
Koka Shastra and Kama Shastra are used indiscriminately.
The work contains nearly eight hundred verses, and is divided into ten
chapters, which are called Pachivedas. Some of the things treated of in
this work are not to be found in the Vatsyayana, such as the four
classes of women, viz., the Padmini, Chitrini, Shankini and Hastini, as
also the enumeration of the days and hours on which the women of the
different classes become subject to love. The author adds that he wrote
these things from the opinions of Gonikaputra and Nandikeshwara, both of
whom are mentioned by Vatsyayana, but their works are not now extant. It
is difficult to give any approximate idea as to the year in which the
work was composed. It is only to be presumed that it was written after
that of Vatsyayana, and previous to the other works on this subject that
are still extant. Vatsyayana gives the names of ten authors on the
subject, all of whose works he had consulted, but none of which are
extant, and does not mention this one. This would tend to show that
Kukkoka wrote after Vatsya, otherwise Vatsya would assuredly have
mentioned him as an author in this branch of literature along with the
others.
The author of the 'Five Arrows' (No. 2 in the list) was one Jyotirisha.
He is called the chief ornament of poets, the treasure of the sixty-four
arts, and the best teacher of the rules of music. He says that he
composed the work after reflecting on the aphorisms of love as revealed
by the gods, and studying the opinions of Gonikaputra, Muladeva,
Babhravya, Ramtideva, Nundikeshwara and Kshemandra. It is impossible to
say whether he had perused all the works of these authors, or had only
heard about them; anyhow, none of them appear to be in existence now.
This work contains nearly six hundred verses, and is divided into five
chapters, called Sayakas or Arrows.
The author of the 'Light of Love' (No. 3) was the poet Gunakara, the son
of Vechapati. The work contains four hundred verses, and gives only a
short account of the doctrines of love, dealing more with other
matters.
'The Garland of Love' (No. 4) is the work of the famous poet Jayadeva,
who said about himself that he is a writer on all subjects. This
treatise is, however, very short, containing only one hundred and
twenty-five verses.
The author of the 'Sprout of Love' (No. 5) was a poet called Bhanudatta.
It appears from the last verse of the manuscript that he was a resident
of the province of Tirhoot, the son of a Brahman named Ganeshwar, who
was also a poet. The work, written in Sanscrit, gives the descriptions
of different classes of men and women, their classes being made out from
their age, description, conduct, etc. It contains three chapters, and
its date is not known, and cannot be ascertained.
'The Stage of Love' (No. 6) was composed by the poet Kullianmull, for
the amusement of Ladkhan, the son of Ahmed Lodi, the same Ladkhan being
in some places spoken of as Ladana Mull, and in others as Ladanaballa.
He is supposed to have been a relation or connection of the house of
Lodi, which reigned in Hindostan from A.D. 1450-1526. The work would,
therefore, have been written in the fifteenth or sixteenth century. It
contains ten chapters, and has been translated into English, but only
six copies were printed for private circulation. This is supposed to be
the latest of the Sanscrit works on the subject, and the ideas in it
were evidently taken from previous writings of the same nature.
The contents of these works are in themselves a literary curiosity.
There are to be found both in Sanscrit poetry and in the Sanscrit drama
a certain amount of poetical sentiment and romance, which have, in every
country and in every language, thrown an immortal halo round the
subject. But here it is treated in a plain, simple, matter of fact sort
of way. Men and women are divided into classes and divisions in the same
way that Buffon and other writers on natural history have classified and
divided the animal world. As Venus was represented by the Greeks to
stand forth as the type of the beauty of woman, so the Hindoos describe
the Padmini or Lotus woman as the type of most perfect feminine
excellence, as follows:
She in whom the following signs and symptoms appear is called a Padmini.
Her face is pleasing as the full moon; her body, well clothed with
flesh, is soft as the Shiras or mustard flower, her skin is fine,
tender and fair as the yellow lotus, never dark coloured. Her eyes are
bright and beautiful as the orbs of the fawn, well cut, and with reddish
corners. Her bosom is hard, full and high; she has a good neck; her nose
is straight and lovely, and three folds or wrinkles cross her
middle--about the umbilical region. Her yoni resembles the opening lotus
bud, and her love seed (Kama salila) is perfumed like the lily that has
newly burst. She walks with swan-like gait, and her voice is low and
musical as the note of the Kokila bird, she delights in white raiments,
in fine jewels, and in rich dresses. She eats little, sleeps lightly,
and being as respectful and religious as she is clever and courteous,
she is ever anxious to worship the gods, and to enjoy the conversation
of Brahmans. Such, then, is the Padmini or Lotus woman.
Detailed descriptions then follow of the Chitrini or Art woman; the
Shankhini or Conch woman, and the Hastini or Elephant woman, their days
of enjoyment, their various seats of passion, the manner in which they
should be manipulated and treated in sexual intercourse, along with the
characteristics of the men and women of the various countries in
Hindostan. The details are so numerous, and the subjects so seriously
dealt with, and at such length, that neither time nor space will permit
of their being given here.
One work in the English language is somewhat similar to these works of
the Hindoos. It is called 'Kalogynomia: or the Laws of Female Beauty,'
being the elementary principles of that science, by T. Bell, M.D., with
twenty-four plates, and printed in London in 1821. It treats of Beauty,
of Love, of Sexual Intercourse, of the Laws regulating that Intercourse,
of Monogamy and Polygamy, of Prostitution, of Infidelity, ending with a
_catalogue raisonn√©e_ of the defects of female beauty.
Other works in English also enter into great details of private and
domestic life. 'The Elements of Social Science, or Physical, Sexual and
Natural Religion,' by a Doctor of Medicine, London, 1880, and 'Every
Woman's Book,' by Dr. Waters, 1826. To persons interested in the above
subjects these works will be found to contain such details as have been
seldom before published, and which ought to be thoroughly understood by
all philanthropists and benefactors of society.
After a perusal of the Hindoo work, and of the English books above
mentioned, the reader will understand the subject, at all events from a
materialistic, realistic and practical point of view. If all science is
founded more or less on a stratum of facts, there can be no harm in
making known to mankind generally certain matters intimately connected
with their private, domestic, and social life.
Alas! complete ignorance of them has unfortunately wrecked many a man
and many a woman, while a little knowledge of a subject generally
ignored by the masses would have enabled numbers of people to have
understood many things which they believed to be quite incomprehensible,
or which were not thought worthy of their consideration.
INTRODUCTION.
It may be interesting to some persons to learn how it came about that
Vatsyayana was first brought to light and translated into the English
language. It happened thus. While translating with the pundits the
'Anunga runga, or the stage of love,' reference was frequently found to
be made to one Vatsya. The sage Vatsya was of this opinion, or of that
opinion. The sage Vatsya said this, and so on. Naturally questions were
asked who the sage was, and the pundits replied that Vatsya was the
author of the standard work on love in Sanscrit literature, that no
Sanscrit library was complete without his work, and that it was most
difficult now to obtain in its entire state. The copy of the manuscript
obtained in Bombay was defective, and so the pundits wrote to Benares,
Calcutta and Jeypoor for copies of the manuscript from Sanscrit
libraries in those places. Copies having been obtained, they were then
compared with each other, and with the aid of a Commentary called
'Jayamangla' a revised copy of the entire manuscript was prepared, and
from this copy the English translation was made. The following is the
certificate of the chief pundit:--
The accompanying manuscript is corrected by me after comparing four
different copies of the work. I had the assistance of a Commentary
called 'Jayamangla' for correcting the portion in the first five parts,
but found great difficulty in correcting the remaining portion, because,
with the exception of one copy thereof which was tolerably correct, all
the other copies I had were far too incorrect. However, I took that
portion as correct in which the majority of the copies agreed with each
other.
The 'Aphorisms on Love,' by Vatsyayana, contains about one thousand two
hundred and fifty slokas or verses, and are divided into parts, parts
into chapters, and chapters into paragraphs. The whole consists of
seven parts, thirty-six chapters, and sixty-four paragraphs. Hardly
anything is known about the author. His real name is supposed to be
Mallinaga or Mrillana, Vatsyayana being his family name. At the close of
the work this is what he writes about himself:
After reading and considering the works of Babhravya and other ancient
authors, and thinking over the meaning of the rules given by them, this
treatise was composed, according to the precepts of the Holy Writ, for
the benefit of the world, by Vatsyayana, while leading the life of a
religious student at Benares, and wholly engaged in the contemplation of
the Deity. This work is not to be used merely as an instrument for
satisfying our desires. A person acquainted with the true principles of
this science, who preserves his Dharma (virtue or religious merit), his
Artha (worldly wealth) and his Kama (pleasure or sensual gratification),
and who has regard to the customs of the people, is sure to obtain the
mastery over his senses. In short, an intelligent and knowing person,
attending to Dharma and Artha and also to Kama, without becoming the
slave of his passions, will obtain success in everything that he may
do.
It is impossible to fix the exact date either of the life of Vatsyayana
or of his work. It is supposed that he must have lived between the first
and the sixth centuries of the Christian era, on the following
grounds:--He mentions that Satkarni Srtvahan, a king of Kuntal, killed
Malayevati his wife with an instrument called kartari by striking her in
the passion of love, and Vatsya quotes this case to warn people of the
danger arising from some old customs of striking women when under the
influence of this passion. Now this king of Kuntal is believed to have
lived and reigned during the first century A.C., and consequently Vatsya
must have lived after him. On the other hand, Virahamihira, in the
eighteenth chapter of his 'Brihatsanhita,' treats of the science of
love, and appears to have borrowed largely from Vatsyayana on the
subject. Now Virahamihira is said to have lived during the sixth century
A.D., and as Vatsya must have written his works previously, therefore
not earlier than the first century, A.C., and not later than the sixth
century A.D., must be considered as the approximate date of his
existence.
On the text of the 'Aphorisms on Love,' by Vatsyayana, only two
commentaries have been found. One called 'Jayamangla' or 'Sutrabashya,'
and the other 'Sutra vritti.' The date of the 'Jayamangla' is fixed
between the tenth and thirteenth centuries A.D., because while treating
of the sixty-four arts an example is taken from the 'K√°vyaprak√°sha,'
which was written about the tenth century A.D. Again, the copy of the
commentary procured was evidently a transcript of a manuscript which
once had a place in the library of a Chaulukyan king named Vishaladeva,
a fact elicited from the following sentence at the end of it:--
Here ends the part relating to the art of love in the commentary on the
'Vatsyayana Kama Sutra,' a copy from the library of the king of kings,
Vishaladeva, who was a powerful hero, as it were a second Arjuna, and
head jewel of the Chaulukya family.
Now it is well known that this king ruled in Guzerat from 1244 to 1262
A.D., and founded a city called Visalnagur. The date, therefore, of the
commentary is taken to be not earlier than the tenth and not later than
the thirteenth century. The author of it is supposed to be one
Yashodhara, the name given him by his preceptor being Indrapada. He
seems to have written it during the time of affliction caused by his
separation from a clever and shrewd woman, at least that is what he
himself says at the end of each chapter. It is presumed that he called
his work after the name of his absent mistress, or the word may have
some connection with the meaning of her name.
This commentary was most useful in explaining the true meaning of
Vatsyayana, for the commentator appears to have had a considerable
knowledge of the times of the older author, and gives in some places
very minute information. This cannot be said of the other commentary,
called Sutra vritti, which was written about A.D., by Narsing Shastri,
a pupil of a Sarveshwar Shastri; the latter was a descendant of Bhaskur,
and so also was our author, for at the conclusion of every part he calls
himself Bhaskur Narsing Shastra. He was induced to write the work by
order of the learned Raja Vrijalala, while he was residing in Benares,
but as to the merits of this commentary it does not deserve much
commendation. In many cases the writer does not appear to have
understood the meaning of the original author, and has changed the text
in many places to fit in with his own explanations.
A complete translation of the original work now follows. It has been
prepared in complete accordance with the text of the manuscript, and is
given, without further comments, as made from it.

THE VATSYAYANA SUTRA.
INTRODUCTORY PREFACE.
SALUTATION TO DHARMA, ARTHA AND KAMA.
In the beginning, the Lord of Beings created men and women, and in the
form of commandments in one hundred thousand chapters laid down rules
for regulating their existence with regard to Dharma,[1] Artha,[2] and
Kama.[3] Some of these commandments, namely those which treated of
Dharma, were separately written by Swayambhu Manu; those that related to
Artha were compiled by Brihaspati; and those that referred to Kama were
expounded by Nandi, the follower of Mahadeva, in one thousand chapters.
Now these 'Kama Sutra' (Aphorisms on Love), written by Nandi in one
thousand chapters, were reproduced by Shvetaketu, the son of Uddvalaka,
in an abbreviated form in five hundred chapters, and this work was again
similarly reproduced in an abridged form, in one hundred and fifty
chapters, by Babhravya, an inhabitant of the Punchala (South of Delhi)
country. These one hundred and fifty chapters were then put together
under seven heads or parts named severally--
1st. Sadharana (general topics).
2nd. Samprayogika (embraces, etc.).
3rd. Kanya Samprayuktaka (union of males and females).
4th. Bharyadhikarika (on one's own wife).
5th. Paradika (on the wives of other people).
6th. Vaisika (on courtesans).
7th. Aupamishadika (on the arts of seduction, tonic medicines, etc.).
The sixth part of this last work was separately expounded by Dattaka at
the request of the public women of Pataliputra (Patna), and in the same
way Charayana explained the first part of it. The remaining parts, viz.,
the second, third, fourth, fifth, and seventh were each separately
expounded by--
Suvarnanabha (second part).
Ghotakamukha (third part).
Gonardiya (fourth part).
Gonikaputra (fifth part).
Kuchumara (seventh part), respectively.
Thus the work being written in parts by different authors was almost
unobtainable, and as the parts which were expounded by Dattaka and the
others treated only of the particular branches of the subject to which
each part related, and moreover as the original work of Babhravya was
difficult to be mastered on account of its length, Vatsyayana,
therefore, composed his work in a small volume as an abstract of the
whole of the works of the above-named authors.

CHAPTER II.
ON THE ACQUISITION OF DHARMA, ARTHA AND KAMA.
Man, the period of whose life is one hundred years, should practise
Dharma, Artha, and Kama at different times and in such a manner that
they may harmonize together and not clash in any way. He should acquire
learning in his childhood, in his youth and middle age he should attend
to Artha and Kama, and in his old age he should perform Dharma, and thus
seek to gain Moksha, _i.e._, release from further transmigration. Or, on
account of the uncertainty of life, he may practise them at times when
they are enjoined to be practised. But one thing is to be noted, he
should lead the life of a religious student until he finishes his
education.
_Dharma_ is obedience to the command of the Shastra or Holy Writ of the
Hindoos to do certain things, such as the performance of sacrifices,
which are not generally done because they do not belong to this world,
and produce no visible effect; and not to do other things, such as
eating meat, which is often done because it belongs to this world, and
has visible effects.
Dharma should be learnt from the Shruti (Holy Writ), and from those
conversant with it.
_Artha_ is the acquisition of arts, land, gold, cattle, wealth,
equipages and friends. It is, further, the protection of what is
acquired, and the increase of what is protected.
Artha should be learnt from the king's officers, and from merchants who
may be versed in the ways of commerce.
_Kama_ is the enjoyment of appropriate objects by the five senses of
hearing, feeling, seeing, tasting, and smelling, assisted by the mind
together with the soul. The ingredient in this is a peculiar contact
between the organ of sense and its object, and the consciousness of
pleasure which arises from that contact is called Kama.
Kama is to be learnt from the Kama Sutra (aphorisms on love) and from
the practice of citizens.
When all the three, viz., Dharma, Artha, and Kama come together, the
former is better than the one which follows it, _i.e._, Dharma is better
than Artha, and Artha is better than Kama. But Artha should be always
first practised by the king, for the livelihood of men is to be obtained
from it only. Again, Kama being the occupation of public women, they
should prefer it to the other two, and these are exceptions to the
general rule.
_Objection 1._
Some learned men say that as Dharma is connected with things not
belonging to this world, it is appropriately treated of in a book; and
so also is Artha, because it is practised only by the application of
proper means, and a knowledge of those means can only be obtained by
study and from books. But Kama being a thing which is practised even by
the brute creation, and which is to be found everywhere, does not want
any work on the subject.
_Answer._
This is not so. Sexual intercourse being a thing dependent on man and
woman requires the application of proper means by them, and those means
are to be learnt from the Kama Shastra. The non-application of proper
means, which we see in the brute creation, is caused by their being
unrestrained, and by the females among them only being fit for sexual
intercourse at certain seasons and no more, and by their intercourse not
being preceded by thought of any kind.
_Objection 2._
The Lokayatikas[4] say:--Religious ordinances should not be observed,
for they bear a future fruit, and at the same time it is also doubtful
whether they will bear any fruit at all. What foolish person will give
away that which is in his own hands into the hands of another?
Moreover, it is better to have a pigeon to-day than a peacock to-morrow;
and a copper coin which we have the certainty of obtaining, is better
than a gold coin, the possession of which is doubtful.
_Answer._
It is not so. 1st. Holy Writ, which ordains the practice of Dharma, does
not admit of a doubt.
2nd. Sacrifices such as those made for the destruction of enemies, or
for the fall of rain, are seen to bear fruit.
3rd. The sun, moon, stars, planets and other heavenly bodies appear to
work intentionally for the good of the world.
4th. The existence of this world is effected by the observance of the
rules respecting the four classes[5] of men and their four stages of
life.
5th. We see that seed is thrown into the ground with the hope of future
crops.
Vatsyayana is therefore of opinion that the ordinances of religion must
be obeyed.
_Objection 3._
Those who believe that destiny is the prime mover of all things say:--We
should not exert ourselves to acquire wealth, for sometimes it is not
acquired although we strive to get it, while at other times it comes to
us of itself without any exertion on our part. Everything is therefore
in the power of destiny, who is the lord of gain and loss, of success
and defeat, of pleasure and pain. Thus we see the Bali[6] was raised to
the throne of Indra by destiny, and was also put down by the same power,
and it is destiny only that can re-instate him.
_Answer._
It is not right to say so. As the acquisition of every object
pre-supposes at all events some exertion on the part of man, the
application of proper means may be said to be the cause of gaining all
our ends, and this application of proper means being thus necessary
(even where a thing is destined to happen), it follows that a person who
does nothing will enjoy no happiness.
_Objection 4._
Those who are inclined to think that Artha is the chief object to be
obtained argue thus. Pleasures should not be sought for, because they
are obstacles to the practice of Dharma and Artha, which are both
superior to them, and are also disliked by meritorious persons.
Pleasures also bring a man into distress, and into contact with low
persons; they cause him to commit unrighteous deeds, and produce
impurity in him; they make him regardless of the future, and encourage
carelessness and levity. And lastly, they cause him to be disbelieved by
all, received by none, and despised by everybody, including himself. It
is notorious, moreover, that many men who have given themselves up to
pleasure alone, have been ruined along with their families and
relations. Thus, King Dandakya,[7] of the Bhoja dynasty, carried off a
Brahman's daughter with evil intent, and was eventually ruined and lost
his kingdom. Indra, too, having violated the chastity of Ahalya,[8] was
made to suffer for it. In a like manner the mighty Kichaka,[9] who tried
to seduce Draupadi, and Ravana,[10] who attempted to gain over Sita, were
punished for their crimes. These and many others fell by reason of their
pleasures.
_Answer._
This objection cannot be sustained, for pleasures, being as necessary
for the existence and well being of the body as food, are consequently
equally required. They are, moreover, the results of Dharma and Artha.
Pleasures are, therefore, to be followed with moderation and caution. No
one refrains from cooking food because there are beggars to ask for it,
or from sowing seed because there are deer to destroy the corn when it
is grown up.
Thus a man practising Dharma, Artha and Kama enjoys happiness both in
this world and in the world to come. The good perform those actions in
which there is no fear as to what is to result from them in the next
world, and in which there is no danger to their welfare. Any action
which conduces to the practice of Dharma, Artha and Kama together, or of
any two, or even one of them, should be performed, but an action which
conduces to the practice of one of them at the expense of the remaining
two should not be performed.

should be referred to.]
[Footnote 10: The story of Ravana is told in the Ramayana, which with the
Mahabarata form the two great epic poems of the Hindoos; the latter was
written by Vyasa, and the former by Valmiki.]
CHAPTER III.
ON THE ARTS AND SCIENCES TO BE STUDIED.
Man should study the Kama Sutra and the arts and sciences subordinate
thereto, in addition to the study of the arts and sciences contained in
Dharma and Artha. Even young maids should study this Kama Sutra along
with its arts and sciences before marriage, and after it they should
continue to do so with the consent of their husbands.
Here some learned men object, and say that females, not being allowed to
study any science, should not study the Kama Sutra.
But Vatsyayana is of opinion that this objection does not hold good, for
women already know the practice of Kama Sutra, and that practice is
derived from the Kama Shastra, or the science of Kama itself. Moreover,
it is not only in this but in many other cases that though the practice
of a science is known to all, only a few persons are acquainted with the
rules and laws on which the science is based. Thus the Yadnikas or
sacrificers, though ignorant of grammar, make use of appropriate words
when addressing the different Deities, and do not know how these words
are framed. Again, persons do the duties required of them on auspicious
days, which are fixed by astrology, though they are not acquainted with
the science of astrology. In a like manner riders of horses and
elephants train these animals without knowing the science of training
animals, but from practice only. And similarly the people of the most
distant provinces obey the laws of the kingdom from practice, and
because there is a king over them, and without further reason.[11] And
from experience we find that some women, such as daughters of princes
and their ministers, and public women, are actually versed in the Kama
Shastra.
A female, therefore, should learn the Kama Shastra, or at least a part
of it, by studying its practice from some confidential friend. She
should study alone in private the sixty-four practices that form a part
of the Kama Shastra. Her teacher should be one of the following persons,
viz., the daughter of a nurse brought up with her and already
married,[12] or a female friend who can be trusted in everything, or the
sister of her mother (_i.e._, her aunt), or an old female servant, or a
female beggar who may have formerly lived in the family, or her own
sister, who can always be trusted.
The following are the arts to be studied, together with the Kama
Sutra:--
1. Singing.
2. Playing on musical instruments.
3. Dancing.
4. Union of dancing, singing, and playing instrumental music.

11. The art of making beds, and spreading out carpets and cushions for
reclining.

26. Making parrots, flowers, tufts, tassels, bunches, bosses, knobs,
&c., out of yarn or thread.
27. Solution of riddles, enigmas, covert speeches, verbal puzzles and
enigmatical questions.
28. A game, which consisted in repeating verses, and as one person
finished, another person had to commence at once, repeating another
verse, beginning with the same letter with which the last speaker's
verse ended, whoever failed to repeat was considered to have lost, and
to be subject to pay a forfeit or stake of some kind.
29. The art of mimicry or imitation.
30. Reading, including chanting and intoning.
31. Study of sentences difficult to pronounce. It is played as a game
chiefly by women and children, and consists of a difficult sentence
being given, and when repeated quickly, the words are often transposed
or badly pronounced.
32. Practice with sword, single stick, quarter staff, and bow and arrow.
33. Drawing inferences, reasoning or inferring.
34. Carpentry, or the work of a carpenter.
35. Architecture, or the art of building.
36. Knowledge about gold and silver coins, and jewels and gems.
37. Chemistry and mineralogy.
38. Colouring jewels, gems and beads.
39. Knowledge of mines and quarries.
40. Gardening; knowledge of treating the diseases of trees and plants,
of nourishing them, and determining their ages.
41. Art of cock fighting, quail fighting and ram fighting.
42. Art of teaching parrots and starlings to speak.
43. Art of applying perfumed ointments to the body, and of dressing the
hair with unguents and perfumes and braiding it.
44. The art of understanding writing in cypher, and the writing of words
in a peculiar way.
45. The art of speaking by changing the forms of words. It is of various
kinds. Some speak by changing the beginning and end of words, others by
adding unnecessary letters between every syllable of a word, and so on.
46. Knowledge of language and of the vernacular dialects.
47. Art of making flower carriages.
48. Art of framing mystical diagrams, of addressing spells and charms,
and binding armlets.
49. Mental exercises, such as completing stanzas or verses on receiving
a part of them; or supplying one, two or three lines when the remaining
lines are given indiscriminately from different verses, so as to make
the whole an entire verse with regard to its meaning; or arranging the
words of a verse written irregularly by separating the vowels from the
consonants, or leaving them out altogether; or putting into verse or
prose sentences represented by signs or symbols. There are many other
such exercises.
50. Composing poems.
51. Knowledge of dictionaries and vocabularies.
52. Knowledge of ways of changing and disguising the appearance of
persons.
53. Knowledge of the art of changing the appearance of things, such as
making cotton to appear as silk, coarse and common things to appear as
fine and good.
54. Various ways of gambling.
55. Art of obtaining possession of the property of others by means of
muntras or incantations.
56. Skill in youthful sports.
57. Knowledge of the rules of society, and of how to pay respects and
compliments to others.
58. Knowledge of the art of war, of arms, of armies, &c.

61. Knowledge of scanning or constructing verses.
62. Arithmetical recreations.
63. Making artificial flowers.
64. Making figures and images in clay.
A public woman, endowed with a good disposition, beauty and other
winning qualities, and also versed in the above arts, obtains the name
of a Ganika, or public woman of high quality, and receives a seat of
honour in an assemblage of men. She is, moreover, always respected by
the king, and praised by learned men, and her favour being sought for by
all, she becomes an object of universal regard. The daughter of a king
too, as well as the daughter of a minister, being learned in the above
arts, can make their husbands favourable to them, even though these may
have thousands of other wives besides themselves. And in the same
manner, if a wife becomes separated from her husband, and falls into
distress, she can support herself easily, even in a foreign country, by
means of her knowledge of these arts. Even the bare knowledge of them
gives attractiveness to a woman, though the practice of them may be only
possible or otherwise according to the circumstances of each case. A man
who is versed in these arts, who is loquacious and acquainted with the
arts of gallantry, gains very soon the hearts of women, even though he
is only acquainted with them for a short time.

CHAPTER IV.
THE LIFE OF A CITIZEN.[13]
Having thus acquired learning, a man, with the wealth that he may have
gained by gift, conquest, purchase, deposit,[14] or inheritance from his
ancestors, should become a householder, and pass the life of a citizen.
He should take a house in a city, or large village, or in the vicinity
of good men, or in a place which is the resort of many persons. This
abode should be situated near some water, and divided into different
compartments for different purposes. It should be surrounded by a
garden, and also contain two rooms, an outer and an inner one. The inner
room should be occupied by the females, while the outer room, balmy with
rich perfumes, should contain a bed, soft, agreeable to the sight
covered with a clean white cloth, low in the middle part, having
garlands and bunches of flowers[15] upon it, and a canopy above it, and
two pillows, one at the top, another at the bottom. There should be also
a sort of couch besides, and at the head of this a sort of stool, on
which should be placed the fragrant ointments for the night, as well as
flowers, pots containing collyrium and other fragrant substances, things
used for perfuming the mouth, and the bark of the common citron tree.
Near the couch, on the ground, there should be a pot for spitting, a box
containing ornaments, and also a lute hanging from a peg made of the
tooth of an elephant, a board for drawing, a pot containing perfume,
some books, and some garlands of the yellow amaranth flowers. Not far
from the couch, and on the ground, there should be a round seat, a toy
cart, and a board for playing with dice; outside the outer room
there should be cages of birds,[16] and a separate place for spinning,
carving, and such like diversions. In the garden there should be a
whirling swing and a common swing, as also a bower of creepers covered
with flowers, in which a raised parterre should be made for sitting.
Now the householder having got up in the morning and performed his
necessary duties,[17] should wash his teeth, apply a limited quantity of
ointments and perfumes to his body, put some ornaments on his person and
collyrium on his eyelids and below his eyes, colour his lips with
alacktaka,[18] and look at himself in the glass. Having then eaten betel
leaves, with other things that give fragrance to the mouth, he should
perform his usual business. He should bathe daily, anoint his body with
oil every other day, apply a lathering[19] substance to his body every
three days, get his head (including face) shaved every four days, and
the other parts of his body every five or ten days.[20] All these things
should be done without fail, and the sweat of the armpits should also be
removed. Meals should be taken in the forenoon, in the afternoon, and
again at night, according to Charayana. After breakfast, parrots and
other birds should be taught to speak, and the fighting of cocks,
quails, and rams should follow. A limited time should be devoted to
diversions with Pithamardas, Vitas, and Vidushakas,[21] and then should
be taken the midday sleep.[22] After this the householder, having put on
his clothes and ornaments, should, during the afternoon, converse with
his friends. In the evening there should be singing, and after that the
householder, along with his friend, should await in his room, previously
decorated and perfumed, the arrival of the woman that may be attached to
him, or he may send a female messenger for her, or go for her himself.
After her arrival at his house, he and his friend should welcome her,
and entertain her with a loving and agreeable conversation. Thus end the
duties of the day.
The following are the things to be done occasionally as diversions or
amusements.
1. Holding festivals[23] in honour of different Deities.
2. Social gatherings of both sexes.
3. Drinking parties.
4. Picnics.
5. Other social diversions.
_Festivals._
On some particular auspicious day, an assembly of citizens should be
convened in the temple of Saraswati.[24] There the skill of singers, and
of others who may have come recently to the town, should be tested, and
on the following day they should always be given some rewards. After
that they may either be retained or dismissed, according as their
performances are liked or not by the assembly. The members of the
assembly should act in concert, both in times of distress as well as in
times of prosperity, and it is also the duty of these citizens to show
hospitality to strangers who may have come to the assembly. What is said
above should be understood to apply to all the other festivals which may
be held in honour of the different Deities, according to the present
rules.
_Social Gatherings._
When men of the same age, disposition and talents, fond of the same
diversions and with the same degree of education, sit together in
company with public women,[25] or in an assembly of citizens, or at the
abode of one among themselves, and engage in agreeable discourse with
each other, such is called a sitting in company or a social gathering.
The subjects of discourse are to be the completion of verses half
composed by others, and the testing the knowledge of one another in the
various arts. The women who may be the most beautiful, who may like the
same things that the men like, and who may have power to attract the
minds of others, are here done homage to.
_Drinking Parties._
Men and women should drink in one another's houses. And here the men
should cause the public women to drink, and should then drink
themselves, liquors such as the Madhu, Aireya, Sara, and Asawa, which
are of bitter and sour taste; also drinks concocted from the barks of
various trees, wild fruits and leaves.
_Going to Gardens or Picnics._
In the forenoon, men, having dressed themselves should go to gardens on
horseback, accompanied by public women and followed by servants. And
having done there all the duties of the day, and passed the time in
various agreeable diversions, such as the fighting of quails, cocks and
rams, and other spectacles, they should return home in the afternoon in
the same manner, bringing with them bunches of flowers, &c.
The same also applies to bathing in summer in water from which wicked or
dangerous animals have previously been taken out, and which has been
built in on all sides.
_Other Social Diversions._
Spending nights playing with dice. Going out on moonlight nights.
Keeping the festive day in honour of spring. Plucking the sprouts and
fruits of the mangoe trees. Eating the fibres of lotuses. Eating the
tender ears of corn. Picnicing in the forests when the trees get their
new foliage. The Udakakashvedika or sporting in the water. Decorating
each other with the flowers of some trees. Pelting each other with the
flowers of the Kadamba tree, and many other sports which may either be
known to the whole country, or may be peculiar to particular parts of
it. These and similar other amusements should always be carried on by
citizens.
The above amusements should be followed by a person who diverts himself
alone in company with a courtesan, as well as by a courtesan who can do
the same in company with her maid servants or with citizens.
A Pithamarda[26] is a man without wealth, alone in the world, whose only
property consists of his Mallika,[27] some lathering, substance and a
red cloth, who comes from a good country, and who is skilled in all the
arts; and by teaching these arts is received in the company of citizens,
and in the abode of public women.
A Vita[28] is a man who has enjoyed the pleasures of fortune, who is a
compatriot of the citizens with whom he associates, who is possessed of
the qualities of a householder, who has his wife with him, and who is
honoured in the assembly of citizens, and in the abodes of public women,
and lives on their means and on them.
A Vidushaka[29] (also called a Vaihasaka, _i.e._, one who provokes
laughter) is a person only acquainted with some of the arts who is a
jester, and who is trusted by all.
These persons are employed in matters of quarrels and reconciliations
between citizens and public women.
This remark applies also to female beggars, to women with their heads
shaved, to adulterous women, and to old public women skilled in all the
various arts.
Thus a citizen living in his town or village, respected by all, should
call on the persons of his own caste who may be worth knowing. He should
converse in company and gratify his friends by his society, and obliging
others by his assistance in various matters, he should cause them to
assist one another in the same way.
There are some verses on this subject as follows:--
A citizen discoursing, not entirely in the Sanscrit language,[30] nor
wholly in the dialects of the country, on various topics in society,
obtains great respect. The wise should not resort to a society disliked
by the public, governed by no rules, and intent on the destruction of
others. But a learned man living in a society which acts according to
the wishes of the people, and which has pleasure for its only object is
highly respected in this world.

may be fairly considered that the courtesan was one of the elements, and
an important element too, of early Hindoo society, and that her
education and intellect were both superior to that of the women of the
household. Wilson says, By the Vesya or courtesan, however, we are not
to understand a female who has disregarded the obligation of law or the
precepts of virtue, but a character reared by a state of manners
unfriendly to the admission of wedded females into society, and opening
it only at the expense of reputation to women who were trained for
association with men by personal and mental acquirements to which the
matron was a stranger.]

of him that he is the humble companion, not the servant, of a prince or
man of rank, and it is a curious peculiarity that he is always a
Brahman. He bears more affinity to Sancho Panza, perhaps, than any other
character in western fiction, imitating him in his combination of
shrewdness and simplicity, his fondness of good living and his love of
ease. In the dramas of intrigue he exhibits some of the talents of
Mercury, but with less activity and ingenuity, and occasionally suffers
by his interference. According to the technical definition of his
attributes he is to excite mirth by being ridiculous in person, age, and
attire.]

CHAPTER V.
ABOUT THE KINDS OF WOMEN RESORTED TO BY THE CITIZENS, AND OF FRIENDS AND
MESSENGERS.
When Kama is practised by men of the four castes according to the rules
of the Holy Writ (_i.e._, by lawful marriage) with virgins of their own
caste, it then becomes a means of acquiring lawful progeny and good
fame, and it is not also opposed to the customs of the world. On the
contrary the practice of Kama with women of the higher castes, and with
those previously enjoyed by others, even though they be of the same
caste, is prohibited. But the practice of Kama with women of the lower
castes, with women excommunicated from their own caste, with public
women, and with women twice married,[31] is neither enjoined nor
prohibited. The object of practising Kama with such women is pleasure
only.
Nayikas,[32] therefore, are of three kinds, viz., maids, women twice
married, and public women. Gonikaputra has expressed an opinion that
there is a fourth kind of Nayika, viz., a woman who is resorted to on
some special occasion even though she be previously married to another.
These special occasions are when a man thinks thus:--
(_a_). This woman is self-willed, and has been previously enjoyed
by many others besides myself. I may, therefore, safely
resort to her as to a public woman though she belongs to a
higher caste than mine, and in so doing I shall not be
violating the ordinances of
Dharma.
Or thus:--
(_b_). This is a twice-married woman and has been enjoyed by others
before me, there is, therefore, no objection to my
resorting to her.
Or thus:--
(_c_). This woman has gained the heart of her great and powerful
husband, and exercises a mastery over him, who is a friend
of my enemy; if, therefore, she becomes united with me,
she will cause her husband to abandon my enemy.
Or thus:--
(_d_). This woman will turn the mind of her husband, who is very
powerful, in my favour, he being at present disaffected
towards me, and intent on doing me some harm.
Or thus:--
(_e_). By making this woman my friend I shall gain the object of
some friend of mine, or shall be able to effect the ruin
of some enemy, or shall accomplish some other difficult
purpose.
Or thus:--
(_f_). By being united with this woman, I shall kill her husband,
and so obtain his vast riches which I covet.
Or thus:--
(_g_). The union of this woman with me is not attended with any
danger, and will bring me wealth, of which, on account of
my poverty and inability to support myself, I am very much
in need. I shall, therefore, obtain her vast riches in
this way without any difficulty.
Or thus:--
(_h_). This woman loves me ardently, and knows all my weak points,
if therefore, I am unwilling to be united with her, she
will make my faults public, and thus tarnish my character
and reputation. Or she will bring some gross accusation
against me, of which it may be hard to clear myself, and I
shall be ruined. Or perhaps she will detach from me her
husband, who is powerful, and yet under her control, and
will unite him to my enemy, or will herself join the latter.
Or thus:--
(_i_). The husband of this woman has violated the chastity of my
wives, I shall therefore return that injury by seducing
his wives.
Or thus:--
(_j_). By the help of this woman I shall kill an enemy of the king,
who has taken shelter with her, and whom I am ordered by
the king to destroy.
Or thus:
(_k_). The woman whom I love is under the control of this woman. I
shall, through the influence of the latter, be able to get
at the former.
Or thus:--
(_l_). This woman will bring to me a maid, who possesses wealth and
beauty, but who is hard to get at, and under the control
of another.
Or, lastly, thus:--
(_m_). My enemy is a friend of this woman's husband, I shall
therefore cause her to join him, and will thus create an
enmity between her husband and him.
For these and similar other reasons the wives of other men may be
resorted to, but it must be distinctly understood that is only allowed
for special reasons, and not for mere carnal desire.
Charayana thinks that under these circumstances there is also a fifth
kind of Nayika, viz., a woman who is kept by a minister, and who repairs
to him occasionally; or a widow who accomplishes the purpose of a man
with the person to whom she resorts.
Suvarnanabha adds that a woman who passes the life of an ascetic and in
the condition of a widow may be considered as a sixth kind of Nayika.
Ghotakamukha says that the daughter of a public woman, and a female
servant, who are still virgins, form a seventh kind of Nayika.
Gonardiya puts forth his doctrine that any woman born of good family,
after she has come of age, is an eighth kind of Nayika.
But these four latter kinds of Nayikas do not differ much from the first
four kinds of them, as there is no separate object in resorting to
them. Therefore Vatsyayana is of opinion that there are only four kinds
of Nayikas, _i.e._, the maid, the twice married woman, the public woman,
and the woman resorted to for a special purpose.
The following women are not to be enjoyed:--
A leper.
A lunatic.
A woman turned out of caste.
A woman who reveals secrets.
A woman who publicly expresses desire for sexual intercourse.
A woman who is extremely white.
A woman who is extremely black.
A bad-smelling woman.
A woman who is a near relation.
A woman who is a female friend.
A woman who leads the life of an ascetic.
And, lastly, the wife of a relation, of a friend, of a learned Brahman,
and of the king.
The followers of Babhravya say that any woman who has been enjoyed by
five men is a fit and proper person to be enjoyed. But Gonikaputra is of
opinion that even when this is the case, the wives of a relation, of a
learned Brahman and of a king should be excepted.
The following are the kind of friends:--
One who has played with you in the dust, _i.e._, in childhood.
One who is bound by an obligation.
One who is of the same disposition and fond of the same things.
One who is a fellow student.
One who is acquainted with your secrets and faults, and whose faults and
secrets are also known to you.
One who is a child of your nurse.
One who is brought up with you.
One who is an hereditary friend.
These friends should possess the following qualities:--
They should tell the truth.
They should not be changed by time.
They should be favourable to your designs.
They should be firm.
They should be free from covetousness.
They should not be capable of being gained over by others.
They should not reveal your secrets.
Charayana says that citizens form friendship with washermen, barbers,
cowherds, florists, druggists, betel-leaf sellers, tavern keepers,
beggars, Pithamardas, Vitas and Vidushekas, as also with the wives of
all these people.
A messenger should possess the following qualities:--
Skilfulness.
Boldness.
Knowledge of the intention of men by their outward signs.
Absence of confusion, _i.e._, no shyness.
Knowledge of the exact meaning of what others do or say.
Good manners.
Knowledge of appropriate times and places for doing different things.
Ingenuity in business.
Quick comprehension.
Quick application of remedies, _i.e._, quick and ready resources.
And this part ends with a verse:--
The man who is ingenious and wise, who is accompanied by a friend, and
who knows the intentions of others, as also the proper time and place
for doing everything, can gain over, very easily, even a woman who is
very hard to be obtained.
FOOTNOTES:
[Footnote 31: This term does not apply to a widow, but to a woman who
had probably left her husband, and is living with some other person as a
married woman, maritalement, as they say in France.]
[Footnote 32: Any woman fit to be enjoyed without sin. The object of the
enjoyment of women is twofold, viz., pleasure and progeny. Any woman who
can be enjoyed without sin for the purpose of accomplishing either the
one or the other of these two objects is a Nayika. The fourth kind of
Nayika which Vatsya admits further on is neither enjoyed for pleasure or
for progeny, but merely for accomplishing some special purpose in hand.
The word Nayika is retained as a technical term throughout.]
=END OF PART I.=
PART II.
OF SEXUAL UNION.
CHAPTER I.
KINDS OF SEXUAL UNION ACCORDING TO
(_a_) DIMENSIONS.
(_b_) FORCE OF DESIRE OR PASSION.
(_c_) TIME.
_Kinds of Union._
Man is divided into three classes, viz., the hare man, the bull man, and
the horse man, according to the size of his lingam.
Woman also, according to the depth of her yoni, is either a female deer,
a mare, or a female elephant.
There are thus three equal unions between persons of corresponding
dimensions, and there are six unequal unions, when the dimensions do not
correspond, or nine in all, as the following table shows:
+--------------------+--------------------+
|      EQUAL.        |      UNEQUAL.      |
+--------------------+--------------------+
|  MEN.  |   WOMEN.  |  MEN.  | WOMEN.    |
+--------+-----------+--------|-----------+
|        |           |        |           |
| Hare.  | Deer.     | Hare.  | Mare.     |
| Bull.  | Mare.     | Hare.  | Elephant. |
| Horse. | Elephant. | Bull.  | Deer.     |
|        |           | Bull.  | Elephant. |
|        |           | Horse. | Deer.     |
|        |           | Horse. | Mare.     |
+--------+-----------+--------+-----------+
In these unequal unions, when the male exceeds the female in point of
size, his union with a woman who is immediately next to him in size is
called high union, and is of two kinds; while his union with the woman
most remote from him in size is called the highest union, and is of one
kind only. On the other hand when the female exceeds the male in point
of size, her union with a man immediately next to her in size is called
low union, and is of two kinds; while her union with a man most remote
from her in size is called the lowest union, and is of one kind only.
In other words, the horse and mare, the bull and deer, form the high
union, while the horse and deer form the highest union. On the female
side, the elephant and bull, the mare and hare, form low unions, while
the elephant and the hare make the lowest unions.
There are then, nine kinds of union according to dimensions. Amongst all
these, equal unions are the best, those of a superlative degree, _i.e._,
the highest and the lowest, are the worst, and the rest are middling,
and with them the high[33] are better than the low.
There are also nine kinds of union according to the force of passion or
carnal desire, as follows:
+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
|    MEN.   |   WOMEN.  |    MEN.   |   WOMEN.  |
+-----------+-----------+-----------|-----------+
|           |           |           |           |
| Small.    | Small.    | Small.    | Middling. |
| Middling. | Middling. | Small.    | Intense.  |
| Intense.  | Intense.  | Middling. | Small.    |
|           |           | Middling. | Intense.  |
|           |           | Intense.  | Small.    |
|           |           | Intense.  | Middling. |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
A man is called a man of small passion whose desire at the time of
sexual union is not great, whose semen is scanty, and who cannot bear
the warm embraces of the female.
Those who differ from this temperament are called men of middling
passion, while those of intense passion are full of desire.
In the same way, women are supposed to have the three degrees of feeling
as specified above.
Lastly, according to time there are three kinds of men and women, viz.,
the short-timed, the moderate-timed, and the long-timed, and of these as
in the previous statements, there are nine kinds of union.
But on this last head there is a difference of opinion about the female,
which should be stated.
Auddalika says, Females do not emit as males do. The males simply
remove their desire, while the females, from their consciousness of
desire, feel a certain kind of pleasure, which gives them satisfaction,
but it is impossible for them to tell you what kind of pleasure they
feel. The fact from which this becomes evident is, that males, when
engaged in coition, cease of themselves after emission, and are
satisfied, but it is not so with females.
This opinion is, however, objected to on the grounds that if a male be a
long-timed, the female loves him the more, but if he be short-timed, she
is dissatisfied with him. And this circumstance, some say, would prove
that the female emits also.
But this opinion does not hold good, for if it takes a long time to
allay a woman's desire, and during this time she is enjoying great
pleasure, it is quite natural then that she should wish for its
continuation. And on this subject there is a verse as follows:
By union with men the lust, desire, or passion of women is satisfied,
and the pleasure derived from the consciousness of it is called their
satisfaction.
The followers of Babhravya, however, say that the semen of women
continues to fall from the beginning of the sexual union to its end, and
it is right that it should be so, for if they had no semen there would
be no embryo.
To this there is an objection. In the beginning of coition the passion
of the woman is middling, and she cannot bear the vigorous thrusts of
her lover, but by degrees her passion increases until she ceases to
think about her body, and then finally she wishes to stop from further
coition.
This objection, however, does not hold good, for even in ordinary things
that revolve with great force, such as a potter's wheel, or a top, we
find that the motion at first is slow, but by degrees it becomes very
rapid. In the same way the passion of the woman having gradually
increased, she has a desire to discontinue coition, when all the semen
has fallen away. And there is a verse with regard to this as follows:
The fall of the semen of the man takes place only at the end of
coition, while the semen of the woman falls continually, and after the
semen of both has all fallen away then they wish for the discontinuance
of coition.[34]
Lastly, Vatsyayana is of opinion that the semen of the female falls in
the same way as that of the male.
Now some may ask here: If men and women are beings of the same kind, and
are engaged in bringing about the same result, why should they have
different works to do.
Vatsya says that this is so, because the ways of working as well as the
consciousness of pleasure in men and women are different. The difference
in the ways of working, by which men are the actors, and women are the
persons acted upon, is owing to the nature of the male and the female,
otherwise the actor would be sometimes the person acted upon, and vice
vers√¢. And from this difference in the ways of working follows the
difference in the consciousness of pleasure, for a man thinks, this
woman is united with me, and a woman thinks, I am united with this
man.
It may be said that if the ways of working in men and women are
different, why should not there be a difference, even in the pleasure
they feel, and which is the result of those ways.
But this objection is groundless, for the person acting and the person
acted upon being of different kinds, there is a reason for the
difference in their ways of working; but there is no reason for any
difference in the pleasure they feel, because they both naturally derive
pleasure from the act they perform.[35]
On this again some may say that when different persons are engaged in
doing the same work, we find that they accomplish the same end or
purpose: while, on the contrary, in the case of men and women we find
that each of them accomplishes his or her own end separately, and this
is inconsistent. But this is a mistake, for we find that sometimes two
things are done at the same time, as for instance in the fighting of
rams, both the rams receive the shock at the same time on their heads.
Again, in throwing one wood apple against another, and also in a fight
or struggle of wrestlers. If it be said that in these cases the things
employed are of the same kind, it is answered that even in the case of
men and women, the nature of the two persons is the same. And as the
difference in their ways of working arises from the difference of their
conformation only, it follows that men experience the same kind of
pleasure as women do.
There is also a verse on this subject as follows: Men and women being
of the same nature, feel the same kind of pleasure, and therefore a man
should marry such a woman as will love him ever afterwards.
The pleasure of men and women being thus proved to be of the same kind,
it follows that in regard to time, there are nine kinds of sexual
intercourse, in the same way as there are nine kinds, according to the
force of passion.
There being thus nine kinds of union with regard to dimensions, force of
passion, and time, respectively, by making combinations of them,
innumerable kinds of union would be produced. Therefore in each
particular kind of sexual union, men should use such means as they may
think suitable for the occasion.[36]
At the first time of sexual union the passion of the male is intense,
and his time is short, but in subsequent unions on the same day the
reverse of this is the case. With the female, however, it is the
contrary, for at the first time her passion is weak, and then her time
long, but on subsequent occasions on the same day, her passion is
intense and her time short, until her passion is satisfied.
_On the different kinds of Love._
Men learned in the humanities are of opinion that love is of four kinds,
viz.:
1. Love acquired by continual habit.
2. Love resulting from the imagination.
3. Love resulting from belief.
4. Love resulting from the perception of external objects.
(1). Love resulting from the constant and continual performance and
habit, as for instance the love of sexual intercourse, the love of
hunting, the love of drinking, the love of gambling, etc., etc.
(2). Love which is felt for things to which we are not habituated, and
which proceeds entirely from ideas, is called love resulting from
imagination, as for instance, that love which some men and women and
eunuchs feel for the Auparishtaka or mouth congress, and that which is
felt by all for such things as embracing, kissing, etc., etc.
(3). The love which is mutual on both sides, and proved to be true, when
each looks upon the other as his or her very own, such is called love
resulting from belief by the learned.
(4). The love resulting from the perception of eternal objects is quite
evident and well-known to the world, because the pleasure which it
affords is superior to the pleasure of the other kinds of love, which
exists only for its sake.
What has been said in this chapter upon the subject of sexual union is
sufficient for the learned; but for the edification of the ignorant, the
same will now be treated of at length and in detail.
FOOTNOTES:
[Footnote 33: High unions are said to be better than low ones, for in
the former it is possible for the male to satisfy his own passion
without injuring the female, while in the latter it is difficult for the
female to be satisfied by any means.]
[Footnote 34: The strength of passion with women varies a great deal,
some being easily satisfied, and others eager and willing to go on for a
long time. To satisfy these last thoroughly a man must have recourse to
art. It is certain that a fluid flows from the woman in larger or
smaller quantities, but her satisfaction is not complete until she has
experienced the spasme g√©n√™sique, as described in a French work
recently published and called Breviare de l'Amour Experimental par le
Dr. Jules Guyot.]
[Footnote 35: This is a long dissertation very common among Sanscrit
authors, both when writing and talking socially. They start certain
propositions, and then argue for and against them. What it is presumed
the author means, is, that though both men and women derive pleasure
from the act of coition, the way it is produced is brought about by
different means, each individual performing his own work in the matter,
irrespective of the other, and each deriving individually their own
consciousness of pleasure from the act they perform. There is a
difference in the work that each does, and a difference in the
consciousness of pleasure that each has, but no difference in the
pleasure they feel, for each feels that pleasure to a greater or lesser
degree.]
[Footnote 36: This paragraph should be particularly noted, for it
specially applies to married men and their wives. So many men utterly
ignore the feelings of the women, and never pay the slightest attention
to the passion of the latter. To understand the subject thoroughly, it
is absolutely necessary to study it, and then a person will know that,
as dough is prepared for baking, so must a woman be prepared for sexual
intercourse, if she is to derive satisfaction from it.]
CHAPTER II.
OF THE EMBRACE.
This part of the Kama Shastra, which treats of sexual union, is also
called Sixty-four (Chatushshashti). Some old authors say that it is
called so, because it contains sixty-four chapters. Others are of
opinion that the author of this part being a person named Panchala, and
the person who recited the part of the Rig Veda called Dashatapa, which
contains sixty-four verses, being also called Panchala, the name
sixty-four has been given to the part of the work in honour of the Rig
Vedas. The followers of Babhravya say on the other hand that this part
contains eight subjects, viz., the embrace, kissing, scratching with the
nails or fingers, biting, lying down, making various sounds, playing the
part of a man, and the Auparishtaka, or mouth congress. Each of these
subjects being of eight kinds, and eight multiplied by eight being
sixty-four, this part is therefore named sixty-four. But Vatsyayana
affirms that as this part contains also the following subjects, viz.,
striking, crying, the acts of a man during congress, the various kinds
of congress, and other subjects, the name sixty-four is given to it
only accidentally. As, for instance, we say this tree is Saptaparna,
or seven-leaved, this offering of rice is Panchavarna, or
five-coloured, but the tree has not seven leaves, neither has the rice
five colours.
However the part sixty-four is now treated of, and the embrace, being
the first subject, will now be considered.
Now the embrace which indicates the mutual love of a man and woman who
have come together is of four kinds, viz.:
Touching.
Piercing.
Rubbing.
Pressing.
The action in each case is denoted by the meaning of the word which
stands for it.
(1). When a man under some pretext or other goes in front or alongside
of a woman and touches her body with his own, it is called the touching
embrace.
(2). When a woman in a lonely place bends down, as if to pick up
something, and pierces, as it were, a man sitting or standing, with her
breasts, and the man in return takes hold of them, it is called a
piercing embrace.
The above two kinds of embrace takes place only between persons who do
not, as yet, speak freely with each other.
(3). When two lovers are walking slowly together, either in the dark, or
in a place of public resort, or in a lonely place, and rub their bodies
against each other, it is called a rubbing embrace.
(4). When on the above occasion one of them presses the other's body
forcibly against a wall or pillar, it is called a pressing embrace.
These two last embraces are peculiar to those who know the intentions of
each other.
At the time of the meeting the four following kinds of embrace are used,
viz.:
_Jataveshtitaka_, or the twining of a creeper.
_Vrikshadhirudhaka_, or climbing a tree.
_Tila-Tandulaka_, or the mixture of sesamum seed with rice.
_Kshiraniraka_, or milk and water embrace.
(1). When a woman, clinging to a man as a creeper twines round a tree,
bends his head down to hers with the desire of kissing him and slightly
makes the sound of sut sut, embraces him, and looks lovingly towards
him, it is called an embrace like the twining of a creeper.
(2). When a woman, having placed one of her feet on the foot of her
lover, and the other on one of his thighs, passes one of her arms round
his back, and the other on his shoulders, makes slightly the sounds of
singing and cooing, and wishes, as it were, to climb up him in order to
have a kiss, it is called an embrace like the climbing of a tree.
These two kinds of embrace take place when the lover is standing.
(3). When lovers lie on a bed, and embrace each other so closely that
the arms and thighs of the one are encircled by the arms and thighs of
the other, and are, as it were, rubbing up against them, this is called
an embrace like the mixture of sesamum seed with rice.
(4). When a man and a woman are very much in love with each other, and
not thinking of any pain or hurt, embrace each other as if they were
entering into each other's bodies, either while the woman is sitting on
the lap of the man or in front of him, or on a bed, then it is called an
embrace like a mixture of milk and water.
These two kinds of embrace take place at the time of sexual union.
Babhravya has thus related to us the above eight kinds of embraces.
Suvarnanabha, moreover, gives us four ways of embracing simple members
of the body, which are:
The embrace of the thighs.
The embrace of the jaghana, _i.e._, the part of the body from the navel
downwards to the thighs.
The embrace of the breasts.
The embrace of the forehead.
(1). When one of two lovers presses forcibly one or both of the thighs
of the other between his or her own, it is called the embrace of
thighs.
(2). When a man presses the jaghana or middle part of the woman's body
against his own, and mounts upon her to practise, either scratching with
the nail or finger, or biting, or striking, or kissing, the hair of the
woman being loose and flowing, it is called the embrace of the
jaghana.
(3). When a man places his breast between the breasts of a woman, and
presses her with it, it is called the embrace of the breasts.
(4). When either of the lovers touches the mouth, the eyes and the
forehead of the other with his or her own, it is called the embrace of
the forehead.
Some say that even shampooing is a kind of embrace, because there is a
touching of bodies in it. But Vatsyayana thinks that shampooing is
performed at a different time, and for a different purpose, and it is
also of a different character, it cannot be said to be included in the
embrace.
There are also some verses on the subject as follows: The whole subject
of embracing is of such a nature that men who ask questions about it, or
who hear about it, or who talk about it, acquire thereby a desire for
enjoyment. Even those embraces that are not mentioned in the Kama
Shastra should be practised at the time of sexual enjoyment, if they are
in any way conducive to the increase of love or passion. The rules of
the Shastra apply so long as the passion of man is middling, but when
the wheel of love is once set in motion, there is then no Shastra and no
order.
CHAPTER III.
ON KISSING.
It is said by some that there is no fixed time or order between the
embrace, the kiss, and the pressing or scratching with the nails or
fingers, but that all these things should be done generally before
sexual union takes place, while striking and making the various sounds
generally takes place at the time of the union. Vatsyayana, however,
thinks that anything may take place at any time, for love does not care
for time or order.
On the occasion of the first congress, kissing and the other things
mentioned above should be done moderately, they should not be continued
for a long time, and should be done alternately. On subsequent
occasions, however, the reverse of all this may take place, and
moderation will not be necessary, they may continue for a long time, and
for the purpose of kindling love, they may be all done at the same time.
The following are the places for kissing, viz., the forehead, the eyes,
the cheeks, the throat, the bosom, the breasts, the lips, and the
interior of the mouth. Moreover, the people of the Lat country kiss also
on the following places, viz., the joints of the thighs, the arms, and
the navel. But Vatsyayana thinks that though kissing is practised by
these people in the above places on account of the intensity of their
love, and the customs of their country, it is not fit to be practised by
all.
Now in a case of a young girl there are three sort of kisses, viz.:
The nominal kiss.
The throbbing kiss.
The touching kiss.
(1). When a girl only touches the mouth of her lover with her own, but
does not herself do anything, it is called the nominal kiss.
(2). When a girl, setting aside her bashfulness a little, wishes to
touch the lip that is pressed into her mouth, and with that object
moves her lower lip, but not the upper one, it is called the throbbing
kiss.
(3). When a girl touches her lover's lip with her tongue, and having
shut her eyes, places her hands on those of her lover, it is called the
touching kiss.
Other authors describe four other kinds of kisses, viz.:
The straight kiss.
The bent kiss.
The turned kiss.
The pressed kiss.
(1). When the lips of two lovers are brought into direct contact with
each other, it is called a straight kiss.
(2). When the heads of two lovers are bent towards each other, and when
so bent kissing takes place, it is called a bent kiss.
(3). When one of them turns up the face of the other by holding the head
and chin, and then kissing, it is called a turned kiss.
(4). Lastly, when the lower lip is pressed with much force, it is called
a pressed kiss.
There is also a fifth kind of kiss called the greatly pressed kiss,
which is effected by taking hold of the lower lip between two fingers,
and then after touching it with the tongue, pressing it with great force
with the lip.
As regards kissing, a wager may be laid as to which will get hold of the
lips of the other first. If the woman loses, she should pretend to cry,
should keep her lover off by shaking her hands, and turn away from him
and dispute with him, saying let another wager be laid. If she loses
this a second time, she should appear doubly distressed, and when her
lover is off his guard or asleep, she should get hold of his lower lip,
and hold it in her teeth, so that it should not slip away, and then she
should laugh, make a loud noise, deride him, dance about, and say
whatever she likes in a joking way, moving her eyebrows, and rolling her
eyes. Such are the wagers and quarrels as far as kissing is concerned,
but the same may be applied with regard to the pressing or scratching
with the nails and fingers, biting and striking. All these, however, are
only peculiar to men and women of intense passion.
When a man kisses the upper lip of a woman, while she in return kisses
his lower lip, it is called the kiss of the upper lip.
When one of them takes both the lips of the other between his or her
own, it is called a clasping kiss. A woman, however, only takes this
kind of kiss from a man who has no moustache. And on the occasion of
this kiss, if one of them touches the teeth, the tongue, and the palate
of the other, with his or her tongue, it is called the fighting of the
tongue. In the same way, the pressing of the teeth of the one against
the mouth of the other is to be practised.
Kissing is of four kinds, viz., moderate, contracted, pressed, and soft,
according to the different parts of the body which are kissed, for
different kinds of kisses are appropriate for different parts of the
body.
When a woman looks at the face of her lover while he is asleep, and
kisses it to show her intention or desire, it is called a kiss that
kindles love.
When a woman kisses her lover while he is engaged in business, or while
he is quarrelling with her, or while he is looking at something else, so
that his mind may be turned away, it is called a kiss that turns away.
When a lover coming home late at night kisses his beloved, who is asleep
or in bed, in order to show her his desire, it is called a kiss that
awakens. On such an occasion the woman may pretend to be asleep at the
time of her lover's arrival, so that she may know his intention and
obtain respect from him.
When a person kisses the reflection of the person he loves in a mirror,
in water, or on a wall, it is called a kiss showing the intention.
When a person kisses a child sitting on his lap, or a picture, or an
image, or figure, in the presence of the person beloved by him, it is
called a transferred kiss.
When at night at a theatre, or in an assembly of caste men, a man coming
up to a woman kisses a finger of her hand if she be standing, or a toe
of her foot if she be sitting, or when a woman is shampooing her lover's
body, places her face on his thigh (as if she was sleepy) so as to
inflame his passion, and kisses his thigh or great toe, it is called a
demonstrative kiss.
There is also a verse on the subject as follows:--
Whatever things may be done by one of the lovers to the other, the same
should be returned by the other, _i.e._, if the woman kisses him he should
kiss her in return, if she strikes him he should also strike her in
return.
CHAPTER IV.
ON PRESSING, OR MARKING, OR SCRATCHING WITH THE NAILS.
When love becomes intense, pressing with the nails or scratching the
body with them is practised, and it is done on the following occasions:
On the first visit; at the time of setting out on a journey; on the
return from a journey; at the time when an angry lover is reconciled;
and lastly when the woman is intoxicated.
But pressing with the nails is not an usual thing except with those who
are intensely passionate, _i.e._, full of passion. It is employed together
with biting, by those to whom the practice is agreeable.
Pressing with the nails is of the eight following kinds, according to
the forms of the marks which are produced, viz.:
1. Sounding.
2. Half moon.
3. A circle.
4. A line.
5. A tiger's nail or claw.
6. A peacock's foot.
7. The jump of a hare.
8. The leaf of a blue lotus.
The places that are to be pressed with the nails are as follows: the arm
pit, the throat, the breasts, the lips, the jaghana, or middle parts of
the body, and the thighs. But Suvarnanabha is of opinion that when the
impetuosity of passion is excessive, then the places need not be
considered.
The qualities of good nails are that they should be bright, well set,
clean, entire, convex, soft, and glossy in appearance. Nails are of
three kinds according to their size, viz.:
Small.
Middling.
Large.
Large nails, which give grace to the hands, and attract the hearts of
women from their appearance, are possessed by the Bengalees.
Small nails, which can be used in various ways, and are to be applied
only with the object of giving pleasure, are possessed by the people of
the southern districts.
Middling nails, which contain the properties of both the above kinds,
belong to the people of the Maharashtra.
(1). When a person presses the chin, the breasts, the lower lip, or the
jaghana of another so softly that no scratch or mark is left, but only
the hair on the body becomes erect from the touch of the nails, and the
nails themselves make a sound, it is called a sounding or pressing with
the nails.
This pressing is used in the case of a young girl when her lover
shampoos her, scratches her head, and wants to trouble or frighten her.
(2). The curved mark with the nails, which is impressed on the neck and
the breasts, is called the half moon.
(3). When the half moons are impressed opposite to each other, it is
called a circle. This mark with the nails is generally made on the
navel, the small cavities about the buttocks, and on the joints of the
thigh.
(4). A mark in the form of a small line, and which can be made on any
part of the body, is called a line.
(5). This same line, when it is curved, and made on the breast, is
called a tiger's nail.
(6). When a curved mark is made on the breast by means of the five
nails, it is called a peacock's foot. This mark is made with the
object of being praised, for it requires a great deal of skill to make
it properly.
(7). When five marks with the nails are made close to one another near
the nipple of the breast, it is called the jump of a hare.
(8). A mark made on the breast or on the hips in the form of a leaf of
the blue lotus, is called the leaf of a blue lotus.
When a person is going on a journey, and makes a mark on the thighs, or
on the breast, it is called a token of remembrance. On such an
occasion three or four lines are impressed close to one another with the
nails.
Here ends the marking with the nails. Marks of other kinds than the
above may also be made with the nails, for the ancient authors say,
that as there are innumerable degrees of skill among men (the practice
of this art being known to all), so there are innumerable ways of making
these marks. And as pressing or marking with the nails is independent of
love, no one can say with certainty how many different kinds of marks
with the nails do actually exist. The reason of this is, Vatsyayana
says, that as variety is necessary in love, so love is to be produced by
means of variety. It is on this account that courtezans, who are well
acquainted with various ways and means, become so desirable, for if
variety is sought in all the arts and amusements, such as archery and
others, how much more should it be sought after in the present case.
The marks of the nails should not be made on married women, but
particular kinds of marks may be made on their private parts for the
remembrance and increase of love.
There are also some verses on the subject, as follows:
The love of a woman who sees the marks of nails on the private parts of
her body, even though they are old and almost worn out, becomes again
fresh and new. If there be no marks of nails to remind a person of the
passages of love, then love is lessened in the same way as when no union
takes place for a long time.
Even when a stranger sees at a distance a young woman with the marks of
nails on her breast,[37] he is filled with love and respect for her.
A man, also, who carries the marks of nails and teeth on some parts of
his body, influences the mind of a woman, even though it be ever so
firm. In short, nothing tends to increase love so much as the effects of
marking with the nails, and biting.
FOOTNOTE:
[Footnote 37: From this it would appear that in ancient times the
breasts of women were not covered, and this is seen in the painting of
the Ajunta and other caves, where we find that the breasts of even royal
ladies and others are exposed.]
CHAPTER V.
ON BITING, AND THE MEANS TO BE EMPLOYED WITH REGARD TO WOMEN OF
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES.
All the places that can be kissed, are also the places that can be
bitten, except the upper lip, the interior of the mouth, and the eyes.
The qualities of good teeth are as follows: They should be equal,
possessed of a pleasing brightness, capable of being coloured, of proper
proportions, unbroken, and with sharp ends.
The defects of teeth on the other hand are, that they are blunt,
protruding from the gums, rough, soft, large, and loosely set.
The following are the different kinds of biting, viz.:
The hidden bite.
The swollen bite.
The point.
The line of points.
The coral and the jewel.
The line of jewels.
The broken cloud.
The biting of the boar.
(1). The biting which is shown only by the excessive redness of the skin
that is bitten, is called the hidden bite.
(2). When the skin is pressed down on both sides, it is called the
swollen bite.
(3). When a small portion of the skin is bitten with two teeth only, it
is called the point.
(4). When such small portions of the skin are bitten with all the teeth,
it is called the line of points.
(5). The biting which is done by bringing together the teeth and the
lips, is called the coral and the jewel. The lip is the coral, and the
teeth the jewel.
(6). When biting is done with all the teeth, it is called the line of
jewels.
(7). The biting which consists of unequal risings in a circle, and which
comes from the space between the teeth, is called the broken cloud.
This is impressed on the breasts.
(8). The biting which consists of many broad rows of marks near to one
another, and with red intervals, is called the biting of a boar. This
is impressed on the breasts and the shoulders; and these two last modes
of biting are peculiar to persons of intense passion.
The lower lip is the place on which the hidden bite, the swollen
bite, and the point are made; again the swollen bite, and the
coral and the jewel bite are done on the cheek. Kissing, pressing with
the nails, and biting are the ornaments of the left cheek, and when the
word cheek is used it is to be understood as the left cheek.
Both the line of points and the line of jewels are to be impressed
on the throat, the arm pit, and the joints of the thighs; but the line
of points alone is to be impressed on the forehead and the thighs.
The marking with the nails, and the biting of the following things,
viz., an ornament of the forehead, an ear ornament, a bunch of flowers,
a betel leaf, or a tamala leaf, which are worn by, or belong to the
woman that is beloved, are signs of the desire of enjoyment.
Here end the different kinds of biting.
*       *       *       *       *
In the affairs of love a man should do such things as are agreeable to
the women of different countries.
The women of the central countries (_i.e._, between the Ganges and the
Jumna) are noble in their character, not accustomed to disgraceful
practices, and dislike pressing the nails and biting.
The women of the Balhika country are gained over by striking.
The women of Avantika are fond of foul pleasures, and have not good
manners.
The women of the Maharashtra are fond of practising the sixty-four arts,
they utter low and harsh words, and like to be spoken to in the same
way, and have an impetuous desire of enjoyment.
The women of Pataliputra (_i.e._, the modern Patna) are of the same nature
as the women of the Maharashtra, but show their likings only in secret.
The women of the Dravida country, though they are rubbed and pressed
about at the time of sexual enjoyment, have a slow fall of semen, that
is they are very slow in the act of coition.
The women of Vanavasi are moderately passionate, they go through every
kind of enjoyment, cover their bodies, and abuse those who utter low,
mean and harsh words.
The women of Avanti hate kissing, marking with the nails, and biting,
but they have a fondness for various kinds of sexual union.
The women of Malwa like embracing and kissing, but not wounding, and
they are gained over by striking.
The women of Abhira, and those of the country about the Indus and five
rivers (_i.e._, the Punjab), are gained over by the Auparishtaka or mouth
congress.
The women of Aparatika are full of passion, and make slowly the sound
Sit.
The women of the Lat country have even more impetuous desire, and also
make the sound Sit.
The women of the Stri Rajya, and of Koshola (Oude), are full of
impetuous desire, their semen falls in large quantities, and they are
fond of taking medicine to make it do so.
The women of the Audhra country have tender bodies, they are fond of
enjoyment, and have a liking for voluptuous pleasures.
The women of Ganda have tender bodies, and speak sweetly.
Now Suvarnanabha is of opinion that that which is agreeable to the
nature of a particular person, is of more consequence than that which is
agreeable to a whole nation, and that therefore the peculiarities of the
country should not be observed in such cases. The various pleasures, the
dress, and the sports of one country are in time borrowed by another,
and in such a case these things must be considered as belonging
originally to that country.
Among the things mentioned above, viz., embracing, kissing, etc., those
which increase passion should be done first, and those which are only
for amusement or variety should be done afterwards.
There are also some verses on this subject as follows:
When a man bites a woman forcibly, she should angrily do the same to
him with double force. Thus a 'point' should be returned with a 'line of
points,' and a 'line of points' with a 'broken cloud,' and if she be
excessively chafed, she should at once begin a love quarrel with him. At
such a time she should take hold of her lover by the hair, and bend his
head down, and kiss his lower lip, and then, being intoxicated with
love, she should shut her eyes and bite him in various places. Even by
day, and in a place of public resort, when her lover shows her any mark
that she may have inflicted on his body, she should smile at the sight
of it, and turning her face as if she were going to chide him, she
should show him with an angry look the marks on her own body that have
been made by him. Thus if men and women act according to each other's
liking, their love for each other will not be lessened even in one
hundred years.
CHAPTER VI.
OF THE DIFFERENT WAYS OF LYING DOWN, AND VARIOUS KINDS OF CONGRESS.
On the occasion of a high congress the Mrigi (Deer) woman should lie
down in such a way as to widen her yoni, while in a low congress the
Hastini (Elephant) woman should lie down so as to contract hers. But in
an equal congress they should lie down in the natural position. What
is said above concerning the Mrigi and the Hastini applies also to the
Vadawa (Mare) woman. In a low congress the women should particularly
make use of medicine, to cause her desires to be satisfied quickly.
The Deer-woman has the following three ways of lying down.
The widely opened position.
The yawning position.
The position of the wife of Indra.
(1). When she lowers her head and raises her middle parts, it is called
the widely opened position. At such a time the man should apply some
unguent, so as to make the entrance easy.
(2). When she raises her thighs and keeps them wide apart and engages in
congress, it is called the yawning position.
(3). When she places her thighs with her legs doubled on them upon her
sides, and thus engages in congress, it is called the position of
Indrani, and this is learnt only by practice. The position is also
useful in the case of the highest congress.
The clasping position is used in low congress, and in the lowest
congress, together with the pressing position, the twining
position, and the mare's position.
When the legs of both the male and the female are stretched straight
out over each other, it is called the clasping position. It is of two
kinds, the side position and the supine position, according to the way
in which they lie down. In the side position the male should invariably
lie on his left side, and cause the woman to lie on her right side, and
this rule is to be observed in lying down with all kinds of women.
When, after congress has begun in the clasping position, the woman
presses her lover with her thighs, it is called the pressing position.
When the woman places one of her thighs across the thigh of her lover,
it is called the twining position.
When a woman forcibly holds in her yoni the lingam after it is in, it is
called the mare's position. This is learnt by practice only, and is
chiefly found among the women of the Andra country.
The above are the different ways of lying down, mentioned by Babhravya;
Suvarnanabha, however, gives the following in addition.
When the female raises both of her thighs straight up, it is called the
rising position.
When she raises both of her legs, and places them on her lover's
shoulders, it is called the yawning position.
When the legs are contracted, and thus held by the lover before his
bosom, it is called the pressed position.
When only one of her legs is stretched out, it is called the half
pressed position.
When the woman places one of her legs on her lover's shoulder, and
stretches the other out, and then places the latter on his shoulder, and
stretches out the other, and continues to do so alternately, it is
called the splitting of a bamboo.
When one of her legs is placed on the head, and the other is stretched
out, it is called the fixing of a nail. This is learnt by practice
only.
When both the legs of the woman are contracted, and placed on her
stomach, it is called the crab's position.
When the thighs are raised and placed one upon the other, it is called
the packed position.
When the shanks are placed one upon the other, it is called the
lotus-like position.
When a man, during congress, turns round, and enjoys the woman without
leaving her, while she embraces him round the back all the time, it is
called the turning position, and is learnt only by practice.
Thus says Suvarnanabha, these different ways of lying down, sitting, and
standing should be practised in water, because it is easy to do so
therein. But Vatsyayana is of opinion that congress in water is
improper, because it is prohibited by the religious law.
When a man and a woman support themselves on each other's bodies, or on
a wall, or pillar, and thus while standing engage in congress, it is
called the supported congress.
When a man supports himself against a wall, and the woman, sitting on
his hands joined together and held underneath her, throws her arms round
his neck, and putting her thighs alongside his waist, moves herself by
her feet, which are touching the wall against which the man is leaning,
it is called the suspended congress.
When a woman stands on her hands and feet like a quadruped, and her
lover mounts her like a bull, it is called the congress of a cow. At
this time everything that is ordinarily done on the bosom should be done
on the back.
In the same way can be carried on the congress of a dog, the congress of
a goat, the congress of a deer, the forcible mounting of an ass, the
congress of a cat, the jump of a tiger, the pressing of an elephant, the
rubbing of a boar, and the mounting of a horse. And in all these cases
the characteristics of these different animals should be manifested by
acting like them.
When a man enjoys two women at the same time, both of whom love him
equally, it is called the united congress.
When a man enjoys many women altogether, it is called the congress of a
herd of cows.
The following kinds of congress, viz., sporting in water, or the
congress of an elephant with many female elephants, which is said to
take place only in the water, the congress of a collection of goats, the
congress of a collection of deer, take place in imitation of these
animals.
In Gramaneri many young men enjoy a woman that may be married to one of
them, either one after the other, or at the same time. Thus one of them
holds her, another enjoys her, a third uses her mouth, a fourth holds
her middle part, and in this way they go on enjoying her several parts
alternately.
The same things can be done when several men are sitting in company with
one courtesan, or when one courtesan is alone with many men. In the same
way this can be done by the women of the King's harem when they
accidentally get hold of a man.
The people in the Southern countries have also a congress in the anus,
that is called the lower congress.
Thus ends the various kinds of congress. There are also two verses on
the subject as follows.
An ingenious person should multiply the kinds of congress after the
fashion of the different kinds of beasts and of birds. For these
different kinds of congress, performed according to the usage of each
country, and the liking of each individual, generate love, friendship,
and respect in the hearts of women.
CHAPTER VII.
OF THE VARIOUS MODES OF STRIKING, AND OF THE SOUNDS APPROPRIATE TO THEM.
Sexual intercourse can be compared to a quarrel, on account of the
contrarieties of love and its tendency to dispute. The place of striking
with passion is the body, and on the body the special places are:
The shoulders.
The head.
The space between the breasts.
The back.
The jaghana, or middle part of the body.
The sides.
Striking is of four kinds, viz.:
Striking with the back of the hand.
Striking with the fingers a little contracted.
Striking with the fist.
Striking with the open palm of the hand.
On account of its causing pain, striking gives rise to the hissing
sound, which is of various kinds, and to the eight kinds of crying,
viz.:
The sound Hin.
The thundering sound.
The cooing sound.
The weeping sound.
The sound Phut.
The sound Ph√¢t.
The sound S√ªt.
The sound Pl√¢t.
Besides these, there are also words having a meaning, such as mother,
and those that are expressive of prohibition, sufficiency, desire of
liberation, pain or praise, and to which may be added sounds like those
of the dove, the cuckoo, the green pigeon, the parrot, the bee, the
sparrow, the flamingo, the duck, and the quail, which are all
occasionally made use of.
Blows with the fist should be given on the back of the woman, while she
is sitting on the lap of the man, and she should give blows in return,
abusing the man as if she were angry, and making the cooing and the
weeping sounds. While the woman is engaged in congress the space between
the breasts should be struck with the back of the hand, slowly at first,
and then proportionately to the increasing excitement, until the end.
At this time the sounds Hin and others may be made, alternately or
optionally, according to habit. When the man, making the sound Ph√¢t,
strikes the woman on the head, with the fingers of his hand a little
contracted, it is called Prasritaka, which means striking with the
fingers of the hand a little contracted. In this case the appropriate
sounds are the cooing sound, the sound Ph√¢t, and the sound Phut in the
interior of the mouth, and at the end of congress the sighing and
weeping sounds. The sound Ph√¢t is an imitation of the sound of a bamboo
being split, while the sound Phut is like the sound made by something
falling into water. At all times when kissing and such like things are
begun, the woman should give a reply with a hissing sound. During the
excitement when the woman is not accustomed to striking, she continually
utters words expressive of prohibition, sufficiently, or desire of
liberation, as well as the words father, mother, intermingled with
the sighing, weeping and thundering sounds.[38] Towards the conclusion
of the congress, the breasts, the jaghana, and the sides of the woman
should be pressed with the open palms of the hand, with some force,
until the end of it, and then sounds like those of the quail, or the
goose should be made.
There are also two verses on the subject as follows:
The characteristics of manhood are said to consist of roughness and
impetuosity, while weakness, tenderness, sensibility, and an inclination
to turn away from unpleasant things are the distinguishing marks of
womanhood. The excitement of passion, and peculiarities of habit may
sometimes cause contrary results to appear, but these do not last long,
and in the end the natural state is resumed.
The wedge on the bosom, the scissors on the head, the piercing
instrument on the cheeks, and the pinchers on the breasts and sides, may
also be taken into consideration with the other four modes of striking,
and thus give eight ways altogether. But these four ways of striking
with instruments are peculiar to the people of the southern countries,
and the marks caused by them are seen on the breasts of their women.
They are local peculiarities, but Vatsyayana is of opinion that the
practice of them is painful, barbarous, and base, and quite unworthy of
imitation.
In the same way anything that is a local peculiarity should not always
be adopted elsewhere, and even in the place where the practice is
prevalent, excess of it should always be avoided. Instances of the
dangerous use of them may be given as follows. The King of the Panchalas
killed the courtezan Madhavasena by means of the wedge during congress.
King Shatakarni Shatavahana of the Kuntalas deprived his great Queen
Malayavati of her life by a pair of scissors, and Naradeva, whose hand
was deformed, blinded a dancing girl by directing a piercing instrument
in a wrong way.
There are also two verses on the subject as follows:
About these things there cannot be either enumeration or any definite
rule. Congress having once commenced, passion alone gives birth to all
the acts of the parties.
Such passionate actions and amorous gesticulations or movements, which
arise on the spur of the moment, and during sexual intercourse, cannot
be defined, and are as irregular as dreams. A horse having once attained
the fifth degree of motion goes on with blind speed, regardless of pits,
ditches, and posts in his way; and in the same manner a loving pair
become blind with passion in the heat of congress, and go on with great
impetuosity, paying not the least regard to excess. For this reason one
who is well acquainted with the science of love, and knowing his own
strength, as also the tenderness, impetuosity, and strength of the young
woman, should act accordingly. The various modes of enjoyment are not
for all times or for all persons, but they should only be used at the
proper time, and in the proper countries and places.
FOOTNOTE:
[Footnote 38: Men who are well acquainted with the art of love are well
aware how often one woman differs from another in her sighs and sounds
during the time of congress. Some women like to be talked to in the most
loving way, others in the most abusive way, and so on. Some women enjoy
themselves with closed eyes in silence, others make a great noise over
it, and some almost faint away. The great art is to ascertain what gives
them the greatest pleasure, and what specialities they like best.]
CHAPTER VIII.
ABOUT WOMEN ACTING THE PART OF A MAN; AND OF THE WORK OF A MAN.
When a woman sees that her lover is fatigued by constant congress,
without having his desire satisfied, she should, with his permission,
lay him down upon his back, and give him assistance by acting his part.
She may also do this to satisfy the curiosity of her lover, or her own
desire of novelty.
There are two ways of doing this, the first is when during congress she
turns round, and gets on the top of her lover, in such a manner as to
continue the congress, without obstructing the pleasure of it; and the
other is when she acts the man's part from the beginning. At such a
time, with flowers in her hair hanging loose, and her smiles broken by
hard breathings, she should press upon her lover's bosom with her own
breasts, and lowering her head frequently, should do in return the same
actions which he used to do before, returning his blows and chaffing
him, should say, I was laid down by you, and fatigued with hard
congress, I shall now therefore lay you down in return. She should then
again manifest her own bashfulness, her fatigue, and her desire of
stopping the congress. In this way she should do the work of a man,
which we shall presently relate.
Whatever is done by a man for giving pleasure to a woman is called the
work of a man, and is as follows:--
While the woman is lying on his bed, and is as it were abstracted by his
conversation, he should loosen the knot of her under garments, and when
she begins to dispute with him, he should overwhelm her with kisses.
Then when his lingam is erect he should touch her with his hands in
various places, and gently manipulate various parts of the body. If the
woman is bashful, and if it is the first time that they have come
together, the man should place his hands between her thighs, which she
would probably keep close together, and if she is a very young girl, he
should first get his hands upon her breasts, which she would probably
cover with her own hands, and under her armpits and on her neck. If
however she is a seasoned woman, he should do whatever is agreeable
either to him or to her, and whatever is fitting for the occasion. After
this he should take hold of her hair, and hold her chin in his fingers
for the purpose of kissing her. On this, if she is a young girl, she
will become bashful and close her eyes. Any how he should gather from
the action of the woman what things would be pleasing to her during
congress.
Here Suvarnanabha says that while a man is doing to the woman what he
likes best during congress, he should always make a point of pressing
those parts of her body on which she turns her eyes.
The signs of the enjoyment and satisfaction of the women are as follows:
her body relaxes, she closes her eyes, she puts aside all bashfulness,
and shows increased willingness to unite the two organs as closely
together as possible. On the other hand, the signs of her want of
enjoyment and of failing to be satisfied are as follows: she shakes her
hands, she does not let the man get up, feels dejected, bites the man,
kicks him, and continues to go on moving after the man has finished. In
such cases the man should rub the yoni of the woman with his hand and
fingers (as the elephant rubs anything with his trunk) before engaging
in congress, until it is softened, and after that is done he should
proceed to put his lingam into her.
The acts to be done by the man are:
Moving forward.
Friction or churning.
Piercing.
Rubbing.
Pressing.
Giving a blow.
The blow of a boar.
The blow of a bull.
The sporting of a sparrow.
(1). When the organs are brought together properly and directly it is
called moving the organ forward.
(2). When the lingam is held with the hand, and turned all round in the
yoni, it is called churning.
(3). When the yoni is lowered, and the upper part of it is struck with
the lingam, it is called piercing.
(4). When the same thing is done on the lower part of the yoni, it is
called rubbing.
(5). When the yoni is pressed by the lingam for a long time, it is
called pressing.
(6). When the lingam is removed to some distance from the yoni, and then
forcibly strikes it, it is called giving a blow.
(7). When only one part of the yoni is rubbed with the lingam, it is
called the blow of a boar.
(8). When both sides of the yoni are rubbed in this way, it is called
the blow of a bull.
(9). When the lingam is in the yoni, and moved up and down frequently,
and without being taken out, it is called the sporting of a sparrow.
This takes place at the end of congress.
When a woman acts the part of a man, she has the following things to do
in addition to the nine given above, viz.
The pair of tongs.
The top.
The swing.
(1). When the woman holds the lingam in her yoni, draws it in, presses
it, and keeps it thus in her for a long time, it is called the pair of
tongs.
(2). When, while engaged in congress, she turns round like a wheel, it
is called the top. This is learnt by practice only.
(3). When, on such an occasion, the man lifts up the middle part of his
body, and the woman turns round her middle part, it is called the
swing.
When the woman is tired, she should place her forehead on that of her
lover, and should thus take rest without disturbing the union of the
organs, and when the woman has rested herself the man should turn round
and begin the congress again.
There are also some verses on the subject as follows:
Though a woman is reserved, and keeps her feelings concealed, yet when
she gets on the top of a man, she then shows all her love and desire. A
man should gather from the actions of the woman of what disposition she
is, and in what way she likes to be enjoyed. A woman during her monthly
courses, a woman who has been lately confined, and a fat woman should
not be made to act the part of a man.
CHAPTER XI.
OF THE AUPARISHTAKA[39] OR MOUTH CONGRESS.
There are two kinds of eunuchs, those that are disguised as males, and
those that are disguised as females. Eunuchs disguised as females
imitate their dress, speech, gestures, tenderness, timidity, simplicity,
softness and bashfulness. The acts that are done on the jaghana or
middle parts of women, are done in the mouths of these eunuchs, and this
is called Auparishtaka. These eunuchs derive their imaginable pleasure,
and their livelihood from this kind of congress, and they lead the life
of courtezans. So much concerning eunuchs disguised as females.
Eunuchs disguised as males keep their desires secret, and when they wish
to do anything they lead the life of shampooers. Under the pretence of
shampooing, an eunuch of this kind embraces and draws towards himself
the thighs of the man whom he is shampooing, and after this he touches
the joints of his thighs and his jaghana, or central portions of his
body. Then, if he finds the lingam of the man erect, he presses it with
his hands, and chaffs him for getting into that state. If after this,
and after knowing his intention, the man does not tell the eunuch to
proceed, then the latter does it of his own accord and begins the
congress. If however he is ordered by the man to do it, then he disputes
with him, and only consents at last with difficulty.
The following eight things are then done by the eunuch one after the
other, viz.
The nominal congress.
Biting the sides.
Pressing outside.
Pressing inside.
Kissing.
Rubbing.
Sucking a mangoe fruit.
Swallowing up.
At the end of each of these the eunuch expresses his wish to stop, but
when one of them is finished, the man desires him to do another, and
after that is done, then the one that follows it, and so on.
(1). When, holding the man's lingam with his hand, and placing it
between his lips, the eunuch moves about his mouth, it is called the
nominal congress.
(2). When, covering the end of the lingam with his fingers collected
together like the bud of a plant or flower, the eunuch presses the sides
of it with his lips, using his teeth also, it is called biting the
sides.
(3). When, being desired to proceed, the eunuch presses the end of the
lingam with his lips closed together, and kisses it as if he were
drawing it out, it is called the outside pressing.
(4). When, being asked to go on, he put the lingam further into his
mouth, and presses it with his lips and then takes it out, it is called
the inside pressing.
(5). When, holding the lingam in his hand, the eunuch kisses it as if he
were kissing the lower lip, it is called kissing.
(6). When, after kissing it, he touches it with his tongue everywhere,
and passes the tongue over the end of it, it is called rubbing.
(7). When, in the same way, he puts the half of it into his mouth, and
forcibly kisses and sucks it, this is called sucking a mangoe fruit.
(8). And lastly, when, with the consent of the man, the eunuch puts the
whole lingam into his mouth, and presses it to the very end, as if he
were going to swallow it up, it is called swallowing up.
Striking, scratching, and other things may also be done during this kind
of congress.
The Auparishtaka is practised only by unchaste and wanton women, female
attendants and serving maids, _i.e._, those who are not married to
anybody, but who live by shampooing.
The Acharyas (_i.e._, ancient and venerable authors) are of opinion that
this Auparishtaka is the work of a dog and not of a man, because it is a
low practice, and opposed to the orders of the Holy Writ, and because
the man himself suffers by bringing his lingam into contact with the
mouths of eunuchs and women. But Vatsyayana says that the orders of the
Holy Writ do not affect those who resort to courtezans, and the law
prohibits the practice of the Auparishtaka with married women only. As
regards the injury to the male, that can be easily remedied.
The people of Eastern India do not resort to women who practise the
Auparishtaka.
The people of Ahichhatra resort to such women, but do nothing with them,
so far as the mouth is concerned.
The people of Saketa do with these women every kind of mouth congress,
while the people of Nagara do not practise this, but do every other
thing.
The people of the Shurasena country, on the southern bank of the Jumna,
do everything without any hesitation, for they say that women being
naturally unclean, no one can be certain about their character, their
purity, their conduct, their practices, their confidences, or their
speech. They are not however on this account to be abandoned, because
religious law, on the authority of which they are reckoned pure, lays
down that the udder of a cow is clean at the time of milking, though the
mouth of a cow, and also the mouth of her calf, are considered unclean
by the Hindoos. Again a dog is clean when he seizes a deer in hunting,
though food touched by a dog is otherwise considered very unclean. A
bird is clean when it causes a fruit to fall from a tree by pecking at
it, though things eaten by crows and other birds are considered unclean.
And the mouth of a woman is clean for kissing and such like things at
the time of sexual intercourse. Vatsyayana moreover thinks that in all
these things connected with love, everybody should act according to the
custom of his country, and his own inclination.
There are also the following verses on the subject.
The male servants of some men carry on the mouth congress with their
masters. It is also practised by some citizens, who know each other
well, among themselves. Some women of the harem, when they are amorous,
do the acts of the mouth on the yonis of one another, and some men do
the same thing with women. The way of doing this (_i.e._, of kissing the
yoni) should be known from kissing the mouth. When a man and woman lie
down in an inverted order, _i.e._, with the head of the one towards the
feet of the other and carry on this congress, it is called the congress
of a crow.
For the sake of such things courtezans abandon men possessed of good
qualities, liberal and clever, and become attached to low persons, such
as slaves and elephant drivers. The Auparishtaka, or mouth congress,
should never be done by a learned Brahman, by a minister that carries on
the business of a state, or by a man of good reputation, because though
the practice is allowed by the Shastras, there is no reason why it
should be carried on, and need only be practised in particular cases. As
for instance, the taste, and the strength, and the digestive qualities
of the flesh of dogs are mentioned in works on medicine, but it does not
therefore follow that it should be eaten by the wise. In the same way
there are some men, some places and some times, with respect to which
these practices can be made use of. A man should therefore pay regard to
the place, to the time, and to the practice which is to be carried out,
as also as to whether it is agreeable to his nature and to himself, and
then he may or may not practise these things according to circumstances.
But after all, these things being done secretly, and the mind of the man
being fickle, how can it be known what any person will do at any
particular time and for any particular purpose.
FOOTNOTE:
[Footnote 39: This practice appears to have been prevalent in some parts
of India from a very ancient time. The Shushruta, a work on medicine
some two thousand years old, describes the wounding of the lingam with
the teeth as one of the causes of a disease treated upon in that work.
Traces of the practice are found as far back as the eighth century, for
various kinds of the Auparishtaka are represented in the sculptures of
many Shaiva temples at Bhuvaneshwara, near Cuttack, in Orissa, and which
were built about that period. From these sculptures being found in such
places, it would seem that this practice was popular in that part of the
country at that time. It does not seem to be so prevalent now in
Hindustan, its place perhaps is filled up by the practice of sodomy,
introduced since the Mahomedan period.]
CHAPTER X.
OF THE WAY HOW TO BEGIN AND HOW TO END THE CONGRESS.
DIFFERENT KINDS OF CONGRESS AND LOVE QUARRELS.
In the pleasure-room, decorated with flowers, and fragrant with
perfumes, attended by his friends and servants, the citizen should
receive the woman, who will come bathed and dressed, and will invite her
to take refreshment and to drink freely. He should then seat her on his
left side, and holding her hair, and touching also the end and knot of
her garment, he should gently embrace her with his right arm. They
should then carry on an amusing conversation on various subjects, and
may also talk suggestively of things which would be considered as
coarse, or not to be mentioned generally in society. They may then sing,
either with or without gesticulations, and play on musical instruments,
talk about the arts, and persuade each other to drink. At last when the
woman is overcome with love and desire, the citizen should dismiss the
people that may be with him, giving them flowers, ointment, and betel
leaves, and then when the two are left alone, they should proceed as has
been already described in the previous chapters.
Such is the beginning of sexual union. At the end of the congress, the
lovers with modesty, and not looking at each other, should go separately
to the washing-room. After this, sitting in their own places, they
should eat some betel leaves, and the citizen should apply with his own
hand to the body of the woman some pure sandal wood ointment, or
ointment of some other kind. He should then embrace her with his left
arm, and with agreeable words should cause her to drink from a cup held
in his own hand, or he may give her water to drink. They can then eat
sweetmeats, or anything else, according to their likings, and may drink
fresh juice,[40] soup, gruel, extracts of meat, sherbet, the juice of
mangoe fruits, the extract of the juice of the citron tree mixed with
sugar, or anything that may be liked in different countries, and known
to be sweet, soft, and pure. The lovers may also sit on the terrace of
the palace or house, and enjoy the moonlight, and carry on an agreeable
conversation. At this time, too, while the woman lies in his lap, with
her face towards the moon, the citizen should show her the different
planets, the morning star, the polar star, and the seven Rishis, or
Great Bear.
This is the end of sexual union.
Congress is of the following kinds, viz.:
Loving congress.
Congress of subsequent love.
Congress of artificial love.
Congress of transferred love.
Congress like that of eunuchs.
Deceitful congress.
Congress of spontaneous love.
(1). When a man and a woman, who have been in love with each other for
some time, come together with great difficulty, or when one of the two
returns from a journey, or is reconciled after having been separated on
account of a quarrel, then congress is called the loving congress. It
is carried on according to the liking of the lovers, and as long as they
choose.
(2). When two persons come together, while their love for each other is
still in its infancy, their congress is called the congress of
subsequent love.
(3). When a man carries on the congress by exciting himself by means of
the sixty-four ways, such as kissing, etc., etc., or when a man and a
woman come together, though in reality they are both attached to
different persons, their congress is then called congress of artificial
love. At this time all the ways and means mentioned in the Kama Shastra
should be used.
(4). When a man, from the beginning to the end of the congress, though
having connection with the women, thinks all the time that he is
enjoying another one whom he loves, it is called the congress of
transferred love.
(5). Congress between a man and a female water carrier, or a female
servant of a caste lower than his own, lasting only until the desire is
satisfied, is called congress like that of eunuchs. Here external
touches, kisses, and manipulations are not to be employed.
(6). The congress between a courtezan and a rustic, and that between
citizens and the women of villages, and bordering countries, is called,
deceitful congress.
(7). The congress that takes place between two persons who are attached
to one another, and which is done according to their own liking is
called spontaneous congress.
Thus ends the kinds of congress.
We shall now speak of love quarrels.
A woman who is very much in love with a man cannot bear to hear the name
of her rival mentioned, or to have any conversation regarding her, or to
be addressed by her name through mistake. If such takes place, a great
quarrel arises, and the woman cries, becomes angry, tosses her hair
about, strikes her lover, falls from her bed or seat, and, casting aside
her garlands and ornaments, throws herself down on the ground.
At this time, the lover should attempt to reconcile her with
conciliatory words, and should take her up carefully and place her on
her bed. But she, not replying to his questions, and with increased
anger, should bend down his head by pulling his hair, and having kicked
him once, twice, or thrice on his arms, head, bosom or back, should then
proceed to the door of the room. Dattaka says that she should then sit
angrily near the door and shed tears, but should not go out, because she
would be found fault with for going away. After a time, when she thinks
that the conciliatory words and actions of her lover have reached their
utmost, she should then embrace him, talking to him with harsh and
reproachful words, but at the same time showing a loving desire for
congress.
When the woman is in her own house, and has quarrelled with her lover,
she should go to him and show how angry she is, and leave him.
Afterwards the citizen having sent the Vita,[41] the Vidushaka[41] or
the Pithamurda[41] to pacify her, she should accompany them back to the
house, and spend the night with her lover.
Thus end the love quarrels.
In conclusion.
A man, employing the sixty-four means mentioned by Babhravya, obtains
his object, and enjoys the woman of the first quality. Though he may
speak well on other subjects, if he does not know the sixty-four
divisions, no great respect is paid to him in the assembly of the
learned. A man, devoid of other knowledge, but well acquainted with the
sixty-four divisions, becomes a leader in any society of men and women.
What man will not respect the sixty-four parts,[42] considering they are
respected by the learned, by the cunning, and by the courtezans. As the
sixty-four parts are respected, are charming, and add to the talent of
women, they are called by the Acharyas dear to women. A man skilled in
the sixty-four parts is looked upon with love by his own wife, by the
wives of others, and by courtezans.

PART III.
ABOUT THE ACQUISITION OF A WIFE.
CHAPTER I.
ON MARRIAGE.
When a girl of the same caste, and a virgin, is married in accordance
with the precepts of Holy Writ, the results of such an union are: the
acquisition of Dharma and Artha, offspring, affinity, increase of
friends, and untarnished love. For this reason a man should fix his
affections upon a girl who is of good family, whose parents are alive,
and who is three years or more younger than himself. She should be born
of a highly respectable family, possessed of wealth, well connected, and
with many relations and friends. She should also be beautiful, of a good
disposition, with lucky marks on her body, and with good hair, nails,
teeth, ears, eyes, and breasts, neither more nor less than they ought to
be, and no one of them entirely wanting, and not troubled with a sickly
body. The man should, of course, also possess these qualities himself.
But at all events, says Ghotakamukha, a girl who has been already joined
with others (_i.e._, no longer a maiden) should never be loved, for it
would be reproachable to do such a thing.
Now in order to bring about a marriage with such a girl as described
above, the parents and relations of the man should exert themselves, as
also such friends on both sides as may be desired to assist in the
matter. These friends should bring to the notice of the girl's parents,
the faults, both present and future, of all the other men that may wish
to marry her, and should at the same time extol even to exaggeration
all the excellencies, ancestral, and paternal, of their friend, so as to
endear him to them, and particularly to those that may be liked by the
girl's mother. One of the friends should also disguise himself as an
astrologer and declare the future good fortune and wealth of his friend
by showing the existence of all the lucky omens[43] and signs,[44] the
good influence of planets, the auspicious entrance of the sun into a
sign of the Zodiac, propitious stars and fortunate marks on his body.
Others again should rouse the jealousy of the girl's mother by telling
her that their friend has a chance of getting from some other quarter
even a better girl than hers.
A girl should be taken as a wife, as also given in marriage, when
fortune, signs, omens, and the words[45] of others are favourable, for,
says Ghotakamukha, a man should not marry at any time he likes. A girl
who is asleep, crying, or gone out of the house when sought in marriage,
or who is betrothed to another, should not be married. The following
also should be avoided:
One who is kept concealed.
One who has an ill-sounding name.
One who has her nose depressed.
One who has her nostril turned up.
One who is formed like a male.
One who is bent down.
One who has crooked thighs.
One who has a projecting forehead.
One who has a bald head.
One who does not like purity.
One who has been polluted by another.
One who is afflicted with the Gulma.[46]
One who is disfigured in any way.
One who has fully arrived at puberty.
One who is a friend.
One who is a younger sister.
One who is a Varshakari.[47]
In the same way a girl who is called by the name of one of the
twenty-seven stars, or by the name of a tree, or of a river, is
considered worthless, as also a girl whose name ends in r or l. But
some authors say that prosperity is gained only by marrying that girl to
whom one becomes attached, and that therefore no other girl but the one
who is loved should be married by anyone.
When a girl becomes marriageable her parents should dress her smartly,
and should place her where she can be easily seen by all. Every
afternoon, having dressed her and decorated her in a becoming manner,
they should send her with her female companions to sports, sacrifices,
and marriage ceremonies, and thus show her to advantage in society,
because she is a kind of merchandise. They should also receive with kind
words and signs of friendliness those of an auspicious appearance who
may come accompanied by their friends and relations for the purpose of
marrying their daughter, and under some pretext or other having first
dressed her becomingly, should then present her to them. After this they
should await the pleasure of fortune, and with this object should
appoint a future day on which a determination could be come to with
regard to their daughter's marriage. On this occasion when the persons
have come, the parents of the girl should ask them to bathe and dine,
and should say, Everything will take place at the proper time, and
should not then comply with the request, but should settle the matter
later.
When a girl is thus acquired, either according to the custom of the
country, or according to his own desire, the man should marry her in
accordance with the precepts of the Holy Writ, according to one of the
four kinds of marriage.
Thus ends marriage.
There are also some verses on the subject as follows:--
Amusement in society, such as completing verses begun by others,
marriages, and auspicious ceremonies should be carried on neither with
superiors, nor inferiors, but with our equals. That should be known as a
high connection when a man, after marrying a girl, has to serve her and
her relations afterwards like a servant, and such a connection is
censured by the good. On the other hand, that reproachable connection,
where a man, together with his relations, lords it over his wife, is
called a low connection by the wise. But when both the man and the woman
afford mutual pleasure to each other, and when the relatives on both
sides pay respect to one another, such is called a connection in the
proper sense of the word. Therefore a man should contract neither a high
connection by which he is obliged to bow down afterwards to his kinsmen,
nor a low connection, which is universally reprehended by all.

undertaking.]

CHAPTER II.
OF CREATING CONFIDENCE IN THE GIRL.
For the first three days after marriage, the girl and her husband should
sleep on the floor, abstain from sexual pleasures, and eat their food
without seasoning it either with alkali or salt. For the next seven days
they should bathe amidst the sounds of auspicious musical instruments,
should decorate themselves, dine together, and pay attention to their
relations as well as to those who may have come to witness their
marriage. This is applicable to persons of all castes. On the night of
the tenth day the man should begin in a lonely place with soft words,
and thus create confidence in the girl. Some authors say that for the
purpose of winning her over he should not speak to her for three days,
but the followers of Babhravya are of opinion that if the man does not
speak with her for three days, the girl may be discouraged by seeing him
spiritless like a pillar, and, becoming dejected, she may begin to
despise him as an eunuch. Vatsyayana says that the man should begin to
win her over, and to create confidence in her, but should abstain at
first from sexual pleasures. Women being of a tender nature, want tender
beginnings, and when they are forcibly approached by men with whom they
are but slightly acquainted, they sometimes suddenly become haters of
sexual connection, and sometimes even haters of the male sex. The man
should therefore approach the girl according to her liking, and should
make use of those devices by which he may be able to establish himself
more and more into her confidence. These devices are as follows:--
He should embrace her first of all in a way she likes most, because it
does not last for a long time.
He should embrace her with the upper part of his body because that is
easier and simpler. If the girl is grown up, or if the man has known
her for some time, he may embrace her by the light of a lamp, but if he
is not well acquainted with her, or if she is a young girl, he should
then embrace her in darkness.
When the girl accepts the embrace, the man should put a tambula or
screw of betel nut and betel leaves in her mouth, and if she will not
take it, he should induce her to do so by conciliatory words,
entreaties, oaths, and kneeling at her feet, for it is an universal rule
that however bashful or angry a woman may be, she never disregards a man
kneeling at her feet. At the time of giving this tambula he should
kiss her mouth softly and gracefully without making any sound. When she
is gained over in this respect he should then make her talk, and so that
she may be induced to talk he should ask her questions about things of
which he knows or pretends to know nothing, and which can be answered in
a few words. If she does not speak to him, he should not frighten her,
but should ask her the same thing again and again in a conciliatory
manner. If she does not then speak he should urge her to give a reply,
because as Ghotakamukha says, all girls hear everything said to them by
men, but do not themselves sometimes say a single word. When she is
thus importuned, the girl should give replies by shakes of the head, but
if she quarrelled with the man she should not even do that. When she is
asked by the man whether she wishes for him, and whether she likes him,
she should remain silent for a long time, and when at last importuned to
reply, should give him a favourable answer by a nod of the head. If the
man is previously acquainted with the girl he should converse with her
by means of a female friend, who may be favourable to him, and in the
confidence of both, and carry on the conversation on both sides. On such
an occasion the girl should smile with her head bent down, and if the
female friend say more on her part than she was desired to do, she
should chide her and dispute with her. The female friend should say in
jest even what she is not desired to say by the girl, and add, she says
so, on which the girl should say indistinctly and prettily, O no! I
did not say so, and she should then smile and throw an occasional
glance towards the man.
If the girl is familiar with the man, she should place near him,
without saying anything, the tambula, the ointment, or the garland that
he may have asked for, or she may tie them up in his upper garment.
While she is engaged in this, the man should touch her young breasts in
the sounding way of pressing with the nails, and if she prevents him
doing this he should say to her, I will not do it again if you will
embrace me, and should in this way cause her to embrace him. While he
is being embraced by her he should pass his hand repeatedly over and
about her body. By and bye he should place her in his lap, and try more
and more to gain her consent, and if she will not yield to him he should
frighten her by saying, I shall impress marks of my teeth and nails on
your lips and breasts, and then make similar marks on my own body, and
shall tell my friends that you did them. What will you say then? In
this and other ways, as fear and confidence are created in the minds of
children, so should the man gain her over to his wishes.
On the second and third nights, after her confidence has increased still
more, he should feel the whole of her body with his hands, and kiss her
all over; he should also place his hands upon her thighs and shampoo
them, and if he succeed in this he should then shampoo the joints of her
thighs. If she tries to prevent him doing this he should say to her,
What harm is there in doing it? and should persuade her to let him do
it. After gaining this point he should touch her private parts, should
loosen her girdle and the knot of her dress, and turning up her lower
garment should shampoo the joints of her naked thighs. Under various
pretences he should do all these things, but he should not at that time
begin actual congress. After this he should teach her the sixty-four
arts, should tell her how much he loves her, and describe to her the
hopes which he formerly entertained regarding her. He should also
promise to be faithful to her in future, and should dispel all her fears
with respect to rival women, and, at last, after having overcome her
bashfulness, he should begin to enjoy her in a way so as not to frighten
her. So much about creating confidence in the girl; and there are,
moreover, some verses on the subject as follows:--
A man acting according to the inclinations of a girl should try and gain
her over so that she may love him and place her confidence in him. A
man does not succeed either by implicitly following the inclination of a
girl, or by wholly opposing her, and he should therefore adopt a middle
course. He who knows how to make himself beloved by women, as well as to
increase their honour and create confidence in them, this man becomes an
object of their love. But he, who neglects a girl thinking she is too
bashful, is despised by her as a beast ignorant of the working of the
female mind. Moreover, a girl forcibly enjoyed by one who does not
understand the hearts of girls becomes nervous, uneasy, and dejected,
and suddenly begins to hate the man who has taken advantage of her; and
then, when her love is not understood or returned, she sinks into
despondency, and becomes either a hater of mankind altogether, or,
hating her own man, she has recourse to other men.[48]
FOOTNOTE:
[Footnote 48: These last few lines have been exemplified in many ways in
many novels of this century.]
CHAPTER III.
ON COURTSHIP, AND THE MANIFESTATION OF THE FEELINGS BY OUTWARD SIGNS AND
DEEDS.
A poor man possessed of good qualities, a man born of a low family
possessed of mediocre qualities, a neighbour possessed of wealth, and
one under the control of his father, mother or brothers, should not
marry without endeavouring to gain over the girl from her childhood to
love and esteem them. Thus a boy separated from his parents, and living
in the house of his uncle, should try to gain over the daughter of his
uncle, or some other girl, even though she be previously betrothed to
another. And this way of gaining over a girl, says Ghotakamukha, is
unexceptional, because Dharma can be accomplished by means of it, as
well as by any other way of marriage.
When a boy has thus begun to woo the girl he loves, he should spend his
time with her and amuse her with various games and diversions fitted for
their age and acquaintanceship, such as picking and collecting flowers,
making garlands of flowers, playing the parts of members of a fictitious
family, cooking food, playing with dice, playing with cards, the game of
odd and even, the game of finding out the middle finger, the game of six
pebbles, and such other games as may be prevalent in the country, and
agreeable to the disposition of the girl. In addition to this, he should
carry on various amusing games played by several persons together, such
as hide and seek, playing with seeds, hiding things in several small
heaps of wheat and looking for them, blind-man's buff, gymnastic
exercises, and other games of the same sort, in company with the girl,
her friends and female attendants. The man should also show great
kindness to any woman whom the girl thinks fit to be trusted, and should
also make new acquaintances, but above all he should attach to himself
by kindness and little services the daughter of the girl's nurse, for
if she be gained over, even though she comes to know of his design, she
does not cause any obstruction, but is sometimes even able to effect an
union between him and the girl. And though she knows the true character
of the man, she always talks of his many excellent qualities to the
parents and relations of the girl, even though she may not be desired to
do so by him.
In this way the man should do whatever the girl takes most delight in,
and he should get for her whatever she may have a desire to possess.
Thus he should procure for her such playthings as may be hardly known to
other girls. He may also show her a ball dyed with various colours, and
other curiosities of the same sort; and should give her dolls made of
cloth, wood, buffalo-horn, ivory, wax, flour, or earth; also utensils
for cooking food, and figures in wood, such as a man and woman standing,
a pair of rams, or goats, or sheep; also temples made of earth, bamboo,
or wood, dedicated to various goddesses; and cages for parrots, cuckoos,
starlings, quails, cocks, and partridges; water-vessels of different
sorts and of elegant forms, machines for throwing water about, guitars,
stands for putting images upon, stools, lac, red arsenic, yellow
ointment, vermilion and collyrium, as well as sandal-wood, saffron,
betel nut and betel leaves. Such things should be given at different
times whenever he gets a good opportunity of meeting her, and some of
them should be given in private, and some in public, according to
circumstances. In short, he should try in every way to make her look
upon him as one who would do for her everything that she wanted to be
done.
In the next place he should get her to meet him in some place privately,
and should then tell her that the reason of his giving presents to her
in secret was the fear that the parents of both of them might be
displeased, and then he may add that the things which he had given her
had been much desired by other people. When her love begins to show
signs of increasing he should relate to her agreeable stories if she
expresses a wish to hear such narratives. Or if she takes delight in
legerdemain, he should amaze her by performing various tricks of
jugglery; or if she feels a great curiosity to see a performance of the
various arts, he should show his own skill in them. When she is
delighted with singing he should entertain her with music, and on
certain days, and at the time of going together to moonlight fairs and
festivals, and at the time of her return after being absent from home,
he should present her with bouquets of flowers, and with chaplets for
the head, and with ear ornaments and rings, for these are the proper
occasions on which such things should be presented.
He should also teach the daughter of the girl's nurse all the sixty-four
means of pleasure practised by men, and under this pretext should also
inform her of his great skill in the art of sexual enjoyment. All this
time he should wear a fine dress, and make as good an appearance as
possible, for young women love men who live with them, and who are
handsome, good looking and well dressed. As for the saying that though
women may fall in love, they still make no effort themselves to gain
over the object of their affections, that is only a matter of idle talk.
Now a girl always shows her love by outward signs and actions, such as
the following:--She never looks the man in the face, and becomes abashed
when she is looked at by him; under some pretext or other she shows her
limbs to him; she looks secretly at him though he has gone away from her
side; hangs down her head when she is asked some question by him, and
answers in indistinct words and unfinished sentences, delights to be in
his company for a long time, speaks to her attendants in a peculiar tone
with the hope of attracting his attention towards her when she is at a
distance from him, does not wish to go from the place where he is, under
some pretext or other she makes him look at different things, narrates
to him tales and stories very slowly so that she may continue conversing
with him for a long time, kisses and embraces before him a child sitting
in her lap, draws ornamental marks on the foreheads of her female
servants, performs sportive and graceful movements when her attendants
speak jestingly to her in the presence of her lover, confides in her
lover's friends, and respects and obeys them, shows kindness to his
servants, converses with them, and engages them to do her work as if she
were their mistress, and listens attentively to them when they tell
stories about her lover to somebody else, enters his house when induced
to do so by the daughter of her nurse, and by her assistance manages to
converse and play with him, avoids being seen by her lover when she is
not dressed and decorated, gives him by the hand of her female friend
her ear ornament, ring, or garland of flowers that he may have asked to
see, always wears anything that he may have presented to her, become
dejected when any other bridegroom is mentioned by her parents, and does
not mix with those who may be of her party, or who may support his
claims.
There are also some verses on the subject as follows:--
A man, who has seen and perceived the feelings of the girl towards him,
and who has noticed the outward signs and movements by which those
feelings are expressed, should do everything in his power to effect an
union with her. He should gain over a young girl by childlike sports, a
damsel come of age by his skill in the arts, and a girl that loves him
by having recourse to persons in whom she confides.
CHAPTER IV.
ABOUT THINGS TO BE DONE ONLY BY THE MAN, AND THE ACQUISITION OF THE GIRL
THEREBY. ALSO WHAT IS TO BE DONE BY A GIRL TO GAIN OVER A MAN, AND
SUBJECT HIM TO HER.
Now when the girl begins to show her love by outward signs and motions,
as described in the last chapter, the lover should try to gain her over
entirely by various ways and means, such as the following:--
When engaged with her in any game or sport he should intentionally hold
her hand. He should practise upon her the various kinds of embraces,
such as the touching embrace, and others already described in a
preceeding chapter (Part II. Chapter 2). He should show her a pair of
human beings cut out of the leaf of a tree, and such like things, at
intervals. When engaged in water sports, he should dive at a distance
from her, and come up close to her. He should show an increased liking
for the new foliage of trees and such like things. He should describe to
her the pangs he suffers on her account. He should relate to her the
beautiful dream that he has had with reference to other women. At
parties and assemblies of his caste he should sit near her, and touch
her under some pretence or other, and having placed his foot upon her's,
he should slowly touch each of her toes, and press the ends of the
nails; if successful in this, he should get hold of her foot with his
hand and repeat the same thing. He should also press a finger of her
hand between his toes when she happens to be washing his feet; and
whenever he gives anything to her or takes anything from her, he should
show her by his manner and look how much he loves her.
He should sprinkle upon her the water brought for rinsing his mouth; and
when alone with her in a lonely place, or in darkness, he should make
love to her, and tell her the true state of his mind without distressing
her in any way.
Whenever he sits with her on the same seat or bed he should say to her,
I have something to tell you in private, and then, when she comes to
hear it in a quiet place, he should express his love to her more by
manner and signs than by words. When he comes to know the state of her
feelings towards him he should pretend to be ill, and should make her
come to his house to speak to him. There he should intentionally hold
her hand and place it on his eyes and forehead, and under the pretence
of preparing some medicine for him he should ask her to do work for his
sake in the following words: This work must be done by you, and by
nobody else. When she wants to go away he should let her go, with an
earnest request to come and see him again. This device of illness should
be continued for three days and three nights. After this, when she
begins coming to see him frequently, he should carry on long
conversations with her, for, says Ghotakamukha, though a man loves a
girl ever so much, he never succeeds in winning her without a great deal
of talking. At last, when the man finds the girl completely gained
over, he may then begin to enjoy her. As for the saying that women grow
less timid than usual during the evening, and in darkness, and are
desirous of congress at those times, and do not oppose men then and
should only be enjoyed at these hours, it is a matter of talk only.
When it is impossible for the man to carry on his endeavours alone, he
should, by means of the daughter of her nurse, or of a female friend in
whom she confides, cause the girl to be brought to him without making
known to her his design, and he should then proceed with her in the
manner above described. Or he should in the beginning send his own
female servant to live with the girl as her friend, and should then gain
her over by her means.
At last, when he knows the state of her feelings by her outward manner
and conduct towards him at religious ceremonies, marriage ceremonies,
fairs, festivals, theatres, public assemblies, and such like occasions,
he should begin to enjoy her when she is alone, for Vatsyayana lays it
down, that women, when resorted to at proper times and in proper
places, do not turn away from their lovers.
When a girl, possessed of good qualities and well-bred, though born in a
humble family, or destitute of wealth, and not therefore desired by her
equals, or an orphan girl, or one deprived of her parents, but observing
the rules of her family and caste, should wish to bring about her own
marriage when she comes of age, such a girl should endeavour to gain
over a strong and good looking young man, or a person whom she thinks
would marry her on account of the weakness of his mind, and even without
the consent of his parents. She should do this by such means as would
endear her to the said person, as well as by frequently seeing and
meeting him. Her mother also should constantly cause them to meet by
means of her female friends, and the daughter of her nurse. The girl
herself should try to get alone with her beloved in some quiet place,
and at odd times should give him flowers, betel nut, betel leaves and
perfumes. She should also show her skill in the practice of the arts, in
shampooing, in scratching and in pressing with the nails. She should
also talk to him on the subjects he likes best, and discuss with him the
ways and means of gaining over and winning the affections of a girl.
But old authors say that although the girl loves the man ever so much,
she should not offer herself, or make the first overtures, for a girl
who does this loses her dignity, and is liable to be scorned and
rejected. But when the man shows his wish to enjoy her, she should be
favourable to him and should show no change in her demeanour when he
embraces her, and should receive all the manifestations of his love as
if she were ignorant of the state of his mind. But when he tries to kiss
her she should oppose him; when he begs to be allowed to have sexual
intercourse with her she should let him touch her private parts only and
with considerable difficulty; and though importuned by him, she should
not yield herself up to him as if of her own accord, but should resists
his attempts to have her. It is only, moreover, when she is certain that
she is truly loved, and that her lover is indeed devoted to her, and
will not change his mind, that she should then give herself up to him,
and persuade him to marry her quickly. After losing her virginity she
should tell her confidential friends about it.
Here ends the efforts of a girl to gain over a man.
There are also some verses on the subject as follows: A girl who is much
sought after should marry the man that she likes, and whom she thinks
would be obedient to her, and capable of giving her pleasure. But when
from the desire of wealth a girl is married by her parents to a rich man
without taking into consideration the character or looks of the
bridegroom, or when given to a man who has several wives, she never
becomes attached to the man, even though he be endowed with good
qualities, obedient to her will, active, strong, and healthy, and
anxious to please her in every way.[49] A husband who is obedient but
yet master of himself, though he be poor and not good looking, is better
than one who is common to many women, even though he be handsome and
attractive. The wives of rich men, where there are many wives, are not
generally attached to their husbands, and are not confidential with
them, and even though they possess all the external enjoyments of life,
still have recourse to other men. A man who is of a low mind, who has
fallen from his social position, and who is much given to travelling,
does not deserve to be married; neither does one who has many wives and
children, or one who is devoted to sport and gambling, and who comes to
his wife only when he likes. Of all the lovers of a girl he only is her
true husband who possesses the qualities that are liked by her, and such
a husband only enjoys real superiority over her, because he is the
husband of love.
FOOTNOTE:
[Footnote 49: There is a good deal of truth in the last few
observations. Woman is a monogamous animal, and loves but one, and likes
to feel herself alone in the affections of one man, and cannot bear
rivals. It may also be taken as a general rule that women either married
to, or kept by, rich men love them for their wealth, but not for
themselves.]
CHAPTER V.
ON CERTAIN FORMS OF MARRIAGE[50]
When a girl cannot meet her lover frequently in private, she should send
the daughter of her nurse to him, it being understood that she has
confidence in her, and had previously gained her over to her interests.
On seeing the man, the daughter of the nurse should, in the course of
conversation, describe to him the noble birth, the good disposition, the
beauty, talent, skill, knowledge of human nature and affection of the
girl in such a way as not to let him suppose that she has been sent by
the girl, and should thus create affection for the girl in the heart of
the man. To the girl also she should speak about the excellent qualities
of the man, especially of those qualities which she knows are pleasing
to the girl. She should, moreover, speak with disparagement of the other
lovers of the girl, and talk about the avarice and indiscretion of their
parents, and the fickleness of their relations. She should also quote
samples of many girls of ancient times, such as Sakuntala and others,
who, having united themselves with lovers of their own caste and their
own choice, were ever happy afterwards in their society. And she should
also tell of other girls who married into great families, and being
troubled by rival wives, became wretched and miserable, and were finally
abandoned. She should further speak of the good fortune, the continual
happiness, the chastity, obedience, and affection of the man, and if the
girl gets amorous about him, she should endeavour to allay her shame[51]
and her fear as well as her suspicions about any disaster that might
result from the marriage. In a word, she should act the whole part of a
female messenger by telling the girl all about the man's affection for
her, the places he frequented, and the endeavours he made to meet her,
and by frequently repeating, It will be all right if the man will take
you away forcibly and unexpectedly.
_The Forms of Marriage._
When the girl is gained over, and acts openly with the man as his wife,
he should cause fire to be brought from the house of a Brahman, and
having spread the Kusha grass upon the ground, and offered an oblation
to the fire he should marry her according to the precepts of the
religious law. After this he should inform his parents of the fact,
because it is the opinion of ancient authors that a marriage solemnly
contracted in the presence of fire cannot afterwards be set aside.
After the consummation of the marriage, the relations of the man should
gradually be made acquainted with the affair, and the relations of the
girl should also be apprised of it in such a way that they may consent
to the marriage, and overlook the manner in which it was brought about,
and when this is done they should afterwards be reconciled by
affectionate presents and favourable conduct. In this manner the man
should marry the girl according to the Gandharva form of marriage.
When the girl cannot make up her mind, or will not express her readiness
to marry, the man should obtain her in any one of the following ways:--
(1). On a fitting occasion, and under some excuse, he should by means of
a female friend with whom he is well acquainted, and whom he can trust,
and who also is well known to the girl's family, get the girl brought
unexpectedly to his house, and he should then bring fire from the house
of a Brahman, and proceed as before described.
(2.) When the marriage of the girl with some other person draws near,
the man should disparage the future husband to the utmost in the mind of
the mother of the girl, and then having got the girl to come with her
mother's consent to a neighbouring house, he should bring fire from the
house of a Brahman, and proceed as above.
(3.) The man should become a great friend of the brother of the girl,
the said brother being of the same age as himself, and addicted to
courtesans, and to intrigues with the wives of other people, and should
give him assistance in such matters, and also give him occasional
presents. He should then tell him about his great love for his sister,
as young men will sacrifice even their lives for the sake of those who
may be of the same age, habits, and dispositions as themselves. After
this the man should get the girl brought by means of her brother to some
secure place, and having brought fire from the house of a Brahman,
should proceed as before.
(4.) The man should on the occasion of festivals get the daughter of the
nurse to give the girl some intoxicating substance, and then cause her
to be brought to some secure place under the pretence of some business,
and there having enjoyed her before she recovers from her intoxication,
should bring fire from the house of a Brahman, and proceed as before.
(5.) The man should, with the connivance of the daughter of the nurse,
carry off the girl from her house while she is asleep, and then, having
enjoyed her before she recovers from her sleep, should bring fire from
the house of a Brahman, and proceed as before.
(6.) When the girl goes to a garden, or to some village in the
neighbourhood, the man should, with his friends, fall on her guards, and
having killed them, or frightened them away, forcibly carry her off, and
proceed as before.
There are verses on the subject as follows:--In all the forms of
marriage given in this chapter of this work, the one that precedes is
better than the one that follows it, on account of its being more in
accordance with the commands of religion, and therefore it is only when
it is impossible to carry the former into practice that the latter
should be resorted to. As the fruit of all good marriages is love, the
Gandharva[52] form of marriage is respected, even though it is formed
under unfavourable circumstances, because it fulfils the object sought
for. Another cause of the respect accorded to the Gandharva form of
marriage is, that it brings forth happiness, causes less trouble in its
performance than any other forms of marriage, and is above all the
result of previous love.
FOOTNOTE:
[Footnote 50: These forms of marriage differ from the four kinds of
marriage mentioned in Chapter I., and are only to be made use of when
the girl is gained over in the way mentioned in Chapters III. and IV.]

page 114 of Early Ideas; a Group of Hindoo Stories, collected and

matrimony was recognised by the ancient Hindus, and is frequent in
books. It is a kind of Scotch Wedding--ultra-Caledonian--taking place by
mutual consent without any form or ceremony. The Gandharvas are heavenly
minstrels of Indra's court, who are supposed to be witnesses.]
=END OF PART III.=
PART IV.
ABOUT A WIFE.
CHAPTER I.
ON THE MANNER OF LIVING OF A VIRTUOUS WOMAN, AND OF HER BEHAVIOUR DURING
THE ABSENCE OF HER HUSBAND.
A virtuous woman, who has affection for her husband, should act in
conformity with his wishes as if he were a divine being, and with his
consent should take upon herself the whole care of his family. She
should keep the whole house well cleaned, and arrange flowers of various
kinds in different parts of it, and make the floor smooth and polished
so as to give the whole a neat and becoming appearance. She should
surround the house with a garden, and place ready in it all the
materials required for the morning, noon and even sacrifices. Moreover
she should herself revere the sanctuary of the Household Gods, for says
Gonardiya, nothing so much attracts the heart of a householder to his
wife as a careful observance of the things mentioned above.
Towards the parents, relations, friends, sisters, and servants of her
husband she should behave as they deserve. In the garden she should
plant beds of green vegetables, bunches of the sugar cane, and clumps of
the fig tree, the mustard plant, the parsley plant, the fennel plant,
and the xanthochymus pictorius. Clusters of various flowers, such as the
trapa bispinosa, the jasmine, the gasminum grandiflorum, the yellow
amaranth, the wild jasmine, the tabernamontana coronaria, the
nadyaworta, the china rose and others, should likewise be planted,
together with the fragrant grass andropogon sch√¶nanthus, and the
fragrant root of the plant andropogon miricatus. She should also have
seats and arbours made in the garden, in the middle of which a well,
tank, or pool should be dug.
The wife should always avoid the company of female beggars, female
buddish mendicants, unchaste and roguish women, female fortune tellers
and witches. As regards meals she should always consider what her
husband likes and dislikes, and what things are good for him, and what
are injurious to him. When she hears the sounds of his footsteps coming
home she should at once get up, and be ready to do whatever he may
command her, and either order her female servant to wash his feet, or
wash them herself. When going anywhere with her husband, she should put
on her ornaments, and without his consent she should not either give or
accept invitations, or attend marriages and sacrifices, or sit in the
company of female friends, or visit the temples of the Gods. And if she
wants to engage in any kind of games or sports, she should not do it
against his will. In the same way she should always sit down after him,
and get up before him, and should never awaken him when he is asleep.
The kitchen should be situated in a quiet and retired place, so as not
to be accessible to strangers, and should always look clean.
In the event of any misconduct on the part of her husband, she should
not blame him excessively though she be a little displeased. She should
not use abusive language towards him, but rebuke him with conciliatory
words, whether he be in the company of friends or alone. Moreover, she
should not be a scold, for says Gonardiya, there is no cause of dislike
on the part of a husband so great as this characteristic in a wife.
Lastly she should avoid bad expressions, sulky looks, speaking aside,
standing in the doorway, and looking at passers-by, conversing in the
pleasure groves, and remaining in a lonely place for a long time; and
finally she should always keep her body, her teeth, her hair, and
everything belonging to her tidy, sweet, and clean.
When the wife wants to approach her husband in private her dress should
consist of many ornaments, various kinds of flowers, and a cloth
decorated with different colours, and some sweet-smelling ointments or
unguents. But her every-day dress should be composed of a thin,
close-textured cloth, a few ornaments and flowers, and a little scent,
not too much. She should also observe the fasts and vows of her husband,
and when he tries to prevent her doing this, she should persuade him to
let her do it.
At appropriate times of the year, and when they happen to be cheap, she
should buy earth, bamboos, firewood, skins, and iron pots, as also salt
and oil. Fragrant substances, vessels made of the fruit of the plant
wrightea antidysenterica, or oval leaved wrightea, medicines, and other
things which are always wanted, should be obtained when required and
kept in a secret place of the house. The seeds of the radish, the
potato, the common beet, the Indian wormwood, the mangoe, the cucumber,
the egg plant, the kushmanda, the pumpkin gourd, the surana, the
bignonia indica, the sandal wood, the premna spinosa, the garlic plant,
the onion, and other vegetables, should be bought and sown at the proper
seasons.
The wife, moreover, should not tell to strangers the amount of her
wealth, nor the secrets which her husband has confided to her. She
should surpass all the women of her own rank in life in her cleverness,
her appearance, her knowledge of cookery, her pride, and her manner of
serving her husband. The expenditure of the year should be regulated by
the profits. The milk that remains after the meals should be turned into
ghee or clarified butter. Oil and sugar should be prepared at home;
spinning and weaving should also be done there; and a store of ropes and
cords, and barks of trees for twisting into ropes should be kept. She
should also attend to the pounding and cleaning of rice, using its small
grain and chaff in some way or other. She should pay the salaries of the
servants, look after the tilling of the fields, and keeping of the
flocks and herds, superintend the making of vehicles, and take care of
the rams, cocks, quails, parrots, starlings, cuckoos, peacocks, monkeys,
and deer; and finally adjust the income and expenditure of the day. The
worn-out clothes should be given to those servants who have done good
work, in order to show them that their services have been appreciated,
or they may be applied to some other use. The vessels in which wine is
prepared, as well as those in which it is kept, should be carefully
looked after, and put away at the proper time. All sales and purchases
should also be well attended to. The friends of her husband she should
welcome by presenting them with flowers, ointment, incense, betel
leaves, and betel nut. Her father-in-law and mother-in law she should
treat as they deserve, always remaining dependant on their will, never
contradicting them, speaking to them in few and not harsh words, not
laughing loudly in their presence, and acting with their friends and
enemies as with her own. In addition to the above she should not be
vain, or too much taken up with her enjoyments. She should be liberal
towards her servants, and reward them on holidays and festivals; and not
give away anything without first making it known to her husband.
Thus ends the manner of living of a virtuous woman.
During the absence of her husband on a journey the virtuous woman should
wear only her auspicious ornaments, and observe the fasts in honour of
the Gods. While anxious to hear the news of her husband, she should
still look after her household affairs. She should sleep near the elder
women of the house, and make herself agreeable to them. She should look
after and keep in repair the things that are liked by her husband, and
continue the works that have been begun by him. To the abode of her
relations she should not go except on occasions of joy and sorrow, and
then she should go in her usual travelling dress, accompanied by her
husband's servants, and not remain there for a long time. The fasts and
feasts should be observed with the consent of the elders of the house.
The resources should be increased by making purchases and sales
according to the practice of the merchants, and by means of honest
servants, superintended by herself. The income should be increased, and
the expenditure diminished as much as possible. And when her husband
returns from his journey, she should receive him at first in her
ordinary clothes, so that he may know in what way she has lived during
his absence, and should bring to him some presents, as also materials
for the worship of the Deity.
Thus ends the part relating to the behaviour of a wife during the
absence of her husband on a journey.
There are also some verses on the subject as follows.
The wife, whether she be a woman of noble family, or a virgin widow[53]
re-married, or a concubine, should lead a chaste life, devoted to her
husband, and doing every thing for his welfare. Women acting thus,
acquire Dharma, Artha, and Kama, obtain a high position, and generally
keep their husbands devoted to them.
FOOTNOTE:
[Footnote 53: This probably refers to a girl married in her infancy, or
when very young, and whose husband had died before she arrived at the
age of puberty. Infant marriages are still the common custom of the
Hindoos.]
CHAPTER II.
ON THE CONDUCT OF THE ELDER WIFE TOWARDS THE OTHER WIVES OF HER HUSBAND,
AND ON THAT OF A YOUNGER WIFE TOWARDS THE ELDER ONES. ALSO ON THE
CONDUCT OF A VIRGIN WIDOW RE-MARRIED; OF A WIFE DISLIKED BY HER HUSBAND;
OF THE WOMEN IN THE KING'S HAREM; AND LASTLY ON THE CONDUCT OF A HUSBAND
TOWARDS MANY WIVES.
The causes of re-marrying during the lifetime of the wife are as
follows:
(1). The folly or ill temper of the wife.
(2). Her husband's dislike to her.
(3). The want of offspring.
(4). The continual birth of daughters.
(5). The incontinence of the husband.
From the very beginning the wife should endeavour to attract the heart
of her husband, by showing to him continually her devotion, her good
temper, and her wisdom. If however she bears him no children, she should
herself tell her husband to marry another woman. And when the second
wife is married, and brought to the house, the first wife should give
her a position superior to her own, and look upon her as a sister. In
the morning the elder wife should forcibly make the younger one decorate
herself in the presence of their husband, and should not mind all the
husband's favour being given to her. If the younger wife does anything
to displease her husband the elder one should not neglect her, but
should always be ready to give her most careful advice, and should teach
her to do various things in the presence of her husband. Her children
she should treat as her own, her attendants she should look upon with
more regard, even than on her own servants, her friends she should
cherish with love and kindness, and her relations with great honour.
When there are many other wives besides herself, the elder wife should
associate with the one who is immediately next to her in rank and age,
and should instigate the wife who has recently enjoyed her husband's
favour to quarrel with the present favourite. After this she should
sympathize with the former, and having collected all the other wives
together, should get them to denounce the favourite as a scheming and
wicked woman, without however committing herself in any way. If the
favourite wife happens to quarrel with the husband, then the elder wife
should take her part and give her false encouragement, and thus cause
the quarrel to be increased. If there be only a little quarrel between
the two, the elder wife should do all she can to work it up into a large
quarrel. But if after all this she finds the husband still continues to
love his favourite wife she should then change her tactics, and
endeavour to bring about a conciliation between them, so as to avoid her
husband's displeasure.
Thus ends the conduct of the elder wife.
The younger wife should regard the elder wife of her husband as her
mother, and should not give anything away, even to her own relations,
without her knowledge. She should tell her everything about herself, and
not approach her husband without her permission. Whatever is told to her
by the elder wife she should not reveal to others, and she should take
care of the children of the senior even more than of her own. When alone
with her husband she should serve him well, but should not tell him of
the pain she suffers from the existence of a rival wife. She may also
obtain secretly from her husband some marks of his particular regard for
her, and may tell him that she lives only for him, and for the regard
that he has for her. She should never reveal her love for her husband,
nor her husband's love for her to any person, either in pride or in
anger, for a wife that reveals the secrets of her husband is despised by
him. As for seeking to obtain the regard of her husband, Gonardiya says,
that it should always be done in private, for fear of the elder wife. If
the elder wife be disliked by her husband, or be childless, she should
sympathize with her, and should ask her husband to do the same, but
should surpass her in leading the life of a chaste woman.
Thus ends the conduct of the younger wife towards the elder.
A widow in poor circumstances, or of a weak nature, and who allies
herself again to a man, is called a widow re-married.
The followers of Babhravya say that a virgin widow should not marry a
person whom she may be obliged to leave on account of his bad character,
or of his being destitute of the excellent qualities of a man, she thus
being obliged to have recourse to another person. Gonardya is of opinion
that as the cause of a widow's marrying again is her desire for
happiness, and as happiness is secured by the possession of excellent
qualities in her husband, joined to love of enjoyment, it is better
therefore to secure a person endowed with such qualities in the first
instance. Vatsyayana however thinks that a widow may marry any person
that she likes, and that she thinks will suit her.
At the time of her marriage the widow should obtain from her husband the
money to pay the cost of drinking parties, and picnics with her
relations, and of giving them and her friends kindly gifts and presents;
or she may do these things at her own cost if she likes. In the same way
she may wear either her husband's ornaments or her own. As to the
presents of affection mutually exchanged between the husband and herself
there is no fixed rule about them. If she leaves her husband after
marriage of her own accord, she should restore to him whatever he may
have given her, with the exception of the mutual presents. If however
she is driven out of the house by her husband she should not return
anything to him.
After her marriage she should live in the house of her husband like one
of the chief members of the family, but should treat the other ladies of
the family with kindness, the servants with generosity, and all the
friends of the house with familiarity and good temper. She should show
that she is better acquainted with the sixty-four arts than the other
ladies of the house, and in any quarrels with her husband she should not
rebuke him severely, but in private do everything that he wishes, and
make use of the sixty-four ways of enjoyment. She should be obliging to
the other wives of her husband, and to their children she should give
presents, behave as their mistress, and make ornaments and play things
for their use. In the friends and servants of her husband she should
confide more than in his other wives, and finally she should have a
liking for drinking parties, going to picnics, attending fairs and
festivals, and for carrying out all kinds of games and amusements.
Thus ends the conduct of a virgin widow re-married.
A woman who is disliked by her husband, and annoyed and distressed by
his other wives, should associate with the wife who is liked most by her
husband, and who serves him more than the others, and should teach her
all the arts with which she is acquainted. She should act as the nurse
of her husband's children, and having gained over his friends to her
side, should through them make him acquainted of her devotion to him. In
religious ceremonies she should be a leader, as also in vows and fasts,
and should not hold too good an opinion of herself. When her husband is
lying on his bed she should only go near him when it is agreeable to
him, and should never rebuke him, or show obstinacy in any way. If her
husband happens to quarrel with any of his other wives, she should
reconcile them to each other, and if he desires to see any woman
secretly, she should manage to bring about the meeting between them. She
should moreover make herself acquainted with the weak points of her
husband's character, but always keep them secret, and on the whole
behave herself in such an way as may lead him to look upon her as a good
and devoted wife.
Here ends the conduct of a wife disliked by her husband.
The above sections will show how all the women of the King's seraglio
are to behave, and therefore we shall now speak separately only about
the king.
The female attendants in the harem (called severally Kanchukiyas,[54]
Mahallarikas,[55] and Mahallikas,[56]) should bring flowers, ointments
and clothes from the King's wives to the King, and he having received
these things should give them as presents to the servants, along with
the things worn by him the previous day. In the afternoon the King,
having dressed and put on his ornaments, should interview the women of
the harem, who should also be dressed and decorated with jewels. Then
having given to each of them such a place and such respect as may suit
the occasion and as they may deserve, he should carry on with them a
cheerful conversation. After that he should see such of his wives as may
be virgin widows re-married, and after them the concubines and dancing
girls. All of these should be visited in their own private rooms.
When the King rises from his noonday sleep, the woman whose duty it is
to inform the King regarding the wife who is to spend the night with him
should come to him accompanied by the female attendants of that wife
whose turn may have arrived in the regular course, and of her who may
have been accidentally passed over as her turn arrived, and of her who
may have been unwell at the time of her turn. These attendants should
place before the King the ointments and unguents sent by each of these
wives, marked with the seal of her ring, and their names and their
reasons for sending the ointments should be told to the King. After this
the King accepts the ointment of one of them, who then is informed that
her ointment has been accepted, and that her day has been settled.[57]
At festivals, singing parties and exhibitions, all the wives of the King
should be treated with respect and served with drinks.
But the women of the harem should not be allowed to go out alone,
neither should any women outside the harem be allowed to enter it except
those whose character is well known. And lastly the work which the
King's wives have to do should not be too fatiguing.
Thus ends the conduct of the King towards the women of the harem, and of
their own conduct.
A man marrying many wives should act fairly towards them all. He should
neither disregard nor pass over their faults, and should not reveal to
one wife the love, passion, bodily blemishes, and confidential
reproaches of the other. No opportunity should be given to any one of
them of speaking to him about their rivals, and if one of them should
begin to speak ill of another, he should chide her and tell her that she
has exactly the same blemishes in her character. One of them he should
please by secret confidence, another by secret respect, and another by
secret flattery, and he should please them all by going to gardens, by
amusements, by presents, by honouring their relations, by telling them
secrets, and lastly by loving unions. A young woman who is of a good
temper, and who conducts herself according to the precepts of the Holy
Writ, wins her husband's attachment, and obtains a superiority over her
rivals.
Thus ends the conduct of a husband towards many wives.
FOOTNOTES:
[Footnote 54: A name given to the maid servants of the zenana of the
Kings in ancient times, on account of their always keeping their breasts
covered with a cloth called Kanchuki. It was customary in the olden time
for the maid servants to cover their breasts with a cloth, while the
Queens kept their breasts uncovered. This custom is distinctly to be
seen in the Ajunta cave paintings.]
[Footnote 55: The meaning of this word is a superior woman, so it would
seem that a Mahallarika must be a person in authority over the maid
servants of the house.]
[Footnote 56: This was also appertaining to the rank of women employed
in the harem. In latter times this place was given to eunuchs.]
[Footnote 57: As Kings generally had many wives, it was usual for them
to enjoy their wives by turns. But as it happened sometimes that some of
them lost their turns owing to the King's absence, or to their being
unwell, then in such cases the women whose turns had been passed over,
and those whose turns had come, used to have a sort of lottery, and the
ointment of all the claimants were sent to the King, who accepted the
ointment of one of them, and thus settled the question.]

PART V.
ABOUT THE WIVES OF OTHER MEN.
CHAPTER I.
OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF MEN AND WOMEN.--THE REASONS WHY WOMEN REJECT
THE ADDRESSES OF MEN.--ABOUT MEN WHO HAVE SUCCESS WITH WOMEN, AND ABOUT
WOMEN WHO ARE EASILY GAINED OVER.
The wives of other people may be resorted to on the occasions already
described in Part I., Chapter 5, of this work, but the possibility of
their acquisition, their fitness for cohabitation, the danger to oneself
in uniting with them, and the future effect of these unions, should
first of all be examined. A man may resort to the wife of another, for
the purpose of saving his own life, when he perceives that his love for
her proceeds from one degree of intensity to another. These degrees are
ten in number, and are distinguished by the following marks:
1. Love of the eye.
2. Attachment of the mind.
3. Constant reflection.
4. Destruction of sleep.
5. Emaciation of the body.
6. Turning away from objects of enjoyment.
7. Removal of shame.
8. Madness.
9. Fainting.
10. Death.
Ancient authors say that a man should know the disposition,
truthfulness, purity, and will of a young woman, as also the intensity,
or weakness of her passions, from the form of her body, and from her
characteristic marks and signs. But Vatsyayana is of opinion that the
forms of bodies, and the characteristic marks or signs are but erring
tests of character, and that women should be judged by their conduct, by
the outward expression of their thoughts, and by the movements of their
bodies.
Now as a general rule Gonikaputra says that a woman falls in love with
every handsome man she sees, and so does every man at the sight of a
beautiful woman, but frequently they do not take any further steps,
owing to various considerations. In love the following circumstances are
peculiar to the woman. She loves without regard to right or wrong,[58]
and does not try to gain over a man simply for the attainment of some
particular purpose. Moreover, when a man first makes up to her she
naturally shrinks from him, even though she may be willing to unite
herself with him. But when the attempts to gain her are repeated and
renewed, she at last consents. But with a man, even though he may have
begun to love, he conquers his feelings from a regard for morality and
wisdom, and although his thoughts are often on the woman, he does not
yield, even though an attempt be made to gain him over. He sometimes
makes an attempt or effort to win the object of his affections, and
having failed, he leaves her alone for the future. In the same way, when
a woman is once gained, he often becomes indifferent about her. As for
the saying that a man does not care for what is easily gained, and only
desires a thing which cannot be obtained without difficulty, it is only
a matter of talk.
The causes of a woman rejecting the addresses of a man are as follows:
1. Affection for her husband.
2. Desire of lawful progeny.
3. Want of opportunity.
4. Anger at being addressed by the man too familiarly.
5. Difference in rank of life.
6. Want of certainty on account of the man being devoted to travelling.
7. Thinking that the man may be attached to some other person.
8. Fear of the man's not keeping his intentions secret.
9. Thinking that the man is too devoted to his friends, and has too
great a regard for them.
10. The apprehension that he is not in earnest.
11. Bashfulness on account of his being an illustrious man.
12. Fear on account of his being powerful, or possessed of too impetuous
passion, in the case of the deer woman.
13. Bashfulness on account of his being too clever.
14. The thought of having once lived with him on friendly terms only.
15. Contempt of his want of knowledge of the world.
16. Distrust of his low character.
17. Disgust at his want of perception of her love for him.
18. In the case of an elephant woman, the thought that he is a hare man,
or a man of weak passion.
19. Compassion lest any thing should befall him on account of his
passion.
20. Despair at her own imperfections.
21. Fear of discovery.
22. Disillusion at seeing his grey hair or shabby appearance.
23. Fear that he may be employed by her husband to test her chastity.
24. The thought that he has too much regard for morality.
Whichever of the above causes a man may detect, he should endeavour to
remove it from the very beginning. Thus, the bashfulness that may arise
from his greatness or his ability, he should remove by showing his great
love and affection for her. The difficulty of the want of opportunity,
or if his inaccessibility, he should remove by showing her some easy way
of access. The excessive respect entertained by the woman for him should
be removed by making himself very familiar. The difficulties that arise
from his being thought a low character he should remove by showing his
valour and his wisdom; those that come from neglect by extra attention;
and those that arise from fear by giving her proper encouragement.
The following are the men who generally obtain success with women.
1. Men well versed in the science of love.
2. Men skilled in telling stories.

talents, and wisdom suitable to her own tastes.
25. A woman who is slighted by her husband without any cause.
26. A woman who is not respected by other women of the same rank or
beauty as herself.
27. A woman whose husband is devoted to travelling.

from which all danger is taken away by wisdom, becomes firm and secure.
A clever man, depending on his own ability, and observing carefully the
ideas and thoughts of women, and removing the causes of their turning
away from men, is generally successful with them.

CHAPTER II.
ABOUT MAKING ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE WOMAN, AND OF THE EFFORTS TO GAIN HER
OVER.
Ancient authors are of opinion that girls are not so easily seduced by
employing female messengers as by the efforts of the man himself, but
that the wives of others are more easily got at by the aid of female
messengers than by the personal efforts of a man. But Vatsyayana lays it
down that whenever it is possible a man should always act himself in
these matters, and it is only when such is impracticable, or impossible,
that female messengers should be employed. As for the saying that women
who act and talk boldly and freely are to be won by the personal efforts
of the man, and that women who do not possess those qualities are to be
got at by female messengers, it is only a matter of talk.
Now when a man acts himself in the matter he should first of all make
the acquaintance of the woman he loves in the following manner.
1st. He should arrange to be seen by the woman either on a natural or
special opportunity. A natural opportunity is when one of them goes to
the house of the other, and a special opportunity is when they meet
either at the house of a friend, or a caste-fellow, or a minister, or a
physician, as also on the occasion of marriage ceremonies, sacrifices,
festivals, funerals, and garden parties.
2nd. When they do meet, the man should be careful to look at her in such
a way as to cause the state of his mind to be made known to her; he
should pull about his moustache, make a sound with his nails, cause his
own ornaments to tinkle, bite his lower lip, and make various other
signs of that description. When she is looking at him he should speak
to his friends about her and other women, and should show to her his
liberality and his appreciation of enjoyments. When sitting by the side
of a female friend he should yawn and twist his body, contract his
eyebrows, speak very slowly as if he were weary, and listen to her
indifferently. A conversation having two meanings should also be carried
on with a child or some other person, apparently having regard to a
third person, but really having reference to the woman he loves, and in
this way his love should be made manifest under the pretext of referring
to others rather than to herself. He should make marks that have
reference to her, on the earth with his nails, or with a stick, and
should embrace and kiss a child in her presence, and give it the mixture
of betel nut and betel leaves with his tongue, and press its chin with
his fingers in a caressing way. All these things should be done at the
proper time and in proper places.
3rd. The man should fondle a child that may be sitting on her lap, and
give it something to play with, and also take the same back again.
Conversation with respect to the child may also be held with her, and in
this manner he should gradually become well acquainted with her, and he
should also make himself agreeable to her relations. Afterwards, this
acquaintance should be made a pretext for visiting her house frequently,
and on such occasions he should converse on the subject of love in her
absence, but within her hearing. As his intimacy with her increases he
should place in her charge some kind of deposit or trust, and take away
from it a small portion at a time; or he may give her some fragrant
substances, or betel nuts to be kept for him by her. After this he
should endeavour to make her well acquainted with his own wife, and get
them to carry on confidential conversations, and to sit together in
lonely places. In order to see her frequently he should arrange that the
same goldsmith, the same jeweller, the same basket maker, the same dyer,
and the same washerman should be employed by the two families. And he
should also pay her long visits openly under the pretence of being
engaged with her on business, and one business should lead to another,
so as to keep up the intercourse between them. Whenever she wants
anything, or is in need of money, or wishes to acquire skill in one of
the arts, he should cause her to understand that he is willing and able
to do anything that she wants, to give her money, or teach her one of
the arts, all these things being quite within his ability and power. In
the same way he should hold discussions with her in company with other
people, and they should talk of the doings and sayings of other persons,
and examine different things, like jewellery, precious stones, etc. On
such occasions he should show her certain things with the values of
which she may be unacquainted, and if she begins to dispute with him
about the things or their value, he should not contradict her, but point
out that he agrees with her in every way.
Thus ends the ways of making the acquaintance of the woman desired.
Now after a girl has become acquainted with the man as above described,
and has manifested her love to him by the various outward signs; and by
the motions of her body, the man should make every effort to gain her
over. But as girls are not acquainted with sexual union, they should be
treated with the greatest delicacy, and the man should proceed with
considerable caution, though in the case of other women, accustomed to
sexual intercourse, this is not necessary. When the intentions of the
girl are known, and her bashfulness put aside, the man should begin to
make use of her money, and an interchange of clothes, rings, and flowers
should be made. In this the man should take particular care that the
things given by him are handsome and valuable. He should moreover
receive from her a mixture of betel nut and betel leaves, and when he is
going to a party he should ask for the flower in her hair, or for the
flower in her hand. If he himself gives her a flower it should be a
sweet smelling one, and marked with marks made by his nails or teeth.
With increasing assiduity he should dispel her fears, and by degrees get
her to go with him to some lonely place, and there he should embrace and
kiss her. And finally at the time of giving her some betel nut, or of
receiving the same from her, or at the time of making an exchange of
flowers, he should touch and press her private parts, thus bringing his
efforts to a satisfactory conclusion.
When a man is endeavouring to seduce one woman, he should not attempt to
seduce any other at the same time. But after he had succeeded with the
first, and enjoyed her for a considerable time, he can keep her
affections by giving her presents that she likes, and then commence
making up to another woman. When a man sees the husband of a woman going
to some place near his house, he should not enjoy the woman then, even
though she may be easily gained over at that time. A wise man having a
regard for his reputation should not think of seducing a woman who is
apprehensive, timid, not to be trusted, well guarded, or possessed of a
father-in-law, or mother-in-law.
CHAPTER III.
EXAMINATION OF THE STATE OF A WOMAN'S MIND.
When a man is trying to gain over a woman he should examine the state of
her mind, and acts as follows.
If she listens to him, but does not manifest to him in any way her own
intentions, he should then try to gain her over by means of a
go-between.
If she meets him once, and again comes to meet him better dressed than
before, or comes to him in some lonely place, he should be certain that
she is capable of being enjoyed by the use of a little force. A woman
who lets a man make up to her, but does not give herself up, even after
a long time, should be considered as a trifler in love, but owing to the
fickleness of the human mind, even such a woman can be conquered by
always keeping up a close acquaintance with her.
When a woman avoids the attentions of a man, and on account of respect
for him, and pride in herself, will not meet him or approach him, she
can be gained over with difficulty, either by endeavouring to keep on
familiar terms with her, or else by an exceedingly clever go-between.
When a man makes up to a woman, and she reproaches him with harsh words,
she should be abandoned at once.
When a woman reproaches a man, but at the same time acts affectionately
towards him, she should be made love to in every way.
A woman who meets a man in lonely places, and puts up with the touch of
his foot, but pretends, on account of the indecision of her mind, not to
be aware of it, should be conquered by patience, and by continued
efforts as follows:
If she happens to go to sleep in his vicinity he should put his left arm
round her, and see when she awakes whether she repulses him in reality,
or only repulses him in such a way as if she were desirous of the same
thing being done to her again. And what is done by the arm can also be
done by the foot. If the man succeeds in this point he should embrace
her more closely, and if she will not stand the embrace and gets up, but
behaves with him as usual the next day, he should consider then that she
is not unwilling to be enjoyed by him. If however she does not appear
again, the man should try to get over her by means of a go-between; and
if, after having disappeared for some time she again appears, and
behaves with him as usual, the man should then consider that she would
not object to be united with him.
When a woman gives a man an opportunity, and makes her own love manifest
to him, he should proceed to enjoy her. And the signs of a woman
manifesting her love are these:
1. She calls out to a man without being addressed by him in the first
instance.
2. She shows herself to him in secret places.
3. She speaks to him tremblingly and inarticulately.
4. She has the fingers of her hand, and the toes of her feet moistened
with perspiration, and her face blooming with delight.
5. She occupies herself with shampooing his body and pressing his head.
6. When shampooing him she works with one hand only, and with the other
she touches and embraces parts of his body.
7. She remains with both hands placed on his body motionless as if she
had been surprised by something, or was overcome by fatigue.
8. She sometimes bends down her face upon his thighs, and when asked to
shampoo them does not manifest any unwillingness to do so.
9. She places one of her hands quite motionless on his body, and even
though the man should press it between two members of his body, she does
not remove it for a long time.
10. Lastly, when she has resisted all the efforts of the man to gain her
over, she returns to him next day to shampoo his body as before.
When a woman neither gives encouragement to a man, nor avoids him, but
hides herself and remains in some lonely place, she must be got at by
means of the female servant who may be near her. If when called by the
man she acts in the same way, then she should be gained over by means of
a skilful go-between. But if she will have nothing to say to the man, he
should consider well about her before he begins any further attempts to
gain her over.
Thus ends the examination of the state of a woman's mind.
A man should first get himself introduced to a woman, and then carry on
a conversation with her. He should give her hints of his love for her,
and if he finds from her replies that she receives these hints
favourably, he should then set to work to gain her over without any
fear. A woman who shows her love by outward signs to the man at his
first interview should be gained over very easily. In the same way a
lascivious woman, who when addressed in loving words replies openly in
words expressive of her love, should be considered to have been gained
over at that very moment. With regard to all women, whether they be
wise, simple, or confiding, this rule is laid down that those who make
an open manifestation of their love are easily gained over.
CHAPTER IV.
ABOUT THE BUSINESS OF A GO-BETWEEN.
If a woman has manifested her love or desire, either by signs or by
motions of her body, and is afterwards rarely or never seen any where,
or if a woman is met for the first time, the man should get a go-between
to approach her.
Now the go-between, having wheedled herself into the confidence of the
woman by acting according to her disposition, should try to make her
hate or despise her husband by holding artful conversations with her, by
telling her about medicines for getting children, by talking to her
about other people, by tales of various kinds, by stories about the
wives of other men, and by praising her beauty, wisdom, generosity, and
good nature, and then saying to her: It is indeed a pity that you, who
are so excellent a woman in every way, should be possessed of a husband
of this kind. Beautiful lady, he is not fit even to serve you. The
go-between should further talk to the woman about the weakness of the
passion of her husband, his jealousy, his roguery, his ingratitude, his
aversion to enjoyments, his dullness, his meanness, and all the other
faults that he may have, and with which she may be acquainted. She
should particularly harp upon that fault or that failing by which the
wife may appear to be the most affected. If the wife be a deer woman,
and the husband a hare man, then there would be no fault in that
direction, but in the event of his being a hare man, and she a mare
woman or elephant woman, then this fault should be pointed out to her.
Gonikaputra is of opinion that when it is the first affair of the woman,
or when her love has only been very secretly shown, the man should then
secure and send to her a go-between, with whom she may be already
acquainted, and in whom she confides.
But to return to our subject. The go-between should tell the woman about
the obedience and love of the man, and as her confidence and affection
increase, she should then explain to her the thing to be accomplished in
the following way. Hear this, Oh beautiful lady, that this man, born of
a good family, having seen you, has gone mad on your account. The poor
young man, who is tender by nature, has never been distressed in such a
way before, and it is highly probable that he will succumb under his
present affliction, and experience the pains of death. If the woman
listens with a favourable ear, then on the following day the go-between,
having observed marks of good spirits in her face, in her eyes, and in
her manner of conversation, should again converse with her on the
subject of the man, and should tell her the stories of Ahalya[59] and
Indra, of Sakoontala[60] and Dushyanti, and such others as may be fitted
for the occasion. She should also describe to her the strength of the
man, his talents, his skill in the sixty-four sorts of enjoyments
mentioned by Babhravya, his good looks, and his liaison with some
praiseworthy woman, no matter whether this last ever took place or not.
In addition to this, the go-between should carefully note the behaviour
of the woman, which if favourable would be as follows: She would address
her with a smiling look, would seat herself close beside her, and ask
her, Where have you been? What have you been doing? Where did you dine?
Where did you sleep? Where have you been sitting? Moreover the woman
would meet the go-between in lonely places and tell her stories there,
would yawn contemplatively, draw long sighs, give her presents, remember
her on occasions of festivals, dismiss her with a wish to see her again,
and say to her jestingly, Oh, well-speaking woman, why do you speak
these bad words to me? would discourse on the sin of her union with the
man, would not tell her about any previous visits or conversations that
she may have had with him, but wish to be asked about these, and lastly
would laugh at the man's desire, but would not reproach him in any way.
Thus ends the behaviour of the woman with the go-between.
When the woman manifests her love in the manner above described, the
go-between should increase it by bringing to her love tokens from the
man. But if the woman be not acquainted with the man personally, the
go-between should win her over by extolling and praising his good
qualities, and by telling stories about his love for her. Here Auddalaka
says that when a man or woman are not personally acquainted with each
other, and have not shown each other any signs of affection, the
employment of a go-between is useless.
The followers of Babhravya on the other hand affirm that even though
they be personally unacquainted, but have shown each other signs of
affection there is an occasion for the employment of a go-between.
Gonikaputra asserts that a go-between should be employed, provided they
are acquainted with each other, even though no signs of affection may
have passed between them. Vatsyayana however lays it down that even
though they may not be personally acquainted with each other, and may
not have shown each other any signs of affection, still they are both
capable of placing confidence in a go-between.
Now the go-between should show the woman the presents, such as the betel
nut and betel leaves, the perfumes, the flowers, and the rings which the
man may have given to her for the sake of the woman, and on these
presents should be impressed the marks of the man's teeth, and nails,
and other signs. On the cloth that he may send he should draw with
saffron both his hands joined together as if in earnest entreaty.
The go-between should also show to the woman ornamental figures of
various kinds cut in leaves, together with ear ornaments, and chaplets
made of flowers containing love letters expressive of the desire of the
man,[61] and she should cause her to send affectionate presents to the
man in return. After they have mutually accepted each other's presents,
then a meeting should be arranged between them on the faith of the
go-between.
The followers of Babhravya say that this meeting should take place at
the time of going to the temple of a Deity, or on occasions of fairs,
garden parties, theatrical performances, marriages, sacrifices,
festivals and funerals, as also at the time of going to the river to
bathe, or at times of natural calamities,[62] fear of robbers or hostile
invasions of the country.
Gonikaputra is of opinion however that these meetings had better be
brought about in the abodes of female friends, mendicants, astrologers,
and ascetics. But Vatsyayana decides that that place is only well suited
for the purpose which has proper means of ingress and egress, and where
arrangements have been made to prevent any accidental occurrence, and
when a man who has once entered the house, can also leave it at the
proper time without any disagreeable encounter.
Now go-betweens or female messengers are of the following different
kinds, viz.:
(1). A go-between who takes upon herself the whole burden of the
business.
(2). A go-between who does only a limited part of the business.
(3). A go-between who is the bearer of a letter only.
(4). A go-between acting on her own account.
(5). The go-between of an innocent young woman.
(6). A wife serving as a go-between.
(7). A mute go-between.
(8). A go-between who acts the part of the wind.
(1). A woman who, having observed the mutual passion of a man and woman,
brings them together and arranges it by the power of her own intellect,
such an one is called a go-between who takes upon herself the whole
burden of the business. This kind of go-between is chiefly employed when
the man and the woman are already acquainted with each other, and have
conversed together, and in such cases she is sent not only by the man
(as is always done in all other cases) but by the woman also.--The above
name is also given to a go-between who, perceiving that the man and the
woman are suited to each other, tries to bring about a union between
them, even though they be not acquainted with each other.
(2). A go-between who, perceiving that some part of the affair is
already done, or that the advances on the part of the man are already
made, completes the rest of the business, is called a go-between who
performs only a limited part of the business.
(3). A go-between, who simply carries messages between a man and a
woman, who love each other, but who cannot frequently meet, is called
the bearer of a letter or message.
This name is also given to one who is sent by either of the lovers to
acquaint either the one or the other with the time and place of their
meeting.
(4). A woman who goes herself to a man, and tells him of her having
enjoyed sexual union with him in a dream, and expresses her anger at his
wife having rebuked him for calling her by the name of her rival instead
of by her own name, and gives him something bearing the marks of her
teeth and nails, and informs him that she knew she was formerly desired
by him, and asks him privately whether she or his wife is the best
looking, such a person is called a woman who is a go-between for
herself. Now such a woman should be met and interviewed by the man in
private and secretly.
The above name is also given to a woman who having made an agreement
with some other woman to act as her go-between, gains over the man to
herself, by the means of making him personally acquainted with herself,
and thus causes the other woman to fail. The same applies to a man who,
acting as a go-between for another, and having no previous connection
with the woman, gains her over for himself, and thus causes the failure
of the other man.
(5). A woman, who has gained the confidence of the innocent young wife
of any man, and who has learned her secrets without exercising any
pressure on her mind, and found out from her how her husband behaves to
her, if this woman then teaches her the art of securing his favour, and
decorates her so as to show her love, and instructs her how and when to
be angry, or to pretend to be so, and then, having herself made marks of
the nails and teeth on the body of the wife, gets the latter to send for
her husband to show these marks to him, and thus excite him for
enjoyment, such is called the go-between of an innocent young woman. In
such cases the man should send replies to his wife through the same
woman.
(6). When a man gets his wife to gain the confidence of a woman whom he
wants to enjoy, and to call on her and talk to her about the wisdom and
ability of her husband, that wife is called a wife serving as a
go-between. In this case the feelings of the woman with regard to the
man should also be made known through the wife.
(7). When any man sends a girl or a female servant to any woman under
some pretext or other, and places a letter in her bouquet of flowers, or
in her ear ornaments, or marks something about her with his teeth or
nails, that girl or female servant is called a mute go-between. In this
case the man should expect an answer from the woman through the same
person.
(8). A person, who carries a message to a woman, which has a double
meaning, or which relates to some past transactions, or which is
unintelligible to other people, is called a go-between who acts the part
of the wind. In this case the reply should be asked for through the same
woman.
Thus end the different kinds of go-betweens.
A female astrologer, a female servant, a female beggar, or a female
artist are well acquainted with the business of a go-between, and very
soon gain the confidence of other women. Any one of them can raise
enmity between any two persons if she wishes to do so, or extol the
loveliness of any woman that she wishes to praise, or describe the arts
practised by other women in sexual union. They can also speak highly of
the love of a man, of his skill in sexual enjoyment, and of the desire
of other women, more beautiful even than the woman they are addressing,
for him, and explain the restraint under which he may be at home.
Lastly a go-between can, by the artfulness of her conversation unite a
woman with a man, even though he may not have been thought of by her, or
may have been considered beyond his aspirations. She can also bring back
a man to a woman, who, owing to some cause or other, has separated
himself from her.

CHAPTER V.
ABOUT THE LOVE OF PERSONS IN AUTHORITY FOR THE WIVES OF OTHER MEN.
Kings and their ministers have no access to the abodes of others, and
moreover their mode of living is constantly watched and observed and
imitated by the people at large, just as the animal world, seeing the
sun rise, get up after him, and when he sits in the evening, lie down
again in the same way. Persons in authority should not therefore do any
improper act in public, as such are impossible from their position, and
would be deserving of censure. But if they find that such an act is
necessary to be done, they should make use of the proper means as
described in the following paragraphs.
The head man of the village, the King's officer employed there, and the
man[63] whose business it is to glean corn, can gain over female
villagers simply by asking them. It is on this account that this class
of woman are called unchaste women by voluptuaries.
The union of the above mentioned men with this class of woman takes
place on the occasions of unpaid labour, of filling the granaries in
their houses, of taking things in and out of the house, of cleaning the
houses, of working in the fields, and of purchasing cotton, wool, flax,
hemp, and thread, and at the season of the purchase, sale, and exchange
of various other articles, as well as at the time of doing various other
works. In the same way the superintendents of cow pens enjoy the women
in the cow pens; and the officers, who have the superintendence of
widows, of the women who are without supporters, and of women who have
left their husbands, have sexual intercourse with these women. The
intelligent accomplish their object by wandering at night in the
village, and while villagers also unite with the wives of their sons,
being much alone with them. Lastly the superintendents of markets have a
great deal to do with the female villagers at the time of their making
purchases in the market.
During the festival of the eighth moon, _i.e._, during the bright half
of the month of Nargashirsha, as also during the moonlight festival of
the month of Kartika, and the spring festival of Chaitra, the women of
cities and towns generally visit the women of the King's harem in the
royal palace. These visitors go to the several apartments of the women
of the harem, as they are acquainted with them, and pass the night in
conversation, and in proper sports, and amusement, and go away in the
morning. On such occasions a female attendant of the King (previously
acquainted with the woman whom the King desires), should loiter about,
and accost this woman when she sets out to go home, and induce her to
come and see the amusing things in the palace. Previous to these
festivals even, she should have caused it to be intimated to this woman
that on the occasion of this festival she would show her all the
interesting things in the royal palace. Accordingly she should show her
the bower of the coral creeper, the garden house with its floor inlaid
with precious stones, the bower of grapes, the building on the water,
the secret passages in the walls of the palace, the pictures, the
sporting animals, the machines, the birds, and the cages of the lions
and the tigers. After this, when alone with her, she should tell her
about the love of the King for her, and should describe to her the good
fortune which would attend upon her union with the King, giving her at
the time a strict promise of secrecy. If the woman does not accept the
offer, she should conciliate and please her with handsome presents
befitting the position of the King, and having accompanied her for some
distance should dismiss her with great affection.
(2). Or, having made the acquaintance of the husband of the woman whom
the King desires, the wives of the King should get the wife to pay them
a visit in the harem, and on this occasion a female attendant of the
King, having been sent thither, should act as above described.
(3). Or, one of the King's wives should get acquainted with the woman
that the King desires, by sending one of the female attendants to her,
who should, on their becoming more intimate, induce her to come and see
the royal abode. Afterwards, when she has visited the harem, and
acquired confidence, a female confidante of the King, sent thither,
should act as before described.
(4). Or, the King's wife should invite the woman, whom the King desires,
to come to the royal palace, so that she might see the practice of the
art in which the King's wife may be skilled, and after she has come to
the harem, a female attendant of the King, sent thither, should act as
before described.
(5). Or, a female beggar, in league with the King's wife, should say to
the woman desired by the King, and whose husband may have lost his
wealth, or may have some cause of fear from the King: This wife of the
King has influence over him, and she is, moreover, naturally
kind-hearted, we must therefore go to her in this matter. I shall
arrange for your entrance into the harem, and she will do away with all
cause of danger and fear from the King. If the woman accepts this
offer, the female beggar should take her two or three times to the
harem, and the King's wife there should give her a promise of
protection. After this, when the woman, delighted with her reception and
promise of protection, again goes to the harem, then a female attendant
of the King, sent thither, should act as directed.
(6). What has been said above regarding the wife of one who has some
cause of fear from the King applies also to the wives of those who seek
service under the King, or who are oppressed by the King's ministers, or
who are poor, or who are not satisfied with their position, or who are
desirous of gaining the King's favour, or who wish to become famous
among the people, or who are oppressed by the members of their own
caste, or who want to injure their caste fellows, or who are spies of
the King, or who have any other object to attain.
(7). Lastly, if the woman desired by the King be living with some person
who is not her husband, then the King should cause her to be arrested,
and having made her a slave, on account of her crime, should place her
in the harem. Or the King should cause his ambassador to quarrel with
the husband of the woman desired by him, and should then imprison her as
the wife of an enemy of the King, and by this means should place her in
the harem.
Thus end the means of gaining over the wives of others secretly.
The above mentioned ways of gaining over the wives of other men are
chiefly practised in the palaces of Kings. But a King should never enter
the abode of another person, for Abhira,[64] the King of the Kottas was
killed by a washerman while in the house of another, and in the same way
Jayasana the King of the Kashis was slain by the commandment of his
cavalry.
But according to the customs of some countries there are facilities for
Kings to make love to the wives of other men. Thus in the country of the
Andras[65] the newly married daughters of the people thereof enter the
King's harem with some presents on the tenth day of their marriage, and
having been enjoyed by the King are then dismissed. In the country of
the Vatsagulmas[66] the wives of the chief ministers approach the King
at night to serve him. In the country of the Vaidarbhas[67] the
beautiful wives of the inhabitants pass a month in the King's harem
under the pretence of affection for the King. In the country of the
Aparatakas[68] the people gave their beautiful wives as presents to the
ministers and the Kings. And lastly in the country of the
Saurashtras[69] the women of the city and the country enter the royal
harem for the King's pleasure either together or separately.
There are also two verses on the subject as follows:
The above and other ways are the means employed in different countries
by Kings with regard to the wives of other persons. But a King, who has
the welfare of his people at heart, should not on any account put them
into practice.
A King who has conquered the six[70] enemies of mankind, becomes the
master of the whole earth.

CHAPTER VI.
ABOUT THE WOMEN OF THE ROYAL HAREM; AND OF THE KEEPING OF ONE'S OWN
WIFE.
The women of the royal harem cannot see or meet any men on account of
their being strictly guarded, neither do they have their desires
satisfied, because their only husband is common to many wives. For this
reason among themselves they give pleasure to each other in various ways
as now described.
Having dressed the daughters of their nurses, or their female friends,
or their female attendants, like men, they accomplish their object by
means of bulbs, roots, and fruits having the form of the Lingam, or they
lie down upon the statue of a male figure, in which the Lingam is
visible and erect.
Some Kings, who are compassionate, take or apply certain medicines to
enable them to enjoy many wives in one night, simply for the purpose of
satisfying the desire of their women, though they perhaps have no desire
of their own. Others enjoy with great affection only those wives that
they particularly like, while others only take them according as the
turn of each wife arrives in due course. Such are the ways of enjoyment
prevalent in Eastern countries, and what is said about the means of
enjoyment of the female is also applicable to the male.
By means of their female attendants the ladies of the royal harem
generally get men into their apartments in the disguise or dress of
women. Their female attendants, and the daughters of their nurses, who
are acquainted with their secrets, should exert themselves to get men to
come to the harem in this way by telling them of the good fortune
attending it, and by describing the facilities of entering and leaving
the palace, the large size of the premises, the carelessness of the
sentinels, and the irregularities of the attendants about the persons of
the royal wives. But these women should never induce a man to enter the
harem by telling him falsehoods, for that would probably lead to his
destruction.
As for the man himself, he had better not enter a royal harem, even
though it may be easily accessible, on account of the numerous disasters
to which he may be exposed there. If however he wants to enter it, he
should first ascertain whether there is an easy way to get out, whether
it is closely surrounded by the pleasure garden, whether it has separate
enclosures belonging to it, whether the sentinels are careless, whether
the King has gone abroad, and then, when he is called by the women of
the harem, he should carefully observe the localities, and enter by the
way pointed out by them. If he is able to manage it, he should hang
about the harem every day, and, under some pretext or other, make
friends with the sentinels, and show himself attached to the female
attendants of the harem, who may have become acquainted with his design,
and to whom he should express his regret at not being able to obtain the
object of his desire. Lastly he should cause the whole business of a
go-between to be done by the woman who may have access to the harem, and
he should be careful to be able to recognize the emissaries of the King.
When a go-between has no access to the harem, then the man should stand
in some place where the lady, whom he loves, and whom he is anxious to
enjoy, can be seen.
If that place is occupied by the King's sentinels, he should then
disguise himself as a female attendant of the lady who comes to the
place, or passes by it. When she looks at him he should let her know his
feelings by outward signs and gestures, and should show her pictures,
things with double meanings, chaplets of flowers, and rings. He should
carefully mark the answer she gives, whether by word or by sign, or by
gesture, and should then try and get into the harem. If he is certain of
her coming to some particular place he should conceal himself there, and
at the appointed time should enter along with her as one of the guards.
He may also go in and out, concealed in a folded bed, or bed covering,
or with his body made invisible,[71] by means of external applications,
a receipt for one of which is as follows:
The heart of an ichneumon, the fruit of the long gourd (Tumbi), and the
eyes of the serpent, should all be burnt without letting out the smoke,
the ashes should then be ground and mixed in equal quantities with
water. By putting this mixture upon the eyes a man can go about unseen.
Other means of invisibility are prescribed by Duyana Brahmans and
Jogashiras.
Again the man may enter the harem during the festival of the eight moon
in the month of Nargashirsha, and during the moonlight festivals when
the female attendants of the harem are all busily occupied, or in
confusion.
The following principles are laid down on this subject.
The entrance of young men into harems, and their exit from them,
generally take place when things are being brought into the palace, or
when things are being taken out of it, or when drinking festivals are
going on, or when the female attendants are in a hurry, or when the
residence of some of the royal ladies is being changed, or when the
King's wives go to gardens, or to fairs, or when they enter the palace
on their return from them; or, lastly, when the King is absent on a long
pilgrimage. The women of the royal harem know each other's secrets, and
having but one object to attain, they give assistance to each other. A
young man, who enjoys all of them, and who is common to them all, can
continue enjoying his union with them so long as it is kept quiet, and
is not known abroad.
Now in the country of the Aparatakas the royal ladies are not well
protected, and consequently many young men are passed into the harem by
the women who have access to the royal palaces. The wives of the King of
the Ahira country accomplish their objects with those sentinels in the
harem who bear the name of Kashtriyas. The royal ladies in the country
of the Vatsagulmas cause such men as are suitable to enter into the
harem along with their female messengers. In the country of the
Vaidarbhas the sons of the royal ladies enter the royal harem when they
please, and enjoy the women, with the exception of their own mothers. In
the Stri-rajya the wives of the King are enjoyed by his caste fellows
and relations. In the Ganda country the royal wives are enjoyed by
Brahmans, friends, servants, and slaves. In the Samdhava country,
servants, foster children, and other persons like them enjoy the women
of the harem. In the country of the Haimavatas adventurous citizens
bribe the sentinels and enter the harem. In the country of the Vanyas
and the Kalmyas, Brahmans, with the knowledge of the King, enter the
harem under the pretence of giving flowers to the ladies, and speak with
them from behind a curtain, and from such conversation union afterwards
takes place. Lastly, the women in the harem of the King of the Prachyas
conceal one young man in the harem for every batch of nine or ten of the
women.
Thus act the wives of others.
For these reasons a man should guard his own wife. Old authors say that
a King should select for sentinels in his harem such men as have their
freedom from carnal desires well tested. But such men, though free
themselves from carnal desire, by reason of their fear or avarice, may
cause other persons to enter the harem, and therefore Gonikaputra says,
that Kings should place such men in the harem as may have had their
freedom from carnal desires, their fears, and their avarice well tested.
Lastly, Vatsyayana says that under the influence of Dharma[72] people
might be admitted, and therefore men should be selected who are free
from carnal desires, fear, avarice, and Dharma.[73]
The followers of Babhravya say that a man should cause his wife to
associate with a young woman who would tell him the secrets of other
people, and thus find out from her about his wife's chastity. But
Vatsyayana says, that as wicked persons are always successful with
women, a man should not cause his innocent wife to be corrupted by
bringing her into the company of a deceitful woman.
The following are the causes of the destruction of a woman's chastity:
Always going into society, and sitting in company.
Absence of restraint.
The loose habits of her husband.
Want of caution in her relations with other men.
Continued and long absence of her husband.
Living in a foreign country.
Destruction of her love and feelings by her husband.
The company of loose women.
The jealousy of her husband.
There are also the following verses on the subject.
A clever man, learning from the Shastras the ways of winning over the
wives of other people, is never deceived in the case of his own wives.
No one, however, should make use of these ways for seducing the wives of
others, because they do not always succeed, and, moreover, often cause
disasters, and the destruction of Dharma and Artha. This book, which is
intended for the good of the people, and to teach them the ways of
guarding their own wives, should not be made use of merely for gaining
over the wives of others.

=END OF PART V.=
PART VI.
ABOUT COURTESANS.
INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.
This Part VI., about courtesans, was prepared by Vatsyayana, from a
treatise on the subject, that was written by Dattaka, for the women of
Pataliputra (the modern Patna), some two thousand years ago. Dattaka's
work does not appear to be extant now, but this abridgement of it is
very clever, and quite equal to any of the productions of Emile Zola,
and other writers of the realistic school of to-day.
Although a great deal has been written on the subject of the courtesan,
nowhere will be found a better description of her, of her belongings, of
her ideas, and of the working of her mind, than is contained in the
following pages.
The details of the domestic and social life of the early Hindoos would
not be complete without mention of the courtesan, and Part VI. is
entirely devoted to this subject. The Hindoos have ever had the good
sense to recognise courtesans as a part and portion of human society,
and so long as they behaved themselves with decency and propriety, they
were regarded with a certain respect. Anyhow, they have never been
treated in the East with that brutality and contempt so common in the
West, while their education has always been of a superior kind to that
bestowed upon the rest of womankind in Oriental countries.
In the earlier days the well-educated Hindoo dancing girl and courtesan
doubtless resembled the Hetera of the Greeks, and being educated and
amusing, were far more acceptable as companions than the generality of
the married or unmarried women of that period. At all times and in all
countries, there has ever been a little rivalry between the chaste and
the unchaste. But while some women are born courtesans, and follow the
instincts of their nature in every class of society, it has been truly
said by some authors that every woman has got an inkling of the
profession in her nature, and does her best, as a general rule, to make
herself agreeable to the male sex.
The subtlety of women, their wonderful perceptive powers, their
knowledge, and their intuitive appreciation of men and things, are all
shown in the following pages, which may be looked upon as a concentrated
essence that has been since worked up into detail by many writers in
every quarter of the globe.
CHAPTER I.
OF THE CAUSES OF A COURTESAN RESORTING TO MEN; OF THE MEANS OF ATTACHING
TO HERSELF THE MAN DESIRED; AND OF THE KIND OF MAN THAT IT IS DESIRABLE
TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH.
By having intercourse with men courtesans obtain sexual pleasure, as
well as their own maintenance. Now when a courtesan takes up with a man
from love, the action is natural; but when she resorts to him for the
purpose of getting money, her action is artificial or forced. Even in
the latter case, however, she should conduct herself as if her love were
indeed natural, because men repose their confidence on those women who
apparently love them. In making known her love to the man she should
show an entire freedom from avarice, and for the sake of her future
credit she should abstain from acquiring money from him by unlawful
means.
A courtesan, well dressed and wearing her ornaments, should sit or stand
at the door of her house, and without exposing herself too much, should
look on the public road so as to be seen by the passers by, she being
like an object on view for sale.[74] She should form friendships with
such persons as would enable her to separate men from other women, and
attach them to herself, and repair her own misfortunes, to acquire
wealth, and to protect her from being bullied, or set upon by persons
with whom she may have dealings of some kind or another.
These persons are:
The guards of the town, or the police.
The officers of the courts of justice.
Astrologers.
Powerful men, or men with interest.
Learned men.
Teachers of the sixty-four arts.
Pithamardas or confidants.
Vitas or parasites.
Vidushakas or jesters.
Flower sellers.
Perfumers.
Vendors of spirits.
Washermen.
Barbers.
Beggars.
And such other persons as may be found necessary for the particular
object to be acquired.
The following kinds of men may be taken up with simply for the purpose
of getting their money.
Men of independent income.
Young men.
Men who are free from any ties.
Men who hold places of authority under the King.
Men who have secured their means of livelihood without difficulty.
Men possessed of unfailing sources of income.
Men who consider themselves handsome.
Men who are always praising themselves.
One who is an eunuch, but wishes to be thought a man.
One who hates his equals.
One who is naturally liberal.
One who has influence with the King or his ministers.
One who is always fortunate.
One who is proud of his wealth.
One who disobeys the orders of his elders.
One upon whom the members of his caste keep an eye.
The only son whose father is wealthy.
An ascetic who is internally troubled with desire.
A brave man.
A physician of the King.
Previous acquaintance.
On the other hand, those who are possessed of excellent qualities are to
be resorted to for the sake of love, and fame. Such men are as follows:
Men of high birth, learned, with a good knowledge of the world, and
doing the proper things at the proper times, poets, good story tellers,
eloquent men, energetic men, skilled in various arts, far-seeing into
the future, possessed of great minds, full of perseverance, of a firm
devotion, free from anger, liberal, affectionate to their parents, and
with a liking for all social gatherings, skilled in completing verses
begun by others and in various other sports, free from all disease,
possessed of a perfect body, strong, and not addicted to drinking,
powerful in sexual enjoyment, sociable, showing love towards women and
attracting their hearts to himself, but not entirely devoted to them,
possessed of independent means of livelihood, free from envy, and last
of all free from suspicion.
Such are the good qualities of a man.
The woman also should have the following characteristics, viz.:
She should be possessed of beauty, and amiability, with auspicious body
marks. She should have a liking for good qualities in other people, as
also a liking for wealth. She should take delight in sexual unions
resulting from love, and should be of a firm mind, and of the same class
as the man with regard to sexual enjoyment.
She should always be anxious to acquire and obtain experience and
knowledge, be free from avarice, and always have a liking for social
gatherings, and for the arts.
The following are the ordinary qualities of all women, viz.:
To be possessed of intelligence, good disposition, and good manners; to
be straightforward in behaviour, and to be grateful; to consider well
the future before doing anything; to possess activity, to be of
consistent behaviour, and to have a knowledge of the proper times and
places for doing things; to speak always without meanness, loud
laughter, malignity, anger, avarice, dullness, or stupidity, to have a
knowledge of the Kama Sutra, and to be skilled in all the arts connected
with it.
The faults of the women are to be known by the absence of any of the
above mentioned good qualities.
The following kinds of men are not fit to be resorted to by courtesans,
viz.:
One who is consumptive; one who is sickly; one whose mouth contains
worms; one whose breath smells like human excrement; one whose wife is
dear to him; one who speaks harshly; one who is always suspicious; one
who is avaricious; one who is pitiless; one who is a thief; one who is
self-conceited; one who has a liking for sorcery; one who does not care
for respect or disrespect; one who can be gained over even by his
enemies by means of money; and lastly, one who is extremely bashful.
Ancient authors are of opinion that the causes of a courtesan resorting
to men are love, fear, money, pleasure, returning some act of enmity,
curiosity, sorrow, constant intercourse, Dharma, celebrity, compassion,
the desire of having a friend, shame, the likeness of the man to some
beloved person, the search after good fortune, the getting rid of the
love of somebody else, the being of the same class as the man with
respect to sexual union, living in the same place, constancy, and
poverty. But Vatsyayana decides that desire of wealth, freedom from
misfortune, and love, are the only causes that affect the union of
courtesans with men.
Now a courtesan should not sacrifice money to her love, because money is
the chief thing to be attended to. But in cases of fear, etc., she
should pay regard to strength and other qualities. Moreover, even though
she be invited by any man to join him, she should not at once consent to
an union, because men are apt to despise things which are easily
acquired. On such occasions she should first send the shampooers, and
the singers, and the jesters, who may be in her service, or, in their
absence the Pithamardas, or confidants, and others, to find out the
state of his feelings, and the condition of his mind. By means of these
persons she should ascertain whether the man is pure or impure,
affected, or the reverse, capable of attachment, or indifferent, liberal
or niggardly; and if she finds him to her liking, she should then
employ the Vita and others to attach his mind to her.
Accordingly, the Pithamarda should bring the man to her house, under the
pretence of seeing the fights of quails, cocks, and rams, of hearing the
maina (a kind of starling) talk, or of seeing some other spectacle, or
the practice of some art; or he may take the woman to the abode of the
man. After this, when the man comes to her house the woman should give
him something capable of producing curiosity, and love in his heart,
such as an affectionate present, telling him that it was specially
designed for his use. She should also amuse him for a long time by
telling him such stories, and doing such things as he may take most
delight in. When he goes away she should frequently send to him a female
attendant, skilled in carrying on a jesting conversation, and also a
small present at the same time. She should also sometimes go to him
herself under the pretence of some business, and accompanied by the
Pithamarda.
Thus end the means of attaching to herself the man desired.
There are also some verses on the subject as follows:
When a lover comes to her abode, a courtesan should give him a mixture
of betel leaves and betel nut, garlands of flowers, and perfumed
ointments, and, showing her skill in arts, should entertain him with a
long conversation. She should also give him some loving presents, and
make an exchange of her own things with his, and at the same time should
show him her skill in sexual enjoyment. When a courtesan is thus united
with her lover she should always delight him by affectionate gifts, by
conversation, and by the application of tender means of enjoyment.
FOOTNOTE:
[Footnote 74: In England the lower classes of courtesans walk the
streets; in India and other places in the East they sit at the windows,
or at the doors of their houses.]
CHAPTER II.
OF LIVING LIKE A WIFE.
When a courtesan is living as a wife with her lover, she should behave
like a chaste woman, and do everything to his satisfaction. Her duty in
this respect, in short, is, that she should give him pleasure, but
should not become attached to him, though behaving as if she were really
attached.
Now the following is the manner in which she is to conduct herself, so
as to accomplish the above mentioned purpose. She should have a mother
dependent on her, one who should be represented as very harsh, and who
looked upon money as her chief object in life. In the event of there
being no mother, then an old and confidential nurse should play the same
role. The mother or nurse, on their part, should appear to be displeased
with the lover, and forcibly take her away from him. The woman herself
should always show pretended anger, dejection, fear, and shame on this
account, but should not disobey the mother or nurse at any time.
She should make out to the mother or nurse that the man is suffering
from bad health, and making this a pretext for going to see him, she
should go on that account. She is, moreover, to do the following things
for the purpose of gaining the man's favour, viz.:
Sending her female attendant to bring the flowers used by him on the
previous day, in order that she may use them herself as a mark of
affection, also asking for the mixture of betel nut and leaves that have
remained uneaten by him; expressing wonder at his knowledge of sexual
intercourse, and the several means of enjoyment used by him; learning
from him the sixty-four kinds of pleasure mentioned by Babhravya;
continually practising the ways of enjoyment as taught by him, and
according to his liking; keeping his secrets; telling him her own
desires and secrets; concealing her anger; never neglecting him on the
bed when he turns his face towards her; touching any parts of his body
according to his wish; kissing and embracing him when he is asleep;
looking at him with apparent anxiety when he is wrapt in thought, or
thinking of some other subject than herself; showing neither complete
shamelessness, nor excessive bashfulness when he meets her, or sees her
standing on the terrace of her house from the public road; hating his
enemies; loving those who are dear to him; showing a liking for that
which he likes; being in high or low spirits according to the state that
he is in himself; expressing a curiosity to see his wives; not
continuing her anger for a long time; suspecting even the marks and
wounds made by herself with her nails and teeth on his body to have been
made by some other woman; keeping her love for him unexpressed by words,
but showing it by deeds, and signs, and hints; remaining silent when he
is asleep, intoxicated, or sick; being very attentive when he describes
his good actions, and reciting them afterwards to his praise and
benefit; giving witty replies to him if he be sufficiently attached to
her; listening to all his stories, except those that relate to her
rivals; expressing feelings of dejection and sorrow if he sighs, yawns,
or falls down; pronouncing the words live long when he sneezes;
pretending to be ill, or to have the desire of pregnancy, when she feels
dejected; abstaining from praising the good qualities of any body else,
and from censuring those who possess the same faults as her own man:
wearing anything that may have been given to her by him; abstaining from
putting on her ornaments, and from taking food when he is in pain, sick,
low-spirited, or suffering from misfortune, and condoling and lamenting
with him over the same; wishing to accompany him if he happens to leave
the country himself or if he be banished from it by the King; expressing
a desire not to live after him; telling him that the whole object and
desire of her life was to be united with him; offering previously
promised sacrifices to the Deity when he acquires wealth, or has some
desire fulfilled, or when he has recovered from some illness or disease;
putting on ornaments every day; not acting too freely with him; reciting
his name and the name of his family in her songs; placing his hand on
her loins, bosom and forehead, and falling asleep after feeling the
pleasure of his touch; sitting on his lap and falling asleep there;
wishing to have a child by him; desiring not to live longer than he
does; abstaining from revealing his secrets to others; dissuading him
from vows and fasts by saying let the sin fall upon me; keeping vows
and fasts along with him when it is impossible to change his mind on the
subject; telling him that vows and fasts are difficult to be observed,
even by herself, when she has any dispute with him about them; looking
on her own wealth and his without any distinction; abstaining from going
to public assemblies without him, and accompanying him when he desires
her to do so; taking delight in using things previously used by him, and
in eating food that he has left uneaten; venerating his family, his
disposition, his skill in the arts, his learning, his caste, his
complexion, his native country, his friends, his good qualities, his
age, and his sweet temper; asking him to sing, and to do other such like
things, if able to do them; going to him without paying any regard to
fear, to cold, to heat, or to rain; saying with regard to the next world
that he should be her lover even there; adapting her tastes, disposition
and actions to his liking; abstaining from sorcery; disputing
continually with her mother on the subject of going to him, and, when
forcibly taken by her mother to some other place, expressing her desire
to die by taking poison, by starving herself to death, by stabbing
herself with some weapon, or by hanging herself; and lastly assuring the
man of her constancy and love by means of her agents, and receiving
money herself, but abstaining from any dispute with her mother with
regard to pecuniary matters.
When the man sets out on a journey, she should make him swear that he
will return quickly, and in his absence should put aside her vows of
worshipping the Deity, and should wear no ornaments except those that
are lucky. If the time fixed for his return has passed, she should
endeavour to ascertain the real time of his return from omens, from the
reports of the people, and from the positions of the planets, the moon
and the stars. On occasions of amusement, and of auspicious dreams, she
should say Let me be soon united to him. If, moreover, she feels
melancholy, or sees any inauspicious omen, she should perform some rite
to appease the Deity.
When the man does return home she should worship the God Kama (_i.e._,
the Indian Cupid), and offer oblations to other Deities, and having
caused a pot filled with water to be brought by her friends, she should
perform the worship in honour of the crow who eats the offerings which
we make to the manes of deceased relations. After the first visit is
over she should ask her lover also to perform certain rites, and this he
will do if he is sufficiently attached to her.
Now a man is said to be sufficiently attached to a woman when his love
is disinterested; when he has the same object in view as his beloved
one; when he is quite free from any suspicions on her account; and when
he is indifferent to money with regard to her.
Such is the manner of a courtesan living with a man like a wife, and set
forth here for the sake of guidance from the rules of Dattaka. What is
not laid down here should be practised according to the custom of the
people, and the nature of each individual man.
There are also two verses on the subject as follows:
The extent of the love of women is not known, even to those who are the
objects of their affection, on account of its subtlety, and on account
of the avarice, and natural intelligence of womankind.
Women are hardly ever known in their true light, though they may love
men, or become indifferent towards them; may give them delight, or
abandon them; or may extract from them all the wealth that they may
possess.
CHAPTER III.
OF THE MEANS OF GETTING MONEY. OF THE SIGNS OF THE CHANGE OF A LOVER'S
FEELINGS, AND OF THE WAY TO GET RID OF HIM.
Money is got out of a lover in two ways, viz.:
By natural or lawful means, and by artifices. Old authors are of opinion
that when a courtesan can get as much money as she wants from her lover,
she should not make use of artifice. But Vatsyayana lays down that
though she may get some money from him by natural means, yet when she
makes use of artifice he gives her doubly more, and therefore artifice
should be resorted to for the purpose of extorting money from him at all
events.
Now the artifices to be used for getting money from her lover are as
follows:
1st. Taking money from him on different occasions, for the purpose of
purchasing various articles, such as ornaments, food, drink, flowers,
perfumes and cloths, and either not buying them, or getting from him
more than their cost.
2nd. Praising his intelligence to his face.
3rd. Pretending to be obliged to make gifts on occasion of festivals
connected with vows, trees, gardens, temples, or tanks.[75]
4th. Pretending that at the time of going to his house, her jewels have
been stolen either by the King's guards, or by robbers.
5th. Alleging that her property has been destroyed by fire, by the
falling of her house, or by the carelessness of her servants.
6th. Pretending to have lost the ornaments of her lover along with her
own.
7th. Causing him to hear through other people of the expenses incurred
by her in coming to see him.
8th. Contracting debts for the sake of her lover.
9th. Disputing with her mother on account of some expense incurred by
her for her lover, and which was not approved of by her mother.
10th. Not going to parties and festivities in the houses of her friends
for the want of presents to make to them, she having previously informed
her lover of the valuable presents given to her by these very friends.
11th. Not performing certain festive rites under the pretence that she
has no money to perform them with.
12th. Engaging artists to do something for her lover.
13th. Entertaining physicians and ministers for the purpose of attaining
some object.
14th. Assisting friends and benefactors both on festive occasions, and
in misfortune.
15th. Performing household rites.
16th. Having to pay the expenses of the ceremony of marriage of the son
of a female friend.
17th. Having to satisfy curious wishes during her state of pregnancy.
18th. Pretending to be ill, and charging her cost of treatment.
19th. Having to remove the troubles of a friend.
20th. Selling some of her ornaments, so as to give her lover a present.
21st. Pretending to sell some of her ornaments, furniture, or cooking
utensils to a trader, who has been already tutored how to behave in the
matter.
22nd. Having to buy cooking utensils of greater value than those of
other people, so that they might be more easily distinguished, and not
changed for others of an inferior description.
23rd. Remembering the former favours of her lover, and causing them
always to be spoken of by her friends and followers.
24th. Informing her lover of the great gains of other courtezans.
25th. Describing before them, and in the presence of her lover, her own
great gains, and making them out to be greater even than theirs, though
such may not have been really the case.
26th. Openly opposing her mother when she endeavours to persuade her to
take up with men with whom she has been formerly acquainted, on account
of the great gains to be got from them.
27th. Lastly, pointing out to her lover the liberality of his rivals.
Thus end the ways and means of getting money.
*       *       *       *       *
A woman should always know the state of the mind, of the feelings, and
of the disposition of her lover towards her, from the changes of his
temper, his manner, and the colour of his face.
The behaviour of a waning lover is as follows:
1st. He gives the woman either less than is wanted, or something else
than that which is asked for.
2nd. He keeps her in hopes by promises.
3rd. He pretends to do one thing, and does something else.
4th. He does not fulfil her desires.
5th. He forgets his promises, or does something else than that which he
has promised.
6th. He speaks with his own servants in a mysterious way.
7th. He sleeps in some other house under the pretence of having to do
something for a friend.
8th. Lastly, he speaks in private with the attendants of a woman with
whom he was formerly acquainted.
Now when a courtesan finds that her lover's disposition towards her is
changing, she should get possession of all his best things before he
becomes aware of her intentions, and allow a supposed creditor to take
them away forcibly from her in satisfaction of some pretended debt.
After this, if the lover is rich, and has always behaved well towards
her, she should ever treat him with respect; but if he is poor and
destitute, she should get rid of him as if she had never been acquainted
with him in any way before.
The means of getting rid of a lover are as follows:
1st. Describing the habits and vices of the lover as disagreeable and
censurable, with the sneer of the lip, and the stamp of the foot.
2nd. Speaking on a subject with which he is not acquainted.
3rd. Showing no admiration for his learning, and passing a censure upon
it.
4th. Putting down his pride.
5th. Seeking the company of men who are superior to him in learning and
wisdom.
6th. Showing a disregard for him on all occasions.
7th. Censuring men possessed of the same faults as her lover.
8th. Expressing dissatisfaction at the ways and means of enjoyment used
by him.
9th. Not giving him her mouth to kiss.
10th. Refusing access to her Jaghana, _i.e._, the part of the body
between the navel and the thighs.
11th. Showing a dislike for the wounds made by his nails and teeth.
12th. Not pressing close up against him at the time when he embraces
her.
13th. Keeping her limbs without movement at the time of congress.
14th. Desiring him to employ her when he is fatigued.
15th. Laughing at his attachment to her.
16th. Not responding to his embraces.
17th. Turning away from him when he begins to embrace her.
18th. Pretending to be sleepy.
19th. Going out visiting, or into company, when she perceives his desire
to enjoy her during the day time.
20th. Mis-constructing his words.
21st. Laughing without any joke, or at the time of any joke made by him,
laughing under some pretence.
22nd. Looking with side glances at her own attendants, and clapping her
hands when he says anything.
23rd. Interrupting him in the middle of his stories, and beginning to
tell other stories herself.
24th. Reciting his faults and his vices, and declaring them to be
incurable.
25th. Saying words to her female attendants calculated to cut the heart
of her lover to the quick.
26th. Taking care not to look at him when he comes to her.
27th. Asking him what cannot be granted.
28th. And, after all, finally dismissing him.
There are also two verses on this subject as follows:
The duty of a courtesan consists in forming connections with suitable
men after due and full consideration, and attaching the person with whom
she is united to herself; in obtaining wealth from the person who is
attached to her, and then dismissing him after she has taken away all
his possessions.
A courtesan leading in this manner the life of a wife is not troubled
with too many lovers, and yet obtains abundance of wealth.
FOOTNOTE:
[Footnote 75: On the completion of a vow a festival takes place. Some
trees such as the Peepul and Banyan trees, are invested with sacred
threads like the Brahman's, and on the occasion of this ceremony a
festival is given. In the same way when gardens are made, and tanks or
temples built, then also festivals are observed.]
CHAPTER IV.
ABOUT RE-UNION WITH A FORMER LOVER.
When a courtesan abandons her present lover after all his wealth is
exhausted, she may then consider about her re-union with a former lover.
But she should return to him only if he has acquired fresh wealth, or is
still wealthy, and if he is still attached to her. And if this man be
living at the time with some other women she should consider well before
she acts.
Now such a man can only be in one of the six following conditions, viz.:
1st. He may have left the first woman of his own accord, and may even
have left another woman since then.
2nd. He may have been driven away from both women.
3rd. He may have left the one woman of his own accord, and be living
with another woman.
5th. He may have been driven away from the one woman, and left the other
of his own accord.
6th. He may have been driven away by the one woman, and may be living
with another.
(1). Now if the man has left both women of his own accord, he should not
be resorted to, on account of the fickleness of his mind, and his
indifference to the excellencies of both of them.
(2). As regards the man who may have been driven away from both women,
if he has been driven away from the last one because the woman could get
more money from some other man, then he should be resorted to, for if
attached to the first woman he would give her more money, through vanity
and emulation to spite the other woman. But if he has been driven away
by the woman on account of his poverty, or stinginess, he should not
then be resorted to.
(3). In the case of the man who may have left the one woman of his own
accord, and been driven away by the other, if he agrees to return to the
former and give her plenty of money beforehand, then he should be
resorted to.
(4). In the case of the man who may have left the one woman of his own
accord, and be living with another woman, the former (wishing to take up
with him again) should first ascertain if he left her in the first
instance in the hope of finding some particular excellence in the other
woman, and that not having found any such excellence, he was willing to
come back to her, and to give her much money on account of his conduct,
and on account of his affection still existing for her.
Or, whether, having discovered many faults in the other woman, he would
now see even more excellences in herself than actually exist, and would
be prepared to give her much money for these qualities.
Or, lastly, to consider whether he was a weak man, or a man fond of
enjoying many women, or one who liked a poor woman, or one who never did
anything for the woman that he was with. After maturely considering all
these things, she should resort to him or not, according to
circumstances.
(5). As regards the man who may have been driven away from the one
woman, and left the other of his own accord, the former woman (wishing
to re-unite with him) should first ascertain whether he still has any
affection for her, and would consequently spend much money upon her; or
whether, being attached to her excellent qualities, he did not take
delight in any other women; or whether, being driven away from her
formerly before completely satisfying his sexual desires, he wished to
get back to her, so as to be revenged for the injury done to him; or
whether he wished to create confidence in her mind, and then take back
from her the wealth which she formerly took from him, and finally
destroy her; or, lastly, whether he wished first to separate her from
her present lover, and then to break away from her himself. If, after
considering all these things, she is of opinion that his intentions are
really pure and honest, she can re-unite herself with him. But if his
mind be at all tainted with evil intentions, he should be avoided.
(6). In the case of the man who may have been driven away by one
woman, and be living with another, if the man makes overtures in return
to the first one, the courtesan should consider well before she acts,
and while the other woman is engaged in attracting him to herself, she
should try in her turn (through keeping herself behind the scenes) to
gain him over, on the grounds of any of the following considerations,
viz.:
1st. That he was driven away unjustly and for no proper reason, and now
that he has gone to another woman, every effort must be used to bring
him back to myself.
2nd. That if he were once to converse with me again, he would break away
from the other woman.
3rd. That the pride of my present lover would be put down by means of
the former one.
4th. That he has become wealthy, has secured a higher position, and
holds a place of authority under the King.
5th. That he is separate from his wife.
6th. That he is now independent.
7th. That he lives apart from his father, or brother.
8th. That by making peace with him I shall be able to get hold of a very
rich man, who is now prevented from coming to me by my present lover.
9th. That as he is not respected by his wife, I shall now be able to
separate him from her.
10th. That the friend of this man loves my rival, who hates me
cordially; I shall, therefore, by this means separate the friend from
his mistress.
11th. And lastly, I shall bring discredit upon him by bringing him back
to me, thus showing the fickleness of his mind.
When a courtesan is resolved to take up again with a former lover, her
Pithamurda and other servants should tell him that his former expulsion
from the woman's house was caused by the wickedness of her mother; that
the woman loved him just as much as ever at that time, but could not
help the occurrence on account of her deference to her mother's will;
that she hated the union of her present lover, and disliked him
excessively. In addition to this, they should create confidence in his
mind by speaking to him of her former love for him, and should allude to
the mark of that love that she has ever remembered. This mark of her
love should be connected with some kind of pleasure that may have been
practised by him, such as his way of kissing her, or manner of having
connection with her.
Thus end the ways of bringing about a re-union with a former lover.
When a woman has to choose between two lovers, one of whom was formerly
united with her, while the other is a stranger, the Acharyas (sages) are
of opinion that the first one is preferable, because his disposition and
character being already known by previous careful observation, he can be
easily pleased and satisfied; but Vatsyayana thinks that a former lover,
having already spent a great deal of his wealth, is not able or willing
to give much money again, and is not, therefore, to be relied upon so
much as a stranger. Particular cases may, however, arise differing from
this general rule on account of the different natures of men.
There are also verses on the subject as follows:
Re-union with a former lover may be desirable so as to separate some
particular woman from some particular man, or some particular man from
some particular woman, or to have a certain effect upon the present
lover.
When a man is excessively attached to a woman, he is afraid of her
coming into contact with other men; he does not then regard or notice
her faults; and he gives her much wealth through fear of her leaving
him.
A courtesan should be agreeable to the man who is attached to her, and
despise the man who does not care for her. If while she is living with
one man a messenger comes to her from some other man, she may either
refuse to listen to any negotiations on his part, or appoint a fixed
time for him to visit her, but she should not leave the man who may be
living with her and who may be attached to her.
A wise woman should only renew her connection with a former lover if
she is satisfied that good fortune, gain, love, and friendship, are
likely to be the result of such a re-union.
CHAPTER V.
OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF GAIN.
When a courtesan is able to realize much money every day, by reason of
many customers, she should not confine herself to a single lover; under
such circumstances, she should fix her rate for one night, after
considering the place, the season, and the condition of the people, and
having regard to her own good qualities and good looks, and after
comparing her rates with those of other courtesans. She can inform her
lovers, and friends, and acquaintances about these charges. If, however,
she can obtain a great gain from a single lover, she may resort to him
alone, and live with him like a wife.
Now, the Sages are of opinion that when a courtesan has the chance of an
equal gain from two lovers at the same time, a preference should be
given to the one who would give her the kind of thing which she wants.
But Vatsyayana says that the preference should be given to the one who
gives her gold, because it cannot be taken back like some other things,
it can be easily received, and is also the means of procuring anything
that may be wished for. Of such things as gold, silver, copper, bell
metal, iron, pots, furniture, beds, upper garments, under vestments,
fragrant substances, vessels made of gourds, ghee, oil, corn, cattle,
and other things of a like nature, the first, viz., gold, is superior to
all the others.
When the same labour is required to gain any two lovers, or when the
same kind of thing is to be got from each of them, the choice should be
made by the advice of a friend, or it may be made from their personal
qualities, or from the signs of good or bad fortune that may be
connected with them.
When there are two lovers, one of whom is attached to the courtesan, and
the other is simply very generous, the Sages say that the preference
should be given to the generous lover, but Vatsyayana is of opinion that
the one who is really attached to the courtesan should be preferred,
because he can be made to be generous, even as a miser gives money if he
becomes fond of a woman, but a man who is simply generous cannot be made
to love with real attachment. But among those who are attached to her,
if there is one who is poor, and one who is rich, the preference is of
course to be given to the latter.
When there are two lovers, one of whom is generous, and the other ready
to do any service for the courtesan, some Sages say that the one who is
ready to do the service should be preferred, but Vatsyayana is of
opinion that a man who does a service thinks that he has gained his
object when he has done something once, but a generous man does not care
for what he has given before. Even here the choice should be guided by
the likelihood of the future good to be derived from her union with
either of them.
When one of the two lovers is grateful, and the other liberal, some
Sages say that the liberal one should be preferred, but Vatsyayana is of
opinion that the former should be chosen, because liberal men are
generally haughty, plain spoken, and wanting in consideration towards
others. Even though these liberal men have been on friendly terms for a
long time, yet if they see any fault in the courtesan, or are told lies
about her by some other women, they do not care for past services, but
leave abruptly. On the other hand the grateful man does not at once
break off from her, on account of a regard for the pains she may have
taken to please him. In this case also the choice is to be guided with
respect to what may happen in future.
When an occasion for complying with the request of a friend, and a
chance of getting money come together, the Sages say that the chance of
getting money should be preferred. But Vatsyayana thinks that the money
can be obtained to-morrow as well as to-day, but if the request of a
friend be not at once complied with, he may become disaffected. Even
here, in making the choice, regard must be paid to future good fortune.
On such an occasion, however, the courtesan might pacify her friend by
pretending to have some work to do, and telling him that his request
will be complied with next day, and in this way secure the chance of
getting the money that has been offered her.
When the chance of getting money, and the chance of avoiding some
disaster come at the same time, the Sages are of opinion that the chance
of getting money should be preferred, but Vatsyayana says that money has
only a limited importance, while a disaster that is once averted may
never occur again. Here, however, the choice should be guided by the
greatness or smallness of the disaster.
The gains of the wealthiest and best kind of courtesans are to be spent
as follows:
Building temples, tanks, and gardens; giving a thousand cows to
different Brahmans; carrying on the worship of the Gods, and celebrating
festivals in their honour; and, lastly, performing such vows as may be
within their means.
The gains of other courtesans are to be spent as follows:
Having a white dress to wear every day; getting sufficient food and
drink to satisfy hunger and thirst; eating daily a perfumed Tambula,
_i.e._, a mixture of betel nut and betel leaves; and wearing ornaments
gilt with gold. The Sages say that these represent the gains of all the
middle and lower classes of courtesans, but Vatsyayana is of opinion
that their gains cannot be calculated, or fixed in any way, as these
depend on the influence of the place, the customs of the people, their
own appearance, and many other things.
When a courtesan wants to keep some particular man from some other
woman; or wants to get him away from some woman to whom he may be
attached; or to deprive some woman of the gains realized by her from
him; or if she thinks that she would raise her position; or enjoy some
great good fortune; or become desirable to all men by uniting herself
with this man; or if she wishes to get his assistance in averting some
misfortune; or is really attached to him and loves him; or wishes to
injure somebody through his means; or has regard to some former favour
conferred upon her by him; or wishes to be united with him merely from
desire; or any of the above reasons, she should agree to take from him
only a small sum of money in a friendly way.
When a courtesan intends to abandon a particular lover, and take up with
another one; or when she has reason to believe that her lover will
shortly leave her, and return to his wives; or that having squandered
all his money, and became penniless, his guardian, or master, or father
would come and take him away; or that her lover is about to lose his
position, or lastly, that he is of a very fickle mind, she should, under
any of these circumstances, endeavour to get as much money as she can
from him as soon as possible.
On the other hand, when the courtesan thinks that her lover is about to
receive valuable presents; or get a place of authority from the King; or
be near the time of inheriting a fortune; or that his ship would soon
arrive laden with merchandise; or that he has large stocks of corn and
other commodities; or that if anything was done for him it would not be
done in vain; or that he is always true to his word; then should she
have regard to her future welfare, and live with the man like a wife.
There are also verses on the subject as follows:
In considering her present gains, and her future welfare, a courtesan
should avoid such persons as have gained their means of subsistence with
very great difficulty, as also those who have become selfish and
hard-hearted by becoming the favourites of Kings.
She should make every endeavour to unite herself with prosperous and
well-to-do people, and with those whom it is dangerous to avoid, or to
slight in any way. Even at some cost to herself she should become
acquainted with energetic and liberal-minded men, who when pleased would
give her a large sum of money, even for very little service, or for some
small thing.
CHAPTER VI.
OF GAINS AND LOSSES; ATTENDANT GAINS AND LOSSES; AND DOUBTS; AS ALSO OF
THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF COURTESANS.
It sometimes happens that while gains are being sought for, or expected
to be realised, that losses only are the result of our efforts, the
causes of these losses are:
Weakness of intellect.
Excessive love.
Excessive pride.
Excessive self conceit.
Excessive simplicity.
Excessive confidence.
Excessive anger.
Carelessness.
Recklessness.
Influence of evil genius.
Accidental circumstances.
The results of these losses are:
Expense incurred without any result.
Destruction of future good fortune.
Stoppage of gains about to be realized.
Loss of what is already obtained.
Acquisition of a sour temper.
Becoming unaimiable to every body.
Injury to health.
Loss of hair and other accidents.
Now gain is of three kinds, viz.: gain of wealth, gain of religious
merit, and gain of pleasure; and similarly, loss is of three kinds,
viz.: loss of wealth, loss of religious merit, and loss of pleasure. At
the time when gains are sought for, if other gains come along with them,
these are called attendant gains. When gain is uncertain, the doubt of
its being a gain is called a simple doubt. When there is a doubt
whether either of two things will happen or not, it is called a mixed
doubt. If while one thing is being done two results take place, it is
called a combination of two results, and if several results follow from
the same action, it is called a combination of results on every side.
We shall now give examples of the above.
As already stated, gain is of three kinds, and loss, which is opposed to
gain, is also of three kinds.
(a). When by living with a great man a courtesan acquires present
wealth, and in addition to this becomes acquainted with other people,
and thus obtains a chance of future fortune, and an accession of wealth,
and becomes desirable to all, this is called a gain of wealth attended
by other gain.
(b). When by living with a man a courtesan simply gets money, this is
called a gain of wealth not attended by any other gain.
(c). When a courtesan receives money from other people besides her
lover, the results are: the chance of the loss of future good from her
present lover; the chance of disaffection of a man securely attached to
her; the hatred of all; and the chance of a union with some low person,
tending to destroy her future good. This gain is called a gain of wealth
attended by losses.
(d). When a courtesan, at her own expense, and without any results in
the shape of gain, has connected with a great man, or an avaricious
minister, for the sake of diverting some misfortune, or removing some
cause that may be threatening the destruction of a great gain, this loss
is said to be a loss of wealth attended by gains of the future good
which it may bring about.
(e). When a courtesan is kind, even at her own expense, to a man who is
very stingy, or to a man proud of his looks, or to an ungrateful man
skilled in gaining the heart of others, without any good resulting from
these connections to her in the end, this loss is called a loss of
wealth not attended by any gain.
(f). When a courtesan is kind to any such man as described above, but
who in addition are favourites of the King, and moreover cruel and
powerful, without any good result in the end, and with a chance of her
being turned away at any moment, this loss is called a loss of wealth
attended by other losses.
In this way gains and losses, and attendant gains and losses in
religious merit and pleasures may become known to the reader, and
combinations of all of them may also be made.
Thus end the remarks on gains and losses, and attendant gains and
losses.
In the next place we come to doubts, which are again of three kinds,
viz.: doubts about wealth, doubts about religious merit, and doubts
about pleasures.
The following are examples.
(a). When a courtesan is not certain how much a man may give her, or
spend upon her, this is called a doubt about wealth.
(b). When a courtesan feels doubtful whether she is right in entirely
abandoning a lover from whom she is unable to get money, she having
taken all his wealth from him in the first instance, this doubt is
called a doubt about religious merit.
(c). When a courtesan is unable to get hold of a lover to her liking,
and is uncertain whether she will derive any pleasure from a person
surrounded by his family, or from a low person, this is called a doubt
about pleasure.
(d). When a courtesan is uncertain whether some powerful but low
principled fellow would cause loss to her on account of her not being
civil to him, this is called a doubt about the loss of wealth.
(e). When a courtesan feels doubtful whether she would lose religious
merit by abandoning a man who is attached to her without giving him the
slightest favour, and thereby causing him unhappiness in this world and
the next,[76] this doubt is called a doubt about the loss of a religious
merit.
(f). When a courtesan is uncertain as to whether she might create
disaffection by speaking out, and revealing her love and thus not get
her desire satisfied, this is called a doubt about the loss of pleasure.
Thus end the remarks on doubts.
_Mixed Doubts_.
(a). The intercourse or connection with a stranger, whose disposition is
unknown, and who may have been introduced by a lover, or by one who
possessed authority, may be productive either of gain or loss, and
therefore this is called a mixed doubt about the gain and loss of
wealth.
(b). When a courtesan is requested by a friend, or is impelled by pity
to have intercourse with a learned Brahman, a religious student, a
sacrificer, a devotee, or an ascetic who may have all fallen in love
with her, and who may be consequently at the point of death, by doing
this she might either gain or lose religious merit, and therefore this
is called a mixed doubt about the gain and loss of religious merit.
(c). If a courtesan relies solely upon the report of other people (_i.e._,
hearsay) about a man, and goes to him without ascertaining herself
whether he possesses good qualities or not, she may either gain or lose
pleasure in proportion as he may be good or bad, and therefore this is
called a mixed doubt about the gain and loss of pleasure.
Uddalika has described the gains and losses on both sides as follows.
(a). If, when living with a lover, a courtesan gets both wealth and
pleasure from him, it is called a gain on both sides.
(b). When a courtesan lives with a lover at her own expense without
getting any profit out of it, and the lover even takes back from her
what he may have formerly given her, it is called a loss on both sides.
(c). When a courtesan is uncertain whether a new acquaintance would
become attached to her, and, moreover, if he became attached to her,
whether he would give her any thing, it is then called a doubt on both
sides about gains.
(d). When a courtesan is uncertain whether a former enemy, if made up by
her at her own expense, would do her some injury on account of his
grudge against her; or, if becoming attached to her, would take away
angrily from her any thing that he may have given to her, this is called
a doubt on both sides about loss.
Babhravya has described the gains and losses on both sides as follows.
(a). When a courtesan can get money from a man whom she may go to see,
and also money from a man whom she may not go to see, this is called a
gain on both sides.
(b). When a courtesan has to incur further expense if she goes to see a
man, and yet runs the risk of incurring an irremediable loss if she does
not go to see him, this is called a loss on both sides.
(c). When a courtesan is uncertain, whether a particular man would give
her anything on her going to see him, without incurring expense on her
part, or whether on her neglecting him another man would give her
something, this is called a doubt on both sides about gain.
(d.) When a courtesan is uncertain, whether, on going at her own expense
to see an old enemy, he would take back from her what he may have given
her, or whether by her not going to see him he would cause some disaster
to fall upon her, this is called a doubt on both sides about loss.
By combining the above, the following six kinds of mixed results are
produced, viz.:
(a). Gain on one side, and loss on the other.
(b). Gain on one side, and doubt of gain on the other.
(c). Gain on one side, and doubt of loss on the other.
(d). Loss on one side, and doubt of gain on the other.
(e). Doubt of gain on one side, and doubt of loss on the other.
(f). Doubt of loss on one side, and loss on the other.
A courtesan, having considered all the above things, and taken council
with her friends, should act so as to acquire gain, the chances of great
gain, and the warding off of any great disaster. Religious merit and
pleasure should also be formed into separate combinations like those of
wealth, and then all should be combined with each other, so as to form
new combinations.
When a courtesan consorts with men she should cause each of them to give
her money as well as pleasure. At particular times, such as the Spring
Festivals, etc., she should make her mother announce to the various men,
that on a certain day her daughter would remain with the man who would
gratify such and such a desire of hers.
When young men approach her with delight, she should think of what she
may accomplish through them.
The combination of gains and losses on all sides are: gain on one side,
and loss on all others; loss on one side and gain on all others; gain on
all sides, loss on all sides.
A courtesan should also consider doubts about gain and doubts about loss
with reference both to wealth, religious merit, and pleasure.
Thus ends the consideration of gain, loss, attendant gains, attendant
losses, and doubts.
The different kinds of courtesans are:
A bawd.
A female attendant.
An unchaste woman.
A dancing girl.
A female artisan.
A woman who has left her family.
A woman living on her beauty.
And, finally, a regular courtesan.
All the above kinds of courtesans are acquainted with various kinds of
men, and should consider the ways of getting money from them, of
pleasing them, of separating themselves from them, and of re-uniting
with them. They should also take into consideration particular gains and
losses, attendant gains and losses, and doubts in accordance with their
several conditions.
Thus end the considerations of courtesans.
There are also two verses on the subject as follows:
Men want pleasure, while women want money, and therefore this Part,
which treats of the means of gaining wealth, should be studied.
There are some women who seek for love, and there are others who seek
for money; for the former the ways of love are told in previous portions
of this work, while the ways of getting money, as practised by
courtesans, are described in this Part.

are said to go to the world of the Manes, and not direct to the Supreme
Spirit.]
=END OF PART VI.=
PART VII.
ABOUT THE MEANS OF ATTRACTING OTHERS TO YOURSELF.
CHAPTER I.
ON PERSONAL ADORNMENT; ON SUBJUGATING THE HEARTS OF OTHERS; AND ON TONIC
MEDICINES.
When a person fails to obtain the object of his desires by any of the
ways previously related, he should then have recourse to other ways of
attracting others to himself.
Now, good looks, good qualities, youth, and liberality are the chief and
most natural means of making a person agreeable in the eyes of others.
But in the absence of these a man or a woman must have resort to
artificial means, or to art, and the following are some recipes that may
be found useful.
(a). An ointment made of the tabernamontana coronaria, the costus
speciosus or arabicus, and the flacourtia cataphracta, can be used as an
unguent of adornment.
(b). If a fine powder is made of the above plants, and applied to the
wick of a lamp, which is made to burn with the oil of blue vitrol, the
black pigment or lamp black produced therefrom, when applied to the
eye-lashes, has the effect of making a person look lovely.
(c). The oil of the hog weed, the echites putescens, the sarina plant,
the yellow amaranth, and the leaf of the nymph√¶, if applied to the body,
has the same effect.
(d). A black pigment from the same plants produce a similar effect.
(e). By eating the powder of the nelumbrium speciosum, the blue lotus,
and the mesna roxburghii, with ghee and honey, a man becomes lovely in
the eyes of others.
(f). The above things, together with the tabernamontana coronaria, and
the xanthochymus pictorius, if used as an ointment, produce the same
results.
(g). If the bone of a peacock or of an hyena be covered with gold, and
tied on the right hand, it makes a man lovely in the eyes of other
people.
(h). In the same way, if a bead, made of the seed of the jujube, or of
the conch shell, be enchanted by the incantations mentioned in the
Atharvana Veda, or by the incantations of those well skilled in the
science of magic, and tied on the hand, it produces the same result as
described above.
(i). When a female attendant arrives at the age of puberty, her master
should keep her secluded, and when men ardently desire her on account of
her seclusion, and on account of the difficulty of approaching her, he
should then bestow her hand on such a person as may endow her with
wealth and happiness.
This is a means of increasing the loveliness of a person in the eyes of
others.
In the same way, when the daughter of a courtesan arrives at the age of
puberty, the mother should get together a lot of young men of the same
age, disposition, and knowledge as her daughter, and tell them that she
would give her in marriage to the person who would give her presents of
a particular kind.
After this the daughter should be kept in seclusion as far as possible,
and the mother should give her in marriage to the man who may be ready
to give her the presents agreed upon. If the mother is unable to get so
much out of the man, she should show some of her own things as having
been given to the daughter by the bridegroom.
Or, the mother may allow her daughter to be married to the man
privately, as if she was ignorant of the whole affair, and then
pretending that it has come to her knowledge, she may give her consent
to the union.
The daughter, too, should make herself attractive to the sons of wealthy
citizens, unknown to her mother, and make them attached to her, and for
this purpose should meet them at the time of learning to sing, and in
places where music is played, and at the houses of other people, and
then request her mother, through a female friend, or servant, to be
allowed to unite herself to the man who is most agreeable to her.[77]
When the daughter of a courtesan is thus given to a man, the ties of
marriage should be observed for one year, and after that she may do what
she likes. But even after the end of the year, when otherwise engaged,
if she should be now and then invited by her first husband to come and
see him, she should put aside her present gain, and go to him for the
night.
Such is the mode of temporary marriage among courtesans, and of
increasing their loveliness, and their value in the eyes of others. What
has been said about them should also be understood to apply to the
daughters of dancing women, whose mothers should give them only to such
persons as are likely to become useful to them in various ways.
Thus end the ways of making oneself lovely in the eyes of others.
(a). If a man, after anointing his lingam with a mixture of the powders
of the white thorn apple, the long pepper, and the black pepper, and
honey, engages in sexual union with a woman, he makes her subject to his
will.
(b). The application of a mixture of the leaf of the plant vatodbhranta,
of the flowers thrown on a human corpse when carried out to be burnt,
and the powder of the bones of the peacock, and of the jiwanjiva bird,
produces the same effect.
(c). The remains of a kite who has died a natural death, ground into
powder, and mixed with cowach and honey, has also the same effect.
(d). Anointing oneself with an ointment made of the plant emblica
myrabolans has the power of subjecting women to one's will.
(e). If a man cuts into small pieces the sprouts of the vajnasunhi
plant, and dips them into a mixture of red arsenic and sulphur, and then
dries them seven times, and applies this powder mixed with honey to his
lingam, he can subjugate a woman to his will directly that he has had
sexual union with her, or, if, by burning these very sprouts at night
and looking at the smoke, he sees a golden moon behind, he will then be
successful with any woman; or if he throws some of the powder of these
same sprouts mixed with the excrement of a monkey upon a maiden, she
will not be given in marriage to any body else.
(f). If pieces of the arris root are dressed with the oil of the mango,
and placed for six months in a hole made in the trunk of the sisu tree,
and are then taken out and made up into an ointment, and applied to the
lingam, this is said to serve as the means of subjugating women.
(g). If the bone of a camel is dipped into the juice of the plant
eclipta prostata, and then burnt, and the black pigment produced from
its ashes is placed in a box also made of the bone of a camel, and
applied together with antimony to the eye lashes with a pencil also made
of the bone of a camel, then that pigment is said to be very pure, and
wholesome for the eyes, and serves as a means of subjugating others to
the person who uses it. The same effect can be produced by black pigment
made of the bones of hawks, vultures, and peacocks.
Thus end the ways of subjugating others to one's own will.
Now the means of increasing sexual vigour are as follows:
(a). A man obtains sexual vigour by drinking milk mixed with sugar, the
root of the uchchata plant, the piper chaba, and liquorice.
(b). Drinking milk mixed with sugar, and having the testicle of a ram or
a goat boiled in it, is also productive of vigour.
(c). The drinking of the juice of the hedysarum gangeticum, the kuili,
and the kshirika plant mixed with milk, produces the same effect.
(d). The seed of the long pepper along with the seeds of the sanseviera
roxburghiana, and the hedysarum gangeticum plant, all pounded together,
and mixed with milk, is productive of a similar result.
(e). According to ancient authors, if a man pounds the seeds or roots of
the trapa bispinosa, the kasurika, the tuscan jasmine, and liquorice,
together with the kshirakapoli (a kind of onion), and puts the powder
into milk mixed with sugar and ghee, and having boiled the whole mixture
on a moderate fire, drinks the paste so formed, he will be able to enjoy
innumerable women.
(f). In the same way, if a man mixes rice with the eggs of the sparrow,
and having boiled this in milk, adds to it ghee and honey, and drinks as
much of it as necessary, this will produce the same effect.
(g). If a man takes the outer covering of sesamum seeds, and soaks them
with the eggs of sparrows, and then, having boiled them in milk, mixed
with sugar and ghee, along with the fruits of the trapa bispinosa and
the kasurika plant, and adding to it the flour of wheat and beans, and
then drinks this composition, he is said to be able to enjoy many women.
(h). If ghee, honey, sugar, and liquorice in equal quantities, the juice
of the fennel plant, and milk are mixed together, this nectar-like
composition is said to be holy, and provocative of sexual vigour, a
preservative of life, and sweet to the taste.
(i). The drinking of a paste composed of the asparagus racemosus, the
shvadaushtra plant, the guduchi plant, the long pepper, and liquorice,
boiled in milk, honey, and ghee, in the spring, is said to have the same
effect as the above.
(j). Boiling the asparagus racemosus, and the shvadaushtra plant, along
with the pounded fruits of the premna spinosa in water, and drinking the
same, is said to act in the same way.
(k). Drinking boiled ghee, or clarified butter in the morning during the
spring season, is said to be beneficial to health and strength, and
agreeable to the taste.
(l). If the powder of the seed of the shvadaushtra plant and the flower
of barley are mixed together in equal parts, and a portion of it, _i.e._,
two palas in weight, is eaten every morning on getting up, it has the
same effect as the preceding recipe.
There are also verses on the subject as follows:
The means[78] of producing love and sexual vigour should be learnt from
the science of medicine, from the Vedas, from those who are learned in
the arts of magic, and from confidential relatives. No means should be
tried which are doubtful in their effects, which are likely to cause
injury to the body, which involve the death of animals, and which bring
us in contact with impure things. Such means should only be used as are
holy, acknowledged to be good, and approved of by Brahmans, and
friends.

give their daughters temporarily in marriage when they come of age, and
after they have received an education in the Kama Sutra and other arts.

Hindoo stories, collected and collated by Anaryan. W. H. Allen and Co.,

themselves about aphrodisiacs. The following note on the subject is
taken from page 29 of a translation of the Hindoo Art of Love, otherwise

3 and 5:--Most Eastern treatises divide aphrodisiacs into two different
kinds: 1., the mechanical or natural, such as scarification,
flagellation, etc.; and 2., the medicinal or artificial. To the former
belong the application of insects, as is practised by some savage races;
and all orientalists will remember the tale of the old Brahman, whose
young wife insisted upon his being again stung by a wasp.]
CHAPTER II.
OF THE WAYS OF EXCITING DESIRE, AND MISCELLANEOUS EXPERIMENTS, AND
RECIPES.
If a man is unable to satisfy a Hastini, or elephant woman, he should
have recourse to various means to excite her passion. At the
commencement he should rub her yoni with his hand or fingers, and not
begin to have intercourse with her until she becomes excited, or
experiences pleasure. This is one way of exciting a woman.
Or, he may make use of certain Apadravyas, or things which are put on or
around the lingam to supplement its length or its thickness, so as to
fit it to the yoni. In the opinion of Babhravya, these Apadravyas should
be made of gold, silver, copper, iron, ivory, buffalo's horn, various
kinds of wood, tin or lead, and should be soft, cool, provocative of
sexual vigour, and well fitted to serve the intended purpose.
Vatsyayana, however, says that they may be made according to the natural
liking of each individual.
The following are the different kinds of Apadravyas.
(1). The armlet (Valaya) should be of the same size as the lingam, and
should have its outer surface made rough with globules.
(2). The couple (Sanghati) is formed of two armlets.
(3). The bracelet (Chudaka) is made by joining three or more armlets,
until they come up to the required length of the lingam.
(4). The single bracelet is formed by wrapping a single wire around
the lingam, according to its dimensions.
(5). The Kantuka or Jalaka is a tube open at both ends, with a hole
through it, outwardly rough and studded with soft globules, and made to
fit the side of the yoni, and tied to the waist.
When such a thing cannot be obtained, then a tube made of the wood
apple, or tubular stalk of the bottle gourd, or a reed made soft with
oil and extracts of plants, and tied to the waist with strings, may be
made use of, as also a row of soft pieces of wood tied together.
The above are the things that can be used in connection with or in the
place of the lingam.
The people of the southern countries think that true sexual pleasure
cannot be obtained without perforating the lingam, and they therefore
cause it to be pierced like the lobes of the ears of an infant pierced
for earrings.
Now, when a young man perforates his lingam he should pierce it with a
sharp instrument, and then stand in water so long as the blood continues
to flow. At night he should engage in sexual intercourse, even with
vigour, so as to clean the hole. After this he should continue to wash
the hole with decoctions, and increase the size by putting into it small
pieces of cane, and the wrightia antidysenterica, and thus gradually
enlarging the orifice. It may also be washed with liquorice mixed with
honey, and the size of the hole increased by the fruit stalks of the
sima-patra plant. The hole should be annointed with a small quantity of
oil.
In the hole made in the lingam a man may put Apadravyas of various
forms, such as the round, the round on one side, the wooden
mortar, the flower, the armlet, the bone of the heron, the goad
of the elephant, the collection of eight balls, the lock of hair,
the place where four roads meet, and other things named according to
their forms and means of using them. All these Apadravyas should be
rough on the outside according to their requirements.
The ways of enlarging the lingam must be now related.
When a man wishes to enlarge his lingam, he should rub it with the
bristles of certain insects that live in trees, and then, after rubbing
it for ten nights with oils, he should again rub it with the bristles as
before. By continuing to do this a swelling will be gradually produced
in the lingam, and he should then lie on a cot, and cause his lingam to
hang down through a hole in the cot. After this he should take away all
the pain from the swelling by using cool concoctions. The swelling,
which is called Suka, and is often brought about among the people of
the Dravida country, lasts for life.
If the lingam is rubbed with the following things, viz., the plant
physalis flexuosa, the shavara-kandaka plant, the jalasuka plant, the
fruit of the egg plant, the butter of a she buffalo, the hastri-charma
plant, and the juice of the vajra-rasa plant, a swelling lasting for one
month will be produced.
By rubbing it with oil boiled in the concoctions of the above things,
the same effect will be produced, but lasting for six months.
The enlargement of the lingam is also effected by rubbing it or
moistening it with oil boiled on a moderate fire along with the seeds of
the pomegranate, and the cucumber, the juices of the valuka plant, the
hasti-charma plant, and the egg-plant.
In addition to the above, other means may be learnt from experienced and
confidential persons.
The miscellaneous experiments and recipes are as follows:
(a). If a man mixes the powder of the milk hedge plant, and the kantaka
plant with the excrement of a monkey, and the powdered root of the
lanjalalika plant, and throws this mixture on a woman, she will not love
any body else afterwards.
(b). If a man thickens the juice of the fruits of the cassia fistula,
and the eugenia jambolana by mixing them with the powder of the soma
plant, the vernonia anthelmintica, the eclipta prostata, and the
lohopa-jihirka, and applies this composition to the yoni of a woman, and
then has sexual intercourse with her, his love for her will be
destroyed.
(c). The same effect is produced if a man has connection with a woman
who has bathed in the butter-milk of a she-buffalo mixed with the
powders of the gopalika plant, the banu-padika plant, and the yellow
amaranth.
(d). An ointment made of the flowers of the nauclea cadamba, the hog
plum, and the eugenia jambolana, and used by a woman, causes her to be
disliked by her husband.
(e). Garlands made of the above flowers, when worn by the woman, produce
the same effect.
(f). An ointment made of the fruit of the asteracantha longifolia
(kokilaksha) will contract the yoni of a Hastini or elephant woman, and
this contraction lasts for one night.
(g). An ointment made by pounding the roots of the nelumbrium speciosum,
and of the blue lotus, and the powder of the plant physalis flexuosa
mixed with ghee and honey, will enlarge the yoni of the Mrigi or deer
woman.
(h). An ointment made of the fruit of the emblica myrabolans soaked in
the milky juice of the milk hedge plant, of the soma plant, the
calotropis gigantea, and the juice of the fruit of the vernonia
anthelmintica, will make the hair white.
(i). The juice of the roots of the madayantaka plant, the yellow
amaranth, the anjanika plant, the clitoria ternateea, and the
shlakshnaparni plant, used as a lotion, will make the hair grow.
(j). An ointment made by boiling the above roots in oil, and rubbed in,
will make the hair black, and will also gradually restore hair that has
fallen off.
(k) If lac is saturated seven times in the sweat of the testicle of a
white horse, and applied to a red lip, the lip will become white.
(l). The colour of the lips can be regained by means of the madayantika
and other plants mentioned above under (i).
(m). A woman who hears a man playing on a reed pipe which has been
dressed with the juices of the bahupadika plant, the tabernamontana
coronaria, the costus speciosus or arabicus, the pinus deodora, the
euphorbia antiquorum, the vajra and the kantaka plant, becomes his
slave.
(n). If food be mixed with the fruit of the thorn apple (Dathura) it
causes intoxication.
(o). If water be mixed with oil and the ashes of any kind of grass
except the kusha grass, it becomes the colour of milk.
(p). If yellow myrabolans, the hog plum, the shrawana plant, and the
priyangu plant be all pounded together, and applied to iron pots, these
pots become red.
(q). If a lamp, trimmed with oil extracted from the shrawana and
priyangn plants, its wick being made of cloth and the slough of the
skins of snakes, is lighted, and long pieces of wood placed near it,
those pieces of wood will resemble so many snakes.
(r). Drinking the milk of a white cow who has a white calf at her feet
is auspicious, produces fame, and preserves life.
(s). The blessings of venerable Brahmans, well propitiated, have the
same effect.
There are also some verses in conclusion:
Thus have I written in a few words the 'Science of love,' after reading
the texts of ancient authors, and following the ways of enjoyment
mentioned in them.
He who is acquainted with the true principles of this science pays
regard to Dharma, Artha, Kama, and to his own experiences, as well as to
the teachings of others, and does not act simply on the dictates of his
own desire. As for the errors in the science of love which I have
mentioned in this work, on my own authority as an author, I have,
immediately after mentioning them, carefully censured and prohibited
them.
An act is never looked upon with indulgence for the simple reason that
it is authorised by the science, because it ought to be remembered that
it is the intention of the science, that the rules which it contains
should only be acted upon in particular cases. After reading and
considering the works of Babhravya and other ancient authors, and
thinking over the meaning of the rules given by them, the Kama Sutra was
composed, according to the precepts of Holy Writ, for the benefit of the
world, by Vatsyayana, while leading the life of a religious student, and
wholly engaged in the contemplation of the Deity.
This work is not intended to be used merely as an instrument for
satisfying our desires. A person, acquainted with the true principles of
this science, and who preserves his Dharma, Artha, and Kama, and has
regard for the practices of the people, is sure to obtain the mastery
over his senses.
In short, an intelligent and prudent person, attending to Dharma and
Artha, and attending to Kama also, without becoming the slave of his
passions, obtains success in everything that he may undertake.
=END OF PART VII.=
CONCLUDING REMARKS.
Thus ends, in seven parts, the Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana, which might
otherwise be called a treatise on men and women, their mutual
relationship, and connection with each other.
It is a work that should be studied by all, both old and young; the
former will find in it real truths, gathered by experience, and already
tested by themselves, while the latter will derive the great advantage
of learning things, which some perhaps may otherwise never learn at all,
or which they may only learn when it is too late (too late those
immortal words of Mirabeau) to profit by the learning.
It can also be fairly commended to the student of social science and of
humanity, and above all to the student of those early ideas, which have
gradually filtered down through the sands of time, and which seem to
prove that the human nature of to-day is much the same as the human
nature of the long ago.
It has been said of Balzac [the great, if not the greatest of French
novelists] that he seemed to have inherited a natural and intuitive
perception of the feelings of men and women, and has described them with
an analysis worthy of a man of science. The author of the present work
must also have had a considerable knowledge of the humanities. Many of
his remarks are so full of simplicity and truth, that they have stood
the test of time, and stand out still as clear and true as when they
were first written, some eighteen hundred years ago.
As a collection of facts, told in plain and simple language, it must be
remembered that in those early days there was apparently no idea of
embellishing the work, either with a literary style, a flow of
language, or a quantity of superfluous padding. The author tells the
world what he knows in very concise language, without any attempt to
produce an interesting story. From his facts how many novels could be
written! Indeed much of the matter contained in parts III. IV. V. and
VI., has formed the basis of many of the stories and the tales of past
centuries.
There will be found in part VII., some curious recipes. Many of them
appear to be as primitive as the book itself, but in later works of the
same nature these recipes and prescriptions appear to have increased,
both as regards quality and quantity. In the Anunga Runga or The Stage
of Love, mentioned at page 5 of the Preface in Part I., there are found
no less than thirty-three different subjects for which one hundred and
thirty recipes and prescriptions are given.
As the details may be interesting, these subjects are described as
follows:
1. For hastening the paroxysm of the woman.
2. For delaying the organs of the man.
3. Aphrodisiacs.
4. For thickening and enlarging the lingam, rendering it sound and
strong, hard and lusty.
5. For narrowing and contracting the yoni.
6. For perfuming the yoni.
7. For removing and destroying the hair of the body.
8. For removing the sudden stopping of the monthly ailment.
9. For abating the immoderate appearance of the monthly ailment.
10. For purifying the womb.
11. For causing pregnancy.
12. For preventing miscarriage and other accidents.
13. For ensuring easy labour and ready deliverance.
14. For limiting the number of children.
15. For thickening and beautifying the hair.
16. For obtaining a good black colour to it.
17. For whitening and bleaching it.
18. For renewing it.
19. For clearing the skin of the face from eruptions that break out and
leave black spots upon it.
20. For removing the black colour of the epidermis.
21. For enlarging the breasts of women.
22. For raising and hardening pendulous breasts.
23. For giving a fragrance to the skin.
24. For removing the evil savour of perspiration.
25. For anointing the body after bathing.
26. For causing a pleasant smell to the breath.
27. Drugs and charms for the purposes of fascinating, overcoming, and
subduing either men or women.
28. Recipes for enabling a woman to attract and preserve her husband's
love.
29. Magical collyriums for winning love and friendship.
30. Prescriptions for reducing other persons to submission.
31. Philter pills, and other charms.
32. Fascinating incense, or fumigation.
33. Magical verses which have the power of fascination.
Of the one hundred and thirty recipes given, many of them are absurd,
but not more perhaps than many of the recipes and prescriptions in use
in Europe not so very long ago. Love-philters, charms, and herbal
remedies have been, in early days, as freely used in Europe as in Asia,
and doubtless some people believe in them still in many places.
And now, one word about the author of the work, the good old sage
Vatsyayana. It is much to be regretted that nothing can be discovered
about his life, his belongings, and his surroundings. At the end of Part
VII. he states that he wrote the work while leading the life of a
religious student [probably at Benares] and while wholly engaged in the
contemplation of the Deity. He must have arrived at a certain age at
that time, for throughout he gives us the benefit of his experience, and
of his opinions, and these bear the stamp of age rather than of youth;
indeed the work could hardly have been written by a young man.
In a beautiful verse of the Vedas of the Christians it has been said of
the peaceful dead, that they rest from their labours, and that their
works do follow them. Yes indeed, the works of men of genius do follow
them, and remain as a lasting treasure. And though there may be
disputes and discussions about the immortality of the body or the soul,
nobody can deny the immortality of genius, which ever remains as a
bright and guiding star to the struggling humanities of succeeding ages.
This work, then, which has stood the test of centuries, has placed
Vatsyayana among the immortals, and on This, and on Him no better elegy
or eulogy can be written than the following lines:
So long as lips shall kiss, and eyes shall see,
So long lives This, and This gives life to Thee.
CHAPTER I.
YOU don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of The
Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain't no matter.  That book was made
by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly.  There was things
which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth.  That is nothing.  I
never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt
Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary.  Aunt Polly--Tom's Aunt Polly, she
is--and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which
is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.
Now the way that the book winds up is this:  Tom and me found the money
that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich.  We got six
thousand dollars apiece--all gold.  It was an awful sight of money when
it was piled up.  Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out
at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year
round--more than a body could tell what to do with.  The Widow Douglas
she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was
rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular
and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn't stand
it no longer I lit out.  I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead
again, and was free and satisfied.  But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and
said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I
would go back to the widow and be respectable.  So I went back.
The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she
called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by
it. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn't do nothing but
sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up.  Well, then, the old thing
commenced again.  The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come
to time. When you got to the table you couldn't go right to eating, but
you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little
over the victuals, though there warn't really anything the matter with
them,--that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself.  In a
barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the
juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better.
After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the
Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and
by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so
then I didn't care no more about him, because I don't take no stock in
dead people.
Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me.  But she
wouldn't.  She said it was a mean practice and wasn't clean, and I must
try to not do it any more.  That is just the way with some people.  They
get down on a thing when they don't know nothing about it.  Here she was
a-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to anybody,
being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a
thing that had some good in it.  And she took snuff, too; of course that
was all right, because she done it herself.
Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on,
had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a
spelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then
the widow made her ease up.  I couldn't stood it much longer.  Then for
an hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety.  Miss Watson would say,
Don't put your feet up there, Huckleberry; and Don't scrunch up
like that, Huckleberry--set up straight; and pretty soon she would
say, Don't gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry--why don't you try to
behave?  Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished
I was there. She got mad then, but I didn't mean no harm.  All I wanted
was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn't particular.
She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn't say it for
the whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place.
Well, I couldn't see no advantage in going where she was going, so I
made up my mind I wouldn't try for it.  But I never said so, because it
would only make trouble, and wouldn't do no good.
Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good
place.  She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all
day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever.  So I didn't think
much of it. But I never said so.  I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer
would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight.  I was glad
about that, because I wanted him and me to be together.
Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome.
By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then
everybody was off to bed.  I went up to my room with a piece of candle,
and put it on the table.  Then I set down in a chair by the window and
tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn't no use.  I felt
so lonesome I most wished I was dead.  The stars were shining, and the
leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away
off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a
dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying
to whisper something to me, and I couldn't make out what it was, and so
it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods I heard
that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about
something that's on its mind and can't make itself understood, and so
can't rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night
grieving.  I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some
company.  Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I
flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it
was all shriveled up.  I didn't need anybody to tell me that that was
an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared
and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my
tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied
up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away.  But
I hadn't no confidence.  You do that when you've lost a horseshoe that
you've found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn't ever
heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you'd killed
a spider.
I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke;
for the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn't
know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town
go boom--boom--boom--twelve licks; and all still again--stiller than
ever. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the
trees--something was a stirring.  I set still and listened.  Directly I
could just barely hear a me-yow! me-yow! down there.  That was good!
Says I, me-yow! me-yow! as soft as I could, and then I put out the
light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed.  Then I slipped
down to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough,
there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.
CHAPTER II.
WE went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of
the widow's garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn't scrape our
heads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made
a noise.  We scrouched down and laid still.  Miss Watson's big nigger,
named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty
clear, because there was a light behind him.  He got up and stretched
his neck out about a minute, listening.  Then he says:
Who dah?
He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right
between us; we could a touched him, nearly.  Well, likely it was
minutes and minutes that there warn't a sound, and we all there so close
together.  There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I
dasn't scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back,
right between my shoulders.  Seemed like I'd die if I couldn't scratch.
Well, I've noticed that thing plenty times since.  If you are with
the quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain't
sleepy--if you are anywheres where it won't do for you to scratch, why
you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim
says:
Say, who is you?  Whar is you?  Dog my cats ef I didn' hear sumf'n.
Well, I know what I's gwyne to do:  I's gwyne to set down here and
listen tell I hears it agin.
So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom.  He leaned his back up
against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched
one of mine.  My nose begun to itch.  It itched till the tears come into
my eyes.  But I dasn't scratch.  Then it begun to itch on the inside.
Next I got to itching underneath.  I didn't know how I was going to set
still. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but
it seemed a sight longer than that.  I was itching in eleven different
places now.  I reckoned I couldn't stand it more'n a minute longer,
but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try.  Just then Jim begun
to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore--and then I was pretty soon
comfortable again.
Tom he made a sign to me--kind of a little noise with his mouth--and we
went creeping away on our hands and knees.  When we was ten foot off Tom
whispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun.  But I said
no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they'd find out I
warn't in. Then Tom said he hadn't got candles enough, and he would slip
in the kitchen and get some more.  I didn't want him to try.  I said Jim
might wake up and come.  But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there
and got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay.
Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do
Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands and knees, and play
something on him.  I waited, and it seemed a good while, everything was
so still and lonesome.
As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence,
and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of
the house.  Tom said he slipped Jim's hat off of his head and hung it
on a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn't wake.
Afterwards Jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance,
and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees again,
and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it.  And next time Jim told
it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every
time he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said they
rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back
was all over saddle-boils.  Jim was monstrous proud about it, and he
got so he wouldn't hardly notice the other niggers.  Niggers would come
miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any
nigger in that country.  Strange niggers would stand with their mouths
open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder.  Niggers is
always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but
whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things,
Jim would happen in and say, Hm!  What you know 'bout witches? and
that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat.  Jim always kept
that five-center piece round his neck with a string, and said it was a
charm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could
cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by
saying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it.
Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything they
had, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but they wouldn't touch
it, because the devil had had his hands on it.  Jim was most ruined for
a servant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil
and been rode by witches.
Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down
into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where
there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever
so fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and
awful still and grand.  We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and
Ben Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard.
So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half,
to the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.
We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the
secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest
part of the bushes.  Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our
hands and knees.  We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave
opened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked
under a wall where you wouldn't a noticed that there was a hole.  We
went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and
sweaty and cold, and there we stopped.  Tom says:
Now, we'll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer's Gang.
Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his name
in blood.
Everybody was willing.  So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had
wrote the oath on, and read it.  It swore every boy to stick to the
band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to
any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and
his family must do it, and he mustn't eat and he mustn't sleep till he
had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign
of the band. And nobody that didn't belong to the band could use that
mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he must be
killed.  And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he
must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and the
ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with
blood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on it
and be forgot forever.
Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got
it out of his own head.  He said, some of it, but the rest was out of
pirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned had
it.
Some thought it would be good to kill the _families_ of boys that told
the secrets.  Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil and wrote
it in. Then Ben Rogers says:
Here's Huck Finn, he hain't got no family; what you going to do 'bout
him?
Well, hain't he got a father? says Tom Sawyer.
Yes, he's got a father, but you can't never find him these days.  He
used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain't been seen
in these parts for a year or more.
They talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they
said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it
wouldn't be fair and square for the others.  Well, nobody could think of
anything to do--everybody was stumped, and set still.  I was most ready
to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss
Watson--they could kill her.  Everybody said:
Oh, she'll do.  That's all right.  Huck can come in.
Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with,
and I made my mark on the paper.
Now, says Ben Rogers, what's the line of business of this Gang?
Nothing only robbery and murder, Tom said.
But who are we going to rob?--houses, or cattle, or--
Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain't robbery; it's burglary,
says Tom Sawyer.  We ain't burglars.  That ain't no sort of style.  We
are highwaymen.  We stop stages and carriages on the road, with masks
on, and kill the people and take their watches and money.
Must we always kill the people?
Oh, certainly.  It's best.  Some authorities think different, but
mostly it's considered best to kill them--except some that you bring to
the cave here, and keep them till they're ransomed.
Ransomed?  What's that?
I don't know.  But that's what they do.  I've seen it in books; and so
of course that's what we've got to do.
But how can we do it if we don't know what it is?
Why, blame it all, we've _got_ to do it.  Don't I tell you it's in the
books?  Do you want to go to doing different from what's in the books,
and get things all muddled up?
Oh, that's all very fine to _say_, Tom Sawyer, but how in the nation
are these fellows going to be ransomed if we don't know how to do it
to them?--that's the thing I want to get at.  Now, what do you reckon it
is?
Well, I don't know.  But per'aps if we keep them till they're ransomed,
it means that we keep them till they're dead.
Now, that's something _like_.  That'll answer.  Why couldn't you said
that before?  We'll keep them till they're ransomed to death; and a
bothersome lot they'll be, too--eating up everything, and always trying
to get loose.
How you talk, Ben Rogers.  How can they get loose when there's a guard
over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?
A guard!  Well, that _is_ good.  So somebody's got to set up all night
and never get any sleep, just so as to watch them.  I think that's
foolishness. Why can't a body take a club and ransom them as soon as
they get here?
Because it ain't in the books so--that's why.  Now, Ben Rogers, do you
want to do things regular, or don't you?--that's the idea.  Don't you
reckon that the people that made the books knows what's the correct
thing to do?  Do you reckon _you_ can learn 'em anything?  Not by a good
deal. No, sir, we'll just go on and ransom them in the regular way.
All right.  I don't mind; but I say it's a fool way, anyhow.  Say, do
we kill the women, too?
Well, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldn't let on.  Kill
the women?  No; nobody ever saw anything in the books like that.  You
fetch them to the cave, and you're always as polite as pie to them;
and by and by they fall in love with you, and never want to go home any
more.
Well, if that's the way I'm agreed, but I don't take no stock in it.
Mighty soon we'll have the cave so cluttered up with women, and fellows
waiting to be ransomed, that there won't be no place for the robbers.
But go ahead, I ain't got nothing to say.
Little Tommy Barnes was asleep now, and when they waked him up he was
scared, and cried, and said he wanted to go home to his ma, and didn't
want to be a robber any more.
So they all made fun of him, and called him cry-baby, and that made him
mad, and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets.  But
Tom give him five cents to keep quiet, and said we would all go home and
meet next week, and rob somebody and kill some people.
Ben Rogers said he couldn't get out much, only Sundays, and so he wanted
to begin next Sunday; but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it
on Sunday, and that settled the thing.  They agreed to get together and
fix a day as soon as they could, and then we elected Tom Sawyer first
captain and Jo Harper second captain of the Gang, and so started home.
I clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was
breaking. My new clothes was all greased up and clayey, and I was
dog-tired.
CHAPTER III.
WELL, I got a good going-over in the morning from old Miss Watson on
account of my clothes; but the widow she didn't scold, but only cleaned
off the grease and clay, and looked so sorry that I thought I would
behave awhile if I could.  Then Miss Watson she took me in the closet
and prayed, but nothing come of it.  She told me to pray every day, and
whatever I asked for I would get it.  But it warn't so.  I tried it.
Once I got a fish-line, but no hooks.  It warn't any good to me without
hooks.  I tried for the hooks three or four times, but somehow I
couldn't make it work.  By and by, one day, I asked Miss Watson to
try for me, but she said I was a fool.  She never told me why, and I
couldn't make it out no way.
I set down one time back in the woods, and had a long think about it.
I says to myself, if a body can get anything they pray for, why don't
Deacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork?  Why can't the widow get
back her silver snuffbox that was stole?  Why can't Miss Watson fat up?
No, says I to my self, there ain't nothing in it.  I went and told the
widow about it, and she said the thing a body could get by praying for
it was spiritual gifts.  This was too many for me, but she told me
what she meant--I must help other people, and do everything I could for
other people, and look out for them all the time, and never think about
myself. This was including Miss Watson, as I took it.  I went out in the
woods and turned it over in my mind a long time, but I couldn't see no
advantage about it--except for the other people; so at last I reckoned
I wouldn't worry about it any more, but just let it go.  Sometimes the
widow would take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to make
a body's mouth water; but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold
and knock it all down again.  I judged I could see that there was two
Providences, and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the
widow's Providence, but if Miss Watson's got him there warn't no help
for him any more.  I thought it all out, and reckoned I would belong
to the widow's if he wanted me, though I couldn't make out how he was
a-going to be any better off then than what he was before, seeing I was
so ignorant, and so kind of low-down and ornery.
Pap he hadn't been seen for more than a year, and that was comfortable
for me; I didn't want to see him no more.  He used to always whale me
when he was sober and could get his hands on me; though I used to take
to the woods most of the time when he was around.  Well, about this time
he was found in the river drownded, about twelve mile above town, so
people said.  They judged it was him, anyway; said this drownded man was
just his size, and was ragged, and had uncommon long hair, which was all
like pap; but they couldn't make nothing out of the face, because it had
been in the water so long it warn't much like a face at all.  They said
he was floating on his back in the water.  They took him and buried him
on the bank.  But I warn't comfortable long, because I happened to think
of something.  I knowed mighty well that a drownded man don't float on
his back, but on his face.  So I knowed, then, that this warn't pap, but
a woman dressed up in a man's clothes.  So I was uncomfortable again.
I judged the old man would turn up again by and by, though I wished he
wouldn't.
We played robber now and then about a month, and then I resigned.  All
the boys did.  We hadn't robbed nobody, hadn't killed any people, but
only just pretended.  We used to hop out of the woods and go charging
down on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market,
but we never hived any of them.  Tom Sawyer called the hogs ingots,
and he called the turnips and stuff julery, and we would go to the
cave and powwow over what we had done, and how many people we had killed
and marked.  But I couldn't see no profit in it.  One time Tom sent a
boy to run about town with a blazing stick, which he called a slogan
(which was the sign for the Gang to get together), and then he said he
had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanish
merchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow with two
hundred elephants, and six hundred camels, and over a thousand sumter
mules, all loaded down with di'monds, and they didn't have only a guard
of four hundred soldiers, and so we would lay in ambuscade, as he called
it, and kill the lot and scoop the things.  He said we must slick up
our swords and guns, and get ready.  He never could go after even a
turnip-cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it,
though they was only lath and broomsticks, and you might scour at them
till you rotted, and then they warn't worth a mouthful of ashes more
than what they was before.  I didn't believe we could lick such a crowd
of Spaniards and A-rabs, but I wanted to see the camels and elephants,
so I was on hand next day, Saturday, in the ambuscade; and when we got
the word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill.  But there warn't
no Spaniards and A-rabs, and there warn't no camels nor no elephants.
It warn't anything but a Sunday-school picnic, and only a primer-class
at that.  We busted it up, and chased the children up the hollow; but we
never got anything but some doughnuts and jam, though Ben Rogers got
a rag doll, and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and a tract; and then the
teacher charged in, and made us drop everything and cut.
I didn't see no di'monds, and I told Tom Sawyer so.  He said there was
loads of them there, anyway; and he said there was A-rabs there, too,
and elephants and things.  I said, why couldn't we see them, then?  He
said if I warn't so ignorant, but had read a book called Don Quixote, I
would know without asking.  He said it was all done by enchantment.  He
said there was hundreds of soldiers there, and elephants and treasure,
and so on, but we had enemies which he called magicians; and they had
turned the whole thing into an infant Sunday-school, just out of spite.
I said, all right; then the thing for us to do was to go for the
magicians.  Tom Sawyer said I was a numskull.
Why, said he, a magician could call up a lot of genies, and they
would hash you up like nothing before you could say Jack Robinson.  They
are as tall as a tree and as big around as a church.
Well, I says, s'pose we got some genies to help _us_--can't we lick
the other crowd then?
How you going to get them?
I don't know.  How do _they_ get them?
Why, they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring, and then the genies
come tearing in, with the thunder and lightning a-ripping around and the
smoke a-rolling, and everything they're told to do they up and do it.
They don't think nothing of pulling a shot-tower up by the roots, and
belting a Sunday-school superintendent over the head with it--or any
other man.
Who makes them tear around so?
Why, whoever rubs the lamp or the ring.  They belong to whoever rubs
the lamp or the ring, and they've got to do whatever he says.  If he
tells them to build a palace forty miles long out of di'monds, and fill
it full of chewing-gum, or whatever you want, and fetch an emperor's
daughter from China for you to marry, they've got to do it--and they've
got to do it before sun-up next morning, too.  And more:  they've got
to waltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it, you
understand.
Well, says I, I think they are a pack of flat-heads for not keeping
the palace themselves 'stead of fooling them away like that.  And what's
more--if I was one of them I would see a man in Jericho before I would
drop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin lamp.
How you talk, Huck Finn.  Why, you'd _have_ to come when he rubbed it,
whether you wanted to or not.
What! and I as high as a tree and as big as a church?  All right, then;
I _would_ come; but I lay I'd make that man climb the highest tree there
was in the country.
Shucks, it ain't no use to talk to you, Huck Finn.  You don't seem to
know anything, somehow--perfect saphead.
I thought all this over for two or three days, and then I reckoned I
would see if there was anything in it.  I got an old tin lamp and an
iron ring, and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till I sweat
like an Injun, calculating to build a palace and sell it; but it warn't
no use, none of the genies come.  So then I judged that all that stuff
was only just one of Tom Sawyer's lies.  I reckoned he believed in the
A-rabs and the elephants, but as for me I think different.  It had all
the marks of a Sunday-school.
CHAPTER IV.
WELL, three or four months run along, and it was well into the winter
now. I had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and
write just a little, and could say the multiplication table up to six
times seven is thirty-five, and I don't reckon I could ever get any
further than that if I was to live forever.  I don't take no stock in
mathematics, anyway.
At first I hated the school, but by and by I got so I could stand it.
Whenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey, and the hiding I got next
day done me good and cheered me up.  So the longer I went to school the
easier it got to be.  I was getting sort of used to the widow's ways,
too, and they warn't so raspy on me.  Living in a house and sleeping in
a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly, but before the cold weather I
used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes, and so that was a
rest to me.  I liked the old ways best, but I was getting so I liked the
new ones, too, a little bit. The widow said I was coming along slow but
sure, and doing very satisfactory.  She said she warn't ashamed of me.
One morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at breakfast.
I reached for some of it as quick as I could to throw over my left
shoulder and keep off the bad luck, but Miss Watson was in ahead of me,
and crossed me off. She says, Take your hands away, Huckleberry; what
a mess you are always making!  The widow put in a good word for me, but
that warn't going to keep off the bad luck, I knowed that well enough.
I started out, after breakfast, feeling worried and shaky, and
wondering where it was going to fall on me, and what it was going to be.
There is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck, but this wasn't one
of them kind; so I never tried to do anything, but just poked along
low-spirited and on the watch-out.
I went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go
through the high board fence.  There was an inch of new snow on the
ground, and I seen somebody's tracks.  They had come up from the quarry
and stood around the stile a while, and then went on around the garden
fence.  It was funny they hadn't come in, after standing around so.  I
couldn't make it out.  It was very curious, somehow.  I was going to
follow around, but I stooped down to look at the tracks first.  I didn't
notice anything at first, but next I did.  There was a cross in the left
boot-heel made with big nails, to keep off the devil.
I was up in a second and shinning down the hill.  I looked over my
shoulder every now and then, but I didn't see nobody.  I was at Judge
Thatcher's as quick as I could get there.  He said:
Why, my boy, you are all out of breath.  Did you come for your
interest?
No, sir, I says; is there some for me?
Oh, yes, a half-yearly is in last night--over a hundred and fifty
dollars.  Quite a fortune for you.  You had better let me invest it
along with your six thousand, because if you take it you'll spend it.
No, sir, I says, I don't want to spend it.  I don't want it at
all--nor the six thousand, nuther.  I want you to take it; I want to give
it to you--the six thousand and all.
He looked surprised.  He couldn't seem to make it out.  He says:
Why, what can you mean, my boy?
I says, Don't you ask me no questions about it, please.  You'll take
it--won't you?
He says:
Well, I'm puzzled.  Is something the matter?
Please take it, says I, and don't ask me nothing--then I won't have to
tell no lies.
He studied a while, and then he says:
Oho-o!  I think I see.  You want to _sell_ all your property to me--not
give it.  That's the correct idea.
Then he wrote something on a paper and read it over, and says:
There; you see it says 'for a consideration.'  That means I have bought
it of you and paid you for it.  Here's a dollar for you.  Now you sign
it.
So I signed it, and left.
Miss Watson's nigger, Jim, had a hair-ball as big as your fist, which
had been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox, and he used to do
magic with it.  He said there was a spirit inside of it, and it knowed
everything.  So I went to him that night and told him pap was here
again, for I found his tracks in the snow.  What I wanted to know was,
what he was going to do, and was he going to stay?  Jim got out his
hair-ball and said something over it, and then he held it up and dropped
it on the floor.  It fell pretty solid, and only rolled about an inch.
Jim tried it again, and then another time, and it acted just the same.
Jim got down on his knees, and put his ear against it and listened.
But it warn't no use; he said it wouldn't talk. He said sometimes it
wouldn't talk without money.  I told him I had an old slick counterfeit
quarter that warn't no good because the brass showed through the silver
a little, and it wouldn't pass nohow, even if the brass didn't show,
because it was so slick it felt greasy, and so that would tell on it
every time.  (I reckoned I wouldn't say nothing about the dollar I got
from the judge.) I said it was pretty bad money, but maybe the hair-ball
would take it, because maybe it wouldn't know the difference.  Jim smelt
it and bit it and rubbed it, and said he would manage so the hair-ball
would think it was good.  He said he would split open a raw Irish potato
and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night, and next
morning you couldn't see no brass, and it wouldn't feel greasy no more,
and so anybody in town would take it in a minute, let alone a hair-ball.
Well, I knowed a potato would do that before, but I had forgot it.
Jim put the quarter under the hair-ball, and got down and listened
again. This time he said the hair-ball was all right.  He said it
would tell my whole fortune if I wanted it to.  I says, go on.  So the
hair-ball talked to Jim, and Jim told it to me.  He says:
Yo' ole father doan' know yit what he's a-gwyne to do.  Sometimes he
spec he'll go 'way, en den agin he spec he'll stay.  De bes' way is to
res' easy en let de ole man take his own way.  Dey's two angels hoverin'
roun' 'bout him.  One uv 'em is white en shiny, en t'other one is black.
De white one gits him to go right a little while, den de black one sail
in en bust it all up.  A body can't tell yit which one gwyne to fetch
him at de las'.  But you is all right.  You gwyne to have considable
trouble in yo' life, en considable joy.  Sometimes you gwyne to git
hurt, en sometimes you gwyne to git sick; but every time you's gwyne
to git well agin.  Dey's two gals flyin' 'bout you in yo' life.  One
uv 'em's light en t'other one is dark. One is rich en t'other is po'.
You's gwyne to marry de po' one fust en de rich one by en by.  You
wants to keep 'way fum de water as much as you kin, en don't run no
resk, 'kase it's down in de bills dat you's gwyne to git hung.
When I lit my candle and went up to my room that night there sat pap his
own self!
CHAPTER V.
I had shut the door to.  Then I turned around and there he was.  I used
to be scared of him all the time, he tanned me so much.  I reckoned I
was scared now, too; but in a minute I see I was mistaken--that is, after
the first jolt, as you may say, when my breath sort of hitched, he being
so unexpected; but right away after I see I warn't scared of him worth
bothring about.
He was most fifty, and he looked it.  His hair was long and tangled and
greasy, and hung down, and you could see his eyes shining through
like he was behind vines.  It was all black, no gray; so was his long,
mixed-up whiskers.  There warn't no color in his face, where his face
showed; it was white; not like another man's white, but a white to make
a body sick, a white to make a body's flesh crawl--a tree-toad white, a
fish-belly white.  As for his clothes--just rags, that was all.  He had
one ankle resting on t'other knee; the boot on that foot was busted, and
two of his toes stuck through, and he worked them now and then.  His hat
was laying on the floor--an old black slouch with the top caved in, like
a lid.
I stood a-looking at him; he set there a-looking at me, with his chair
tilted back a little.  I set the candle down.  I noticed the window was
up; so he had clumb in by the shed.  He kept a-looking me all over.  By
and by he says:
Starchy clothes--very.  You think you're a good deal of a big-bug,
_don't_ you?
Maybe I am, maybe I ain't, I says.
Don't you give me none o' your lip, says he.  You've put on
considerable many frills since I been away.  I'll take you down a peg
before I get done with you.  You're educated, too, they say--can read and
write.  You think you're better'n your father, now, don't you, because
he can't?  _I'll_ take it out of you.  Who told you you might meddle
with such hifalut'n foolishness, hey?--who told you you could?
The widow.  She told me.
The widow, hey?--and who told the widow she could put in her shovel
about a thing that ain't none of her business?
Nobody never told her.
Well, I'll learn her how to meddle.  And looky here--you drop that
school, you hear?  I'll learn people to bring up a boy to put on airs
over his own father and let on to be better'n what _he_ is.  You lemme
catch you fooling around that school again, you hear?  Your mother
couldn't read, and she couldn't write, nuther, before she died.  None
of the family couldn't before _they_ died.  I can't; and here you're
a-swelling yourself up like this.  I ain't the man to stand it--you hear?
Say, lemme hear you read.
I took up a book and begun something about General Washington and the
wars. When I'd read about a half a minute, he fetched the book a whack
with his hand and knocked it across the house.  He says:
It's so.  You can do it.  I had my doubts when you told me.  Now looky
here; you stop that putting on frills.  I won't have it.  I'll lay for
you, my smarty; and if I catch you about that school I'll tan you good.
First you know you'll get religion, too.  I never see such a son.
He took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy, and
says:
What's this?
It's something they give me for learning my lessons good.
He tore it up, and says:
I'll give you something better--I'll give you a cowhide.
He set there a-mumbling and a-growling a minute, and then he says:
_Ain't_ you a sweet-scented dandy, though?  A bed; and bedclothes; and
a look'n'-glass; and a piece of carpet on the floor--and your own father
got to sleep with the hogs in the tanyard.  I never see such a son.  I
bet I'll take some o' these frills out o' you before I'm done with you.
Why, there ain't no end to your airs--they say you're rich.  Hey?--how's
that?
They lie--that's how.
Looky here--mind how you talk to me; I'm a-standing about all I can
stand now--so don't gimme no sass.  I've been in town two days, and I
hain't heard nothing but about you bein' rich.  I heard about it
away down the river, too.  That's why I come.  You git me that money
to-morrow--I want it.
I hain't got no money.
It's a lie.  Judge Thatcher's got it.  You git it.  I want it.
I hain't got no money, I tell you.  You ask Judge Thatcher; he'll tell
you the same.
All right.  I'll ask him; and I'll make him pungle, too, or I'll know
the reason why.  Say, how much you got in your pocket?  I want it.
I hain't got only a dollar, and I want that to--
It don't make no difference what you want it for--you just shell it
out.
He took it and bit it to see if it was good, and then he said he was
going down town to get some whisky; said he hadn't had a drink all day.
When he had got out on the shed he put his head in again, and cussed
me for putting on frills and trying to be better than him; and when I
reckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again, and told me
to mind about that school, because he was going to lay for me and lick
me if I didn't drop that.
Next day he was drunk, and he went to Judge Thatcher's and bullyragged
him, and tried to make him give up the money; but he couldn't, and then
he swore he'd make the law force him.
The judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away
from him and let one of them be my guardian; but it was a new judge that
had just come, and he didn't know the old man; so he said courts mustn't
interfere and separate families if they could help it; said he'd druther
not take a child away from its father.  So Judge Thatcher and the widow
had to quit on the business.
That pleased the old man till he couldn't rest.  He said he'd cowhide
me till I was black and blue if I didn't raise some money for him.  I
borrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher, and pap took it and got
drunk, and went a-blowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying
on; and he kept it up all over town, with a tin pan, till most midnight;
then they jailed him, and next day they had him before court, and jailed
him again for a week.  But he said _he_ was satisfied; said he was boss
of his son, and he'd make it warm for _him_.
When he got out the new judge said he was a-going to make a man of him.
So he took him to his own house, and dressed him up clean and nice, and
had him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family, and was just
old pie to him, so to speak.  And after supper he talked to him about
temperance and such things till the old man cried, and said he'd been
a fool, and fooled away his life; but now he was a-going to turn over
a new leaf and be a man nobody wouldn't be ashamed of, and he hoped the
judge would help him and not look down on him.  The judge said he could
hug him for them words; so he cried, and his wife she cried again; pap
said he'd been a man that had always been misunderstood before, and the
judge said he believed it.  The old man said that what a man wanted
that was down was sympathy, and the judge said it was so; so they cried
again.  And when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his
hand, and says:
Look at it, gentlemen and ladies all; take a-hold of it; shake it.
There's a hand that was the hand of a hog; but it ain't so no more; it's
the hand of a man that's started in on a new life, and'll die before
he'll go back.  You mark them words--don't forget I said them.  It's a
clean hand now; shake it--don't be afeard.
So they shook it, one after the other, all around, and cried.  The
judge's wife she kissed it.  Then the old man he signed a pledge--made
his mark. The judge said it was the holiest time on record, or something
like that. Then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room, which was
the spare room, and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty and
clumb out on to the porch-roof and slid down a stanchion and traded his
new coat for a jug of forty-rod, and clumb back again and had a good old
time; and towards daylight he crawled out again, drunk as a fiddler, and
rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places, and was most
froze to death when somebody found him after sun-up.  And when they come
to look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they could
navigate it.
The judge he felt kind of sore.  He said he reckoned a body could reform
the old man with a shotgun, maybe, but he didn't know no other way.
CHAPTER VI.
WELL, pretty soon the old man was up and around again, and then he went
for Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money, and he
went for me, too, for not stopping school.  He catched me a couple of
times and thrashed me, but I went to school just the same, and dodged
him or outrun him most of the time.  I didn't want to go to school much
before, but I reckoned I'd go now to spite pap.  That law trial was a
slow business--appeared like they warn't ever going to get started on it;
so every now and then I'd borrow two or three dollars off of the judge
for him, to keep from getting a cowhiding.  Every time he got money he
got drunk; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around town; and
every time he raised Cain he got jailed.  He was just suited--this kind
of thing was right in his line.
He got to hanging around the widow's too much and so she told him at
last that if he didn't quit using around there she would make trouble
for him. Well, _wasn't_ he mad?  He said he would show who was Huck
Finn's boss.  So he watched out for me one day in the spring, and
catched me, and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff, and
crossed over to the Illinois shore where it was woody and there warn't
no houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thick
you couldn't find it if you didn't know where it was.
He kept me with him all the time, and I never got a chance to run off.
We lived in that old cabin, and he always locked the door and put the
key under his head nights.  He had a gun which he had stole, I reckon,
and we fished and hunted, and that was what we lived on.  Every little
while he locked me in and went down to the store, three miles, to the
ferry, and traded fish and game for whisky, and fetched it home and got
drunk and had a good time, and licked me.  The widow she found out where
I was by and by, and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me; but
pap drove him off with the gun, and it warn't long after that till I was
used to being where I was, and liked it--all but the cowhide part.
It was kind of lazy and jolly, laying off comfortable all day, smoking
and fishing, and no books nor study.  Two months or more run along, and
my clothes got to be all rags and dirt, and I didn't see how I'd ever
got to like it so well at the widow's, where you had to wash, and eat on
a plate, and comb up, and go to bed and get up regular, and be forever
bothering over a book, and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all the
time.  I didn't want to go back no more.  I had stopped cussing, because
the widow didn't like it; but now I took to it again because pap hadn't
no objections.  It was pretty good times up in the woods there, take it
all around.
But by and by pap got too handy with his hick'ry, and I couldn't stand
it. I was all over welts.  He got to going away so much, too, and
locking me in.  Once he locked me in and was gone three days.  It was
dreadful lonesome.  I judged he had got drownded, and I wasn't ever
going to get out any more.  I was scared.  I made up my mind I would fix
up some way to leave there.  I had tried to get out of that cabin many
a time, but I couldn't find no way.  There warn't a window to it big
enough for a dog to get through.  I couldn't get up the chimbly; it
was too narrow.  The door was thick, solid oak slabs.  Pap was pretty
careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away;
I reckon I had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times; well, I
was most all the time at it, because it was about the only way to put in
the time.  But this time I found something at last; I found an old rusty
wood-saw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and the
clapboards of the roof. I greased it up and went to work.  There was an
old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin
behind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and
putting the candle out.  I got under the table and raised the blanket,
and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out--big enough
to let me through.  Well, it was a good long job, but I was getting
towards the end of it when I heard pap's gun in the woods.  I got rid of
the signs of my work, and dropped the blanket and hid my saw, and pretty
soon pap come in.
Pap warn't in a good humor--so he was his natural self.  He said he was
down town, and everything was going wrong.  His lawyer said he reckoned
he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on
the trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long time, and Judge
Thatcher knowed how to do it. And he said people allowed there'd be
another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my
guardian, and they guessed it would win this time.  This shook me up
considerable, because I didn't want to go back to the widow's any more
and be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called it.  Then the old man
got to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he could think of,
and then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn't skipped any,
and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round,
including a considerable parcel of people which he didn't know the names
of, and so called them what's-his-name when he got to them, and went
right along with his cussing.
He said he would like to see the widow get me.  He said he would watch
out, and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place
six or seven mile off to stow me in, where they might hunt till they
dropped and they couldn't find me.  That made me pretty uneasy again,
but only for a minute; I reckoned I wouldn't stay on hand till he got
that chance.
The old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had
got. There was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, and a side of bacon,
ammunition, and a four-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two
newspapers for wadding, besides some tow.  I toted up a load, and went
back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest.  I thought it all
over, and I reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines, and
take to the woods when I run away.  I guessed I wouldn't stay in one
place, but just tramp right across the country, mostly night times, and
hunt and fish to keep alive, and so get so far away that the old man nor
the widow couldn't ever find me any more.  I judged I would saw out and
leave that night if pap got drunk enough, and I reckoned he would.  I
got so full of it I didn't notice how long I was staying till the old
man hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drownded.
I got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about dark.  While
I was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of
warmed up, and went to ripping again.  He had been drunk over in town,
and laid in the gutter all night, and he was a sight to look at.  A body
would a thought he was Adam--he was just all mud.  Whenever his liquor
begun to work he most always went for the govment, this time he says:
Call this a govment! why, just look at it and see what it's like.
Here's the law a-standing ready to take a man's son away from him--a
man's own son, which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety
and all the expense of raising.  Yes, just as that man has got that
son raised at last, and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin' for
_him_ and give him a rest, the law up and goes for him.  And they call
_that_ govment!  That ain't all, nuther.  The law backs that old Judge
Thatcher up and helps him to keep me out o' my property.  Here's what
the law does:  The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and
up'ards, and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this, and lets
him go round in clothes that ain't fitten for a hog. They call that
govment!  A man can't get his rights in a govment like this. Sometimes
I've a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all. Yes,
and I _told_ 'em so; I told old Thatcher so to his face.  Lots of 'em
heard me, and can tell what I said.  Says I, for two cents I'd leave the
blamed country and never come a-near it agin.  Them's the very words.  I
says look at my hat--if you call it a hat--but the lid raises up and the
rest of it goes down till it's below my chin, and then it ain't rightly
a hat at all, but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o'
stove-pipe.  Look at it, says I--such a hat for me to wear--one of the
wealthiest men in this town if I could git my rights.
Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful.  Why, looky here.
There was a free nigger there from Ohio--a mulatter, most as white as
a white man.  He had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too, and the
shiniest hat; and there ain't a man in that town that's got as fine
clothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and a
silver-headed cane--the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State.  And
what do you think?  They said he was a p'fessor in a college, and could
talk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything.  And that ain't the
wust. They said he could _vote_ when he was at home.  Well, that let me
out. Thinks I, what is the country a-coming to?  It was 'lection day,
and I was just about to go and vote myself if I warn't too drunk to get
there; but when they told me there was a State in this country where
they'd let that nigger vote, I drawed out.  I says I'll never vote agin.
Them's the very words I said; they all heard me; and the country may
rot for all me--I'll never vote agin as long as I live.  And to see the
cool way of that nigger--why, he wouldn't a give me the road if I hadn't
shoved him out o' the way.  I says to the people, why ain't this nigger
put up at auction and sold?--that's what I want to know.  And what do you
reckon they said? Why, they said he couldn't be sold till he'd been in
the State six months, and he hadn't been there that long yet.  There,
now--that's a specimen.  They call that a govment that can't sell a free
nigger till he's been in the State six months.  Here's a govment that
calls itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment, and thinks it is a
govment, and yet's got to set stock-still for six whole months before
it can take a hold of a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted free
nigger, and--
Pap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was
taking him to, so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and
barked both shins, and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind
of language--mostly hove at the nigger and the govment, though he give
the tub some, too, all along, here and there.  He hopped around the
cabin considerable, first on one leg and then on the other, holding
first one shin and then the other one, and at last he let out with his
left foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick.  But it
warn't good judgment, because that was the boot that had a couple of his
toes leaking out of the front end of it; so now he raised a howl that
fairly made a body's hair raise, and down he went in the dirt, and
rolled there, and held his toes; and the cussing he done then laid over
anything he had ever done previous.  He said so his own self afterwards.
He had heard old Sowberry Hagan in his best days, and he said it laid
over him, too; but I reckon that was sort of piling it on, maybe.
After supper pap took the jug, and said he had enough whisky there
for two drunks and one delirium tremens.  That was always his word.  I
judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour, and then I would steal
the key, or saw myself out, one or t'other.  He drank and drank, and
tumbled down on his blankets by and by; but luck didn't run my way.
He didn't go sound asleep, but was uneasy.  He groaned and moaned and
thrashed around this way and that for a long time.  At last I got so
sleepy I couldn't keep my eyes open all I could do, and so before I
knowed what I was about I was sound asleep, and the candle burning.
I don't know how long I was asleep, but all of a sudden there was an
awful scream and I was up.  There was pap looking wild, and skipping
around every which way and yelling about snakes.  He said they was
crawling up his legs; and then he would give a jump and scream, and say
one had bit him on the cheek--but I couldn't see no snakes.  He started
and run round and round the cabin, hollering Take him off! take him
off! he's biting me on the neck!  I never see a man look so wild in the
eyes. Pretty soon he was all fagged out, and fell down panting; then he
rolled over and over wonderful fast, kicking things every which way,
and striking and grabbing at the air with his hands, and screaming and
saying there was devils a-hold of him.  He wore out by and by, and laid
still a while, moaning.  Then he laid stiller, and didn't make a sound.
I could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods, and it
seemed terrible still.  He was laying over by the corner. By and by he
raised up part way and listened, with his head to one side.  He says,
very low:
Tramp--tramp--tramp; that's the dead; tramp--tramp--tramp; they're coming
after me; but I won't go.  Oh, they're here! don't touch me--don't! hands
off--they're cold; let go.  Oh, let a poor devil alone!
Then he went down on all fours and crawled off, begging them to let him
alone, and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the
old pine table, still a-begging; and then he went to crying.  I could
hear him through the blanket.
By and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild, and he
see me and went for me.  He chased me round and round the place with a
clasp-knife, calling me the Angel of Death, and saying he would kill me,
and then I couldn't come for him no more.  I begged, and told him I
was only Huck; but he laughed _such_ a screechy laugh, and roared and
cussed, and kept on chasing me up.  Once when I turned short and
dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my
shoulders, and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of the jacket quick
as lightning, and saved myself. Pretty soon he was all tired out, and
dropped down with his back against the door, and said he would rest a
minute and then kill me. He put his knife under him, and said he would
sleep and get strong, and then he would see who was who.
So he dozed off pretty soon.  By and by I got the old split-bottom chair
and clumb up as easy as I could, not to make any noise, and got down the
gun.  I slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded, then I
laid it across the turnip barrel, pointing towards pap, and set down
behind it to wait for him to stir.  And how slow and still the time did
drag along.
CHAPTER VII.
GIT up!  What you 'bout?
I opened my eyes and looked around, trying to make out where I was.  It
was after sun-up, and I had been sound asleep.  Pap was standing over me
looking sour and sick, too.  He says:
What you doin' with this gun?
I judged he didn't know nothing about what he had been doing, so I says:
Somebody tried to get in, so I was laying for him.
Why didn't you roust me out?
Well, I tried to, but I couldn't; I couldn't budge you.
Well, all right.  Don't stand there palavering all day, but out with
you and see if there's a fish on the lines for breakfast.  I'll be along
in a minute.
He unlocked the door, and I cleared out up the river-bank.  I noticed
some pieces of limbs and such things floating down, and a sprinkling of
bark; so I knowed the river had begun to rise.  I reckoned I would have
great times now if I was over at the town.  The June rise used to be
always luck for me; because as soon as that rise begins here comes
cordwood floating down, and pieces of log rafts--sometimes a dozen logs
together; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the
wood-yards and the sawmill.
I went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t'other one out
for what the rise might fetch along.  Well, all at once here comes a
canoe; just a beauty, too, about thirteen or fourteen foot long, riding
high like a duck.  I shot head-first off of the bank like a frog,
clothes and all on, and struck out for the canoe.  I just expected
there'd be somebody laying down in it, because people often done that
to fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they'd
raise up and laugh at him.  But it warn't so this time.  It was a
drift-canoe sure enough, and I clumb in and paddled her ashore.  Thinks
I, the old man will be glad when he sees this--she's worth ten dollars.
But when I got to shore pap wasn't in sight yet, and as I was running
her into a little creek like a gully, all hung over with vines and
willows, I struck another idea:  I judged I'd hide her good, and then,
'stead of taking to the woods when I run off, I'd go down the river
about fifty mile and camp in one place for good, and not have such a
rough time tramping on foot.
It was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought I heard the old man
coming all the time; but I got her hid; and then I out and looked around
a bunch of willows, and there was the old man down the path a piece just
drawing a bead on a bird with his gun.  So he hadn't seen anything.
When he got along I was hard at it taking up a trot line.  He abused
me a little for being so slow; but I told him I fell in the river, and
that was what made me so long.  I knowed he would see I was wet, and
then he would be asking questions.  We got five catfish off the lines
and went home.
While we laid off after breakfast to sleep up, both of us being about
wore out, I got to thinking that if I could fix up some way to keep pap
and the widow from trying to follow me, it would be a certainer thing
than trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me; you
see, all kinds of things might happen.  Well, I didn't see no way for a
while, but by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel of
water, and he says:
Another time a man comes a-prowling round here you roust me out, you
hear? That man warn't here for no good.  I'd a shot him.  Next time you
roust me out, you hear?
Then he dropped down and went to sleep again; but what he had been
saying give me the very idea I wanted.  I says to myself, I can fix it
now so nobody won't think of following me.
About twelve o'clock we turned out and went along up the bank.  The
river was coming up pretty fast, and lots of driftwood going by on the
rise. By and by along comes part of a log raft--nine logs fast together.
We went out with the skiff and towed it ashore.  Then we had dinner.
Anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through, so as to catch
more stuff; but that warn't pap's style.  Nine logs was enough for one
time; he must shove right over to town and sell.  So he locked me in and
took the skiff, and started off towing the raft about half-past three.
I judged he wouldn't come back that night.  I waited till I reckoned he
had got a good start; then I out with my saw, and went to work on that
log again.  Before he was t'other side of the river I was out of the
hole; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder.
I took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid, and
shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the same
with the side of bacon; then the whisky-jug.  I took all the coffee and
sugar there was, and all the ammunition; I took the wadding; I took the
bucket and gourd; I took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and two
blankets, and the skillet and the coffee-pot.  I took fish-lines and
matches and other things--everything that was worth a cent.  I cleaned
out the place.  I wanted an axe, but there wasn't any, only the one out
at the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to leave that.  I fetched
out the gun, and now I was done.
I had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging
out so many things.  So I fixed that as good as I could from the outside
by scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness and the
sawdust.  Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place, and put two
rocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was bent up
at that place and didn't quite touch ground.  If you stood four or five
foot away and didn't know it was sawed, you wouldn't never notice
it; and besides, this was the back of the cabin, and it warn't likely
anybody would go fooling around there.
It was all grass clear to the canoe, so I hadn't left a track.  I
followed around to see.  I stood on the bank and looked out over the
river.  All safe.  So I took the gun and went up a piece into the woods,
and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig; hogs soon
went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie
farms. I shot this fellow and took him into camp.
I took the axe and smashed in the door.  I beat it and hacked it
considerable a-doing it.  I fetched the pig in, and took him back nearly
to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe, and laid him down
on the ground to bleed; I say ground because it was ground--hard packed,
and no boards.  Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks
in it--all I could drag--and I started it from the pig, and dragged it to
the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in, and
down it sunk, out of sight.  You could easy see that something had been
dragged over the ground.  I did wish Tom Sawyer was there; I knowed he
would take an interest in this kind of business, and throw in the fancy
touches.  Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as
that.
Well, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and
stuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner.  Then I
took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn't
drip) till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into
the river.  Now I thought of something else.  So I went and got the bag
of meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the house.
I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the
bottom of it with the saw, for there warn't no knives and forks on the
place--pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking.  Then
I carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through
the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile wide
and full of rushes--and ducks too, you might say, in the season.  There
was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went
miles away, I don't know where, but it didn't go to the river.  The meal
sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake.  I dropped
pap's whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been done by
accident. Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string, so it
wouldn't leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again.
It was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some
willows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise.  I
made fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by and by laid
down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan.  I says to myself,
they'll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then
drag the river for me.  And they'll follow that meal track to the lake
and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers
that killed me and took the things.  They won't ever hunt the river for
anything but my dead carcass. They'll soon get tired of that, and won't
bother no more about me.  All right; I can stop anywhere I want to.
Jackson's Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well,
and nobody ever comes there.  And then I can paddle over to town nights,
and slink around and pick up things I want. Jackson's Island's the
place.
I was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep.  When
I woke up I didn't know where I was for a minute.  I set up and looked
around, a little scared.  Then I remembered.  The river looked miles and
miles across.  The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs
that went a-slipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out from
shore. Everything was dead quiet, and it looked late, and _smelt_ late.
You know what I mean--I don't know the words to put it in.
I took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and start
when I heard a sound away over the water.  I listened.  Pretty soon I
made it out.  It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from
oars working in rowlocks when it's a still night.  I peeped out through
the willow branches, and there it was--a skiff, away across the water.
I couldn't tell how many was in it.  It kept a-coming, and when it was
abreast of me I see there warn't but one man in it.  Think's I, maybe
it's pap, though I warn't expecting him.  He dropped below me with the
current, and by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water,
and he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him.
Well, it _was_ pap, sure enough--and sober, too, by the way he laid his
oars.
I didn't lose no time.  The next minute I was a-spinning down stream
soft but quick in the shade of the bank.  I made two mile and a half,
and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of
the river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing, and
people might see me and hail me.  I got out amongst the driftwood, and
then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float.
I laid there, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, looking
away into the sky; not a cloud in it.  The sky looks ever so deep when
you lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it before.
And how far a body can hear on the water such nights!  I heard people
talking at the ferry landing. I heard what they said, too--every word
of it.  One man said it was getting towards the long days and the short
nights now.  T'other one said _this_ warn't one of the short ones, he
reckoned--and then they laughed, and he said it over again, and they
laughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him, and
laughed, but he didn't laugh; he ripped out something brisk, and said
let him alone.  The first fellow said he 'lowed to tell it to his
old woman--she would think it was pretty good; but he said that warn't
nothing to some things he had said in his time. I heard one man say it
was nearly three o'clock, and he hoped daylight wouldn't wait more than
about a week longer.  After that the talk got further and further away,
and I couldn't make out the words any more; but I could hear the mumble,
and now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways off.
I was away below the ferry now.  I rose up, and there was Jackson's
Island, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy timbered and
standing up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like
a steamboat without any lights.  There warn't any signs of the bar at
the head--it was all under water now.
It didn't take me long to get there.  I shot past the head at a ripping
rate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water and
landed on the side towards the Illinois shore.  I run the canoe into
a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow
branches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe
from the outside.
I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked
out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town,
three mile away, where there was three or four lights twinkling.  A
monstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up stream, coming along down,
with a lantern in the middle of it.  I watched it come creeping down,
and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say, Stern
oars, there! heave her head to stabboard!  I heard that just as plain
as if the man was by my side.
There was a little gray in the sky now; so I stepped into the woods, and
laid down for a nap before breakfast.
CHAPTER VIII.
THE sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight
o'clock.  I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about
things, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied.  I
could see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees
all about, and gloomy in there amongst them.  There was freckled places
on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the
freckled places swapped about a little, showing there was a little
breeze up there.  A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me
very friendly.
I was powerful lazy and comfortable--didn't want to get up and cook
breakfast.  Well, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep
sound of boom! away up the river.  I rouses up, and rests on my elbow
and listens; pretty soon I hears it again.  I hopped up, and went and
looked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke laying
on the water a long ways up--about abreast the ferry.  And there was the
ferryboat full of people floating along down.  I knowed what was the
matter now.  Boom! I see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat's
side.  You see, they was firing cannon over the water, trying to make my
carcass come to the top.
I was pretty hungry, but it warn't going to do for me to start a fire,
because they might see the smoke.  So I set there and watched the
cannon-smoke and listened to the boom.  The river was a mile wide there,
and it always looks pretty on a summer morning--so I was having a good
enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to
eat. Well, then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver in
loaves of bread and float them off, because they always go right to the
drownded carcass and stop there.  So, says I, I'll keep a lookout, and
if any of them's floating around after me I'll give them a show.  I
changed to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could
have, and I warn't disappointed.  A big double loaf come along, and I
most got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she floated out
further.  Of course I was where the current set in the closest to the
shore--I knowed enough for that.  But by and by along comes another one,
and this time I won.  I took out the plug and shook out the little dab
of quicksilver, and set my teeth in.  It was baker's bread--what the
quality eat; none of your low-down corn-pone.
I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching
the bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied.  And
then something struck me.  I says, now I reckon the widow or the parson
or somebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has gone
and done it.  So there ain't no doubt but there is something in that
thing--that is, there's something in it when a body like the widow or the
parson prays, but it don't work for me, and I reckon it don't work for
only just the right kind.
I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching.  The
ferryboat was floating with the current, and I allowed I'd have a chance
to see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come in
close, where the bread did.  When she'd got pretty well along down
towards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread,
and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place.  Where
the log forked I could peep through.
By and by she come along, and she drifted in so close that they could
a run out a plank and walked ashore.  Most everybody was on the boat.
Pap, and Judge Thatcher, and Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and Tom
Sawyer, and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more.
Everybody was talking about the murder, but the captain broke in and
says:
Look sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he's
washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water's edge.  I
hope so, anyway.
I didn't hope so.  They all crowded up and leaned over the rails, nearly
in my face, and kept still, watching with all their might.  I could see
them first-rate, but they couldn't see me.  Then the captain sung out:
Stand away! and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that
it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke, and
I judged I was gone.  If they'd a had some bullets in, I reckon they'd
a got the corpse they was after.  Well, I see I warn't hurt, thanks to
goodness. The boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder
of the island.  I could hear the booming now and then, further and
further off, and by and by, after an hour, I didn't hear it no more.
The island was three mile long.  I judged they had got to the foot, and
was giving it up.  But they didn't yet a while.  They turned around
the foot of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side,
under steam, and booming once in a while as they went.  I crossed over
to that side and watched them. When they got abreast the head of the
island they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and
went home to the town.
I knowed I was all right now.  Nobody else would come a-hunting after
me. I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick
woods.  I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things
under so the rain couldn't get at them.  I catched a catfish and haggled
him open with my saw, and towards sundown I started my camp fire and had
supper.  Then I set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast.
When it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking, and feeling pretty well
satisfied; but by and by it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and set
on the bank and listened to the current swashing along, and counted the
stars and drift logs and rafts that come down, and then went to bed;
there ain't no better way to put in time when you are lonesome; you
can't stay so, you soon get over it.
And so for three days and nights.  No difference--just the same thing.
But the next day I went exploring around down through the island.  I was
boss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to know
all about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time.  I found plenty
strawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and green
razberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show.  They
would all come handy by and by, I judged.
Well, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn't
far from the foot of the island.  I had my gun along, but I hadn't shot
nothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game nigh
home. About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake,
and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after
it, trying to get a shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I
bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking.
My heart jumped up amongst my lungs.  I never waited for to look
further, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as
fast as ever I could.  Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the
thick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn't hear
nothing else.  I slunk along another piece further, then listened again;
and so on, and so on.  If I see a stump, I took it for a man; if I trod
on a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a person had cut one of my
breaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too.
When I got to camp I warn't feeling very brash, there warn't much sand
in my craw; but I says, this ain't no time to be fooling around.  So I
got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight,
and I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an
old last year's camp, and then clumb a tree.
I reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn't see nothing,
I didn't hear nothing--I only _thought_ I heard and seen as much as a
thousand things.  Well, I couldn't stay up there forever; so at last I
got down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the
time. All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from
breakfast.
By the time it was night I was pretty hungry.  So when it was good
and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the
Illinois bank--about a quarter of a mile.  I went out in the woods and
cooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay there
all night when I hear a _plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk_, and says
to myself, horses coming; and next I hear people's voices.  I got
everything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping
through the woods to see what I could find out.  I hadn't got far when I
hear a man say:
We better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is about
beat out.  Let's look around.
I didn't wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy.  I tied up in the
old place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe.
I didn't sleep much.  I couldn't, somehow, for thinking.  And every time
I waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck.  So the sleep didn't
do me no good.  By and by I says to myself, I can't live this way; I'm
a-going to find out who it is that's here on the island with me; I'll
find it out or bust.  Well, I felt better right off.
So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and
then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows.  The moon was
shining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day.
I poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and sound
asleep. Well, by this time I was most down to the foot of the island.  A
little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as saying
the night was about done.  I give her a turn with the paddle and brung
her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge
of the woods.  I sat down there on a log, and looked out through the
leaves.  I see the moon go off watch, and the darkness begin to blanket
the river. But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops,
and knowed the day was coming.  So I took my gun and slipped off towards
where I had run across that camp fire, stopping every minute or two
to listen.  But I hadn't no luck somehow; I couldn't seem to find the
place.  But by and by, sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire away
through the trees.  I went for it, cautious and slow.  By and by I was
close enough to have a look, and there laid a man on the ground.  It
most give me the fan-tods. He had a blanket around his head, and his
head was nearly in the fire.  I set there behind a clump of bushes, in
about six foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady.  It was getting
gray daylight now.  Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove
off the blanket, and it was Miss Watson's Jim!  I bet I was glad to see
him.  I says:
Hello, Jim! and skipped out.
He bounced up and stared at me wild.  Then he drops down on his knees,
and puts his hands together and says:
Doan' hurt me--don't!  I hain't ever done no harm to a ghos'.  I alwuz
liked dead people, en done all I could for 'em.  You go en git in de
river agin, whah you b'longs, en doan' do nuffn to Ole Jim, 'at 'uz
awluz yo' fren'.
Well, I warn't long making him understand I warn't dead.  I was ever so
glad to see Jim.  I warn't lonesome now.  I told him I warn't afraid of
_him_ telling the people where I was.  I talked along, but he only set
there and looked at me; never said nothing.  Then I says:
It's good daylight.  Le's get breakfast.  Make up your camp fire good.
What's de use er makin' up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich
truck? But you got a gun, hain't you?  Den we kin git sumfn better den
strawbries.
Strawberries and such truck, I says.  Is that what you live on?
I couldn' git nuffn else, he says.
Why, how long you been on the island, Jim?
I come heah de night arter you's killed.
What, all that time?
Yes--indeedy.
And ain't you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?
No, sah--nuffn else.
Well, you must be most starved, ain't you?
I reck'n I could eat a hoss.  I think I could. How long you ben on de
islan'?
Since the night I got killed.
No!  W'y, what has you lived on?  But you got a gun.  Oh, yes, you got
a gun.  Dat's good.  Now you kill sumfn en I'll make up de fire.
So we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in
a grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and
coffee, and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the
nigger was set back considerable, because he reckoned it was all done
with witchcraft. I catched a good big catfish, too, and Jim cleaned him
with his knife, and fried him.
When breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot.
Jim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved.  Then
when we had got pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied.  By and by
Jim says:
But looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat 'uz killed in dat shanty ef it
warn't you?
Then I told him the whole thing, and he said it was smart.  He said Tom
Sawyer couldn't get up no better plan than what I had.  Then I says:
How do you come to be here, Jim, and how'd you get here?
He looked pretty uneasy, and didn't say nothing for a minute.  Then he
says:
Maybe I better not tell.
Why, Jim?
Well, dey's reasons.  But you wouldn' tell on me ef I uz to tell you,
would you, Huck?
Blamed if I would, Jim.
Well, I b'lieve you, Huck.  I--_I run off_.
Jim!
But mind, you said you wouldn' tell--you know you said you wouldn' tell,
Huck.
Well, I did.  I said I wouldn't, and I'll stick to it.  Honest _injun_,
I will.  People would call me a low-down Abolitionist and despise me for
keeping mum--but that don't make no difference.  I ain't a-going to tell,
and I ain't a-going back there, anyways.  So, now, le's know all about
it.
Well, you see, it 'uz dis way.  Ole missus--dat's Miss Watson--she pecks
on me all de time, en treats me pooty rough, but she awluz said she
wouldn' sell me down to Orleans.  But I noticed dey wuz a nigger trader
roun' de place considable lately, en I begin to git oneasy.  Well, one
night I creeps to de do' pooty late, en de do' warn't quite shet, en I
hear old missus tell de widder she gwyne to sell me down to Orleans, but
she didn' want to, but she could git eight hund'd dollars for me, en it
'uz sich a big stack o' money she couldn' resis'.  De widder she try to
git her to say she wouldn' do it, but I never waited to hear de res'.  I
lit out mighty quick, I tell you.
I tuck out en shin down de hill, en 'spec to steal a skift 'long de
sho' som'ers 'bove de town, but dey wuz people a-stirring yit, so I hid
in de ole tumble-down cooper-shop on de bank to wait for everybody to
go 'way. Well, I wuz dah all night.  Dey wuz somebody roun' all de time.
'Long 'bout six in de mawnin' skifts begin to go by, en 'bout eight er
nine every skift dat went 'long wuz talkin' 'bout how yo' pap come over
to de town en say you's killed.  Dese las' skifts wuz full o' ladies en
genlmen a-goin' over for to see de place.  Sometimes dey'd pull up at
de sho' en take a res' b'fo' dey started acrost, so by de talk I got to
know all 'bout de killin'.  I 'uz powerful sorry you's killed, Huck, but
I ain't no mo' now.
I laid dah under de shavin's all day.  I 'uz hungry, but I warn't
afeard; bekase I knowed ole missus en de widder wuz goin' to start to
de camp-meet'n' right arter breakfas' en be gone all day, en dey knows
I goes off wid de cattle 'bout daylight, so dey wouldn' 'spec to see me
roun' de place, en so dey wouldn' miss me tell arter dark in de evenin'.
De yuther servants wouldn' miss me, kase dey'd shin out en take holiday
soon as de ole folks 'uz out'n de way.
Well, when it come dark I tuck out up de river road, en went 'bout two
mile er more to whah dey warn't no houses.  I'd made up my mine 'bout
what I's agwyne to do.  You see, ef I kep' on tryin' to git away afoot,
de dogs 'ud track me; ef I stole a skift to cross over, dey'd miss dat
skift, you see, en dey'd know 'bout whah I'd lan' on de yuther side, en
whah to pick up my track.  So I says, a raff is what I's arter; it doan'
_make_ no track.
I see a light a-comin' roun' de p'int bymeby, so I wade' in en shove'
a log ahead o' me en swum more'n half way acrost de river, en got in
'mongst de drift-wood, en kep' my head down low, en kinder swum agin de
current tell de raff come along.  Den I swum to de stern uv it en tuck
a-holt.  It clouded up en 'uz pooty dark for a little while.  So I clumb
up en laid down on de planks.  De men 'uz all 'way yonder in de middle,
whah de lantern wuz.  De river wuz a-risin', en dey wuz a good current;
so I reck'n'd 'at by fo' in de mawnin' I'd be twenty-five mile down de
river, en den I'd slip in jis b'fo' daylight en swim asho', en take to
de woods on de Illinois side.
But I didn' have no luck.  When we 'uz mos' down to de head er de
islan' a man begin to come aft wid de lantern, I see it warn't no use
fer to wait, so I slid overboard en struck out fer de islan'.  Well, I
had a notion I could lan' mos' anywhers, but I couldn't--bank too bluff.
I 'uz mos' to de foot er de islan' b'fo' I found' a good place.  I went
into de woods en jedged I wouldn' fool wid raffs no mo', long as dey
move de lantern roun' so.  I had my pipe en a plug er dog-leg, en some
matches in my cap, en dey warn't wet, so I 'uz all right.
And so you ain't had no meat nor bread to eat all this time?  Why
didn't you get mud-turkles?
How you gwyne to git 'm?  You can't slip up on um en grab um; en how's
a body gwyne to hit um wid a rock?  How could a body do it in de night?
En I warn't gwyne to show mysef on de bank in de daytime.
Well, that's so.  You've had to keep in the woods all the time, of
course. Did you hear 'em shooting the cannon?
Oh, yes.  I knowed dey was arter you.  I see um go by heah--watched um
thoo de bushes.
Some young birds come along, flying a yard or two at a time and
lighting. Jim said it was a sign it was going to rain.  He said it was
a sign when young chickens flew that way, and so he reckoned it was the
same way when young birds done it.  I was going to catch some of them,
but Jim wouldn't let me.  He said it was death.  He said his father laid
mighty sick once, and some of them catched a bird, and his old granny
said his father would die, and he did.
And Jim said you mustn't count the things you are going to cook for
dinner, because that would bring bad luck.  The same if you shook the
table-cloth after sundown.  And he said if a man owned a beehive
and that man died, the bees must be told about it before sun-up next
morning, or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die.
Jim said bees wouldn't sting idiots; but I didn't believe that, because
I had tried them lots of times myself, and they wouldn't sting me.
I had heard about some of these things before, but not all of them.  Jim
knowed all kinds of signs.  He said he knowed most everything.  I said
it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck, and so I asked
him if there warn't any good-luck signs.  He says:
Mighty few--an' _dey_ ain't no use to a body.  What you want to know
when good luck's a-comin' for?  Want to keep it off?  And he said:  Ef
you's got hairy arms en a hairy breas', it's a sign dat you's agwyne
to be rich. Well, dey's some use in a sign like dat, 'kase it's so fur
ahead. You see, maybe you's got to be po' a long time fust, en so you
might git discourage' en kill yo'sef 'f you didn' know by de sign dat
you gwyne to be rich bymeby.
Have you got hairy arms and a hairy breast, Jim?
What's de use to ax dat question?  Don't you see I has?
Well, are you rich?
No, but I ben rich wunst, and gwyne to be rich agin.  Wunst I had
foteen dollars, but I tuck to specalat'n', en got busted out.
What did you speculate in, Jim?
Well, fust I tackled stock.
What kind of stock?
Why, live stock--cattle, you know.  I put ten dollars in a cow.  But
I ain' gwyne to resk no mo' money in stock.  De cow up 'n' died on my
han's.
So you lost the ten dollars.
No, I didn't lose it all.  I on'y los' 'bout nine of it.  I sole de
hide en taller for a dollar en ten cents.
You had five dollars and ten cents left.  Did you speculate any more?
Yes.  You know that one-laigged nigger dat b'longs to old Misto
Bradish? Well, he sot up a bank, en say anybody dat put in a dollar
would git fo' dollars mo' at de en' er de year.  Well, all de niggers
went in, but dey didn't have much.  I wuz de on'y one dat had much.  So
I stuck out for mo' dan fo' dollars, en I said 'f I didn' git it I'd
start a bank mysef. Well, o' course dat nigger want' to keep me out er
de business, bekase he says dey warn't business 'nough for two banks, so
he say I could put in my five dollars en he pay me thirty-five at de en'
er de year.
So I done it.  Den I reck'n'd I'd inves' de thirty-five dollars right
off en keep things a-movin'.  Dey wuz a nigger name' Bob, dat had
ketched a wood-flat, en his marster didn' know it; en I bought it off'n
him en told him to take de thirty-five dollars when de en' er de
year come; but somebody stole de wood-flat dat night, en nex day de
one-laigged nigger say de bank's busted.  So dey didn' none uv us git no
money.
What did you do with the ten cents, Jim?
Well, I 'uz gwyne to spen' it, but I had a dream, en de dream tole me
to give it to a nigger name' Balum--Balum's Ass dey call him for short;
he's one er dem chuckleheads, you know.  But he's lucky, dey say, en I
see I warn't lucky.  De dream say let Balum inves' de ten cents en he'd
make a raise for me.  Well, Balum he tuck de money, en when he wuz in
church he hear de preacher say dat whoever give to de po' len' to de
Lord, en boun' to git his money back a hund'd times.  So Balum he tuck
en give de ten cents to de po', en laid low to see what wuz gwyne to
come of it.
Well, what did come of it, Jim?
Nuffn never come of it.  I couldn' manage to k'leck dat money no way;
en Balum he couldn'.  I ain' gwyne to len' no mo' money 'dout I see de
security.  Boun' to git yo' money back a hund'd times, de preacher says!
Ef I could git de ten _cents_ back, I'd call it squah, en be glad er de
chanst.
Well, it's all right anyway, Jim, long as you're going to be rich again
some time or other.
Yes; en I's rich now, come to look at it.  I owns mysef, en I's wuth
eight hund'd dollars.  I wisht I had de money, I wouldn' want no mo'.
CHAPTER IX.
I wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island
that I'd found when I was exploring; so we started and soon got to it,
because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile
wide.
This place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot
high. We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep and
the bushes so thick.  We tramped and clumb around all over it, and by
and by found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top on the
side towards Illinois.  The cavern was as big as two or three rooms
bunched together, and Jim could stand up straight in it.  It was cool in
there. Jim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said we
didn't want to be climbing up and down there all the time.
Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the traps
in the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island,
and they would never find us without dogs.  And, besides, he said them
little birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the things to
get wet?
So we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern,
and lugged all the traps up there.  Then we hunted up a place close by
to hide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows.  We took some fish off
of the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner.
The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one
side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat and a
good place to build a fire on.  So we built it there and cooked dinner.
We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner in there.
We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern.  Pretty
soon it darkened up, and begun to thunder and lighten; so the birds was
right about it.  Directly it begun to rain, and it rained like all fury,
too, and I never see the wind blow so.  It was one of these regular
summer storms.  It would get so dark that it looked all blue-black
outside, and lovely; and the rain would thrash along by so thick that
the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby; and here would
come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the
pale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gust would
follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they
was just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest and
blackest--_FST_! it was as bright as glory, and you'd have a little
glimpse of tree-tops a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm,
hundreds of yards further than you could see before; dark as sin again
in a second, and now you'd hear the thunder let go with an awful crash,
and then go rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards the
under side of the world, like rolling empty barrels down stairs--where
it's long stairs and they bounce a good deal, you know.
Jim, this is nice, I says.  I wouldn't want to be nowhere else but
here. Pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot corn-bread.
Well, you wouldn't a ben here 'f it hadn't a ben for Jim.  You'd a ben
down dah in de woods widout any dinner, en gittn' mos' drownded, too;
dat you would, honey.  Chickens knows when it's gwyne to rain, en so do
de birds, chile.
The river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days, till at
last it was over the banks.  The water was three or four foot deep on
the island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom.  On that side
it was a good many miles wide, but on the Missouri side it was the same
old distance across--a half a mile--because the Missouri shore was just a
wall of high bluffs.
Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe, It was mighty cool
and shady in the deep woods, even if the sun was blazing outside.  We
went winding in and out amongst the trees, and sometimes the vines hung
so thick we had to back away and go some other way.  Well, on every old
broken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things; and
when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame, on
account of being hungry, that you could paddle right up and put your
hand on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles--they would
slide off in the water.  The ridge our cavern was in was full of them.
We could a had pets enough if we'd wanted them.
One night we catched a little section of a lumber raft--nice pine planks.
It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long, and
the top stood above water six or seven inches--a solid, level floor.  We
could see saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes, but we let them go;
we didn't show ourselves in daylight.
Another night when we was up at the head of the island, just before
daylight, here comes a frame-house down, on the west side.  She was
a two-story, and tilted over considerable.  We paddled out and got
aboard--clumb in at an upstairs window.  But it was too dark to see yet,
so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight.
The light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island.  Then
we looked in at the window.  We could make out a bed, and a table, and
two old chairs, and lots of things around about on the floor, and there
was clothes hanging against the wall.  There was something laying on the
floor in the far corner that looked like a man.  So Jim says:
Hello, you!
But it didn't budge.  So I hollered again, and then Jim says:
De man ain't asleep--he's dead.  You hold still--I'll go en see.
He went, and bent down and looked, and says:
It's a dead man.  Yes, indeedy; naked, too.  He's ben shot in de back.
I reck'n he's ben dead two er three days.  Come in, Huck, but doan' look
at his face--it's too gashly.
I didn't look at him at all.  Jim throwed some old rags over him, but
he needn't done it; I didn't want to see him.  There was heaps of old
greasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old whisky bottles,
and a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all over the walls
was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal.
There was two old dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet, and some
women's underclothes hanging against the wall, and some men's clothing,
too.  We put the lot into the canoe--it might come good.  There was a
boy's old speckled straw hat on the floor; I took that, too.  And there
was a bottle that had had milk in it, and it had a rag stopper for a
baby to suck.  We would a took the bottle, but it was broke.  There was
a seedy old chest, and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke.  They
stood open, but there warn't nothing left in them that was any account.
The way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in a
hurry, and warn't fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff.
We got an old tin lantern, and a butcher-knife without any handle, and
a bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of tallow
candles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, and a ratty
old bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins and
beeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it, and a hatchet
and some nails, and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some
monstrous hooks on it, and a roll of buckskin, and a leather dog-collar,
and a horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn't have no label
on them; and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good curry-comb,
and Jim he found a ratty old fiddle-bow, and a wooden leg.  The straps
was broke off of it, but, barring that, it was a good enough leg, though
it was too long for me and not long enough for Jim, and we couldn't find
the other one, though we hunted all around.
And so, take it all around, we made a good haul.  When we was ready to
shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was pretty
broad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with the
quilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good
ways off.  I paddled over to the Illinois shore, and drifted down most
a half a mile doing it.  I crept up the dead water under the bank, and
hadn't no accidents and didn't see nobody.  We got home all safe.
CHAPTER X.
AFTER breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he
come to be killed, but Jim didn't want to.  He said it would fetch bad
luck; and besides, he said, he might come and ha'nt us; he said a man
that warn't buried was more likely to go a-ha'nting around than one
that was planted and comfortable.  That sounded pretty reasonable, so
I didn't say no more; but I couldn't keep from studying over it and
wishing I knowed who shot the man, and what they done it for.
We rummaged the clothes we'd got, and found eight dollars in silver
sewed up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat.  Jim said he reckoned
the people in that house stole the coat, because if they'd a knowed the
money was there they wouldn't a left it.  I said I reckoned they killed
him, too; but Jim didn't want to talk about that.  I says:
Now you think it's bad luck; but what did you say when I fetched in the
snake-skin that I found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday?
You said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snake-skin
with my hands.  Well, here's your bad luck!  We've raked in all this
truck and eight dollars besides.  I wish we could have some bad luck
like this every day, Jim.
Never you mind, honey, never you mind.  Don't you git too peart.  It's
a-comin'.  Mind I tell you, it's a-comin'.
It did come, too.  It was a Tuesday that we had that talk.  Well, after
dinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the
ridge, and got out of tobacco.  I went to the cavern to get some, and
found a rattlesnake in there.  I killed him, and curled him up on the
foot of Jim's blanket, ever so natural, thinking there'd be some fun
when Jim found him there.  Well, by night I forgot all about the snake,
and when Jim flung himself down on the blanket while I struck a light
the snake's mate was there, and bit him.
He jumped up yelling, and the first thing the light showed was the
varmint curled up and ready for another spring.  I laid him out in a
second with a stick, and Jim grabbed pap's whisky-jug and begun to pour
it down.
He was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel.  That all
comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave
a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it.  Jim told
me to chop off the snake's head and throw it away, and then skin the
body and roast a piece of it.  I done it, and he eat it and said it
would help cure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie them around
his wrist, too.  He said that that would help.  Then I slid out quiet
and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I warn't going
to let Jim find out it was all my fault, not if I could help it.
Jim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of his
head and pitched around and yelled; but every time he come to himself he
went to sucking at the jug again.  His foot swelled up pretty big, and
so did his leg; but by and by the drunk begun to come, and so I judged
he was all right; but I'd druther been bit with a snake than pap's
whisky.
Jim was laid up for four days and nights.  Then the swelling was all
gone and he was around again.  I made up my mind I wouldn't ever take
a-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands, now that I see what had come
of it. Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time.  And he said
that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn't
got to the end of it yet.  He said he druther see the new moon over his
left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake-skin
in his hand.  Well, I was getting to feel that way myself, though I've
always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is
one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do.  Old Hank
Bunker done it once, and bragged about it; and in less than two years he
got drunk and fell off of the shot-tower, and spread himself out so
that he was just a kind of a layer, as you may say; and they slid him
edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin, and buried him so, so
they say, but I didn't see it.  Pap told me.  But anyway it all come of
looking at the moon that way, like a fool.
Well, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks
again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big
hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was
as big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two
hundred pounds. We couldn't handle him, of course; he would a flung us
into Illinois.  We just set there and watched him rip and tear around
till he drownded.  We found a brass button in his stomach and a round
ball, and lots of rubbage.  We split the ball open with the hatchet,
and there was a spool in it.  Jim said he'd had it there a long time, to
coat it over so and make a ball of it.  It was as big a fish as was ever
catched in the Mississippi, I reckon.  Jim said he hadn't ever seen
a bigger one.  He would a been worth a good deal over at the village.
They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market-house
there; everybody buys some of him; his meat's as white as snow and makes
a good fry.
Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get a
stirring up some way.  I said I reckoned I would slip over the river and
find out what was going on.  Jim liked that notion; but he said I
must go in the dark and look sharp.  Then he studied it over and said,
couldn't I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl?
That was a good notion, too.  So we shortened up one of the calico
gowns, and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it.  Jim
hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit.  I put on the
sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a body to look in
and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe.  Jim said
nobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly.  I practiced around
all day to get the hang of the things, and by and by I could do pretty
well in them, only Jim said I didn't walk like a girl; and he said
I must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britches-pocket.  I took
notice, and done better.
I started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark.
I started across to the town from a little below the ferry-landing, and
the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town.  I
tied up and started along the bank.  There was a light burning in a
little shanty that hadn't been lived in for a long time, and I wondered
who had took up quarters there.  I slipped up and peeped in at the
window.  There was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by
a candle that was on a pine table.  I didn't know her face; she was a
stranger, for you couldn't start a face in that town that I didn't know.
Now this was lucky, because I was weakening; I was getting afraid I had
come; people might know my voice and find me out.  But if this woman had
been in such a little town two days she could tell me all I wanted to
know; so I knocked at the door, and made up my mind I wouldn't forget I
was a girl.
CHAPTER XI.
COME in, says the woman, and I did.  She says:  Take a cheer.
I done it.  She looked me all over with her little shiny eyes, and says:
What might your name be?
Sarah Williams.
Where 'bouts do you live?  In this neighborhood?'
No'm.  In Hookerville, seven mile below.  I've walked all the way and
I'm all tired out.
Hungry, too, I reckon.  I'll find you something.
No'm, I ain't hungry.  I was so hungry I had to stop two miles below
here at a farm; so I ain't hungry no more.  It's what makes me so late.
My mother's down sick, and out of money and everything, and I come to
tell my uncle Abner Moore.  He lives at the upper end of the town, she
says.  I hain't ever been here before.  Do you know him?
No; but I don't know everybody yet.  I haven't lived here quite two
weeks. It's a considerable ways to the upper end of the town.  You
better stay here all night.  Take off your bonnet.
No, I says; I'll rest a while, I reckon, and go on.  I ain't afeared
of the dark.
She said she wouldn't let me go by myself, but her husband would be in
by and by, maybe in a hour and a half, and she'd send him along with me.
Then she got to talking about her husband, and about her relations up
the river, and her relations down the river, and about how much better
off they used to was, and how they didn't know but they'd made a mistake
coming to our town, instead of letting well alone--and so on and so on,
till I was afeard I had made a mistake coming to her to find out what
was going on in the town; but by and by she dropped on to pap and the
murder, and then I was pretty willing to let her clatter right along.
She told about me and Tom Sawyer finding the six thousand dollars (only
she got it ten) and all about pap and what a hard lot he was, and what
a hard lot I was, and at last she got down to where I was murdered.  I
says:
Who done it?  We've heard considerable about these goings on down in
Hookerville, but we don't know who 'twas that killed Huck Finn.
Well, I reckon there's a right smart chance of people _here_ that'd
like to know who killed him.  Some think old Finn done it himself.
No--is that so?
Most everybody thought it at first.  He'll never know how nigh he come
to getting lynched.  But before night they changed around and judged it
was done by a runaway nigger named Jim.
Why _he_--
I stopped.  I reckoned I better keep still.  She run on, and never
noticed I had put in at all:
The nigger run off the very night Huck Finn was killed.  So there's a
reward out for him--three hundred dollars.  And there's a reward out for
old Finn, too--two hundred dollars.  You see, he come to town the
morning after the murder, and told about it, and was out with 'em on the
ferryboat hunt, and right away after he up and left.  Before night they
wanted to lynch him, but he was gone, you see.  Well, next day they
found out the nigger was gone; they found out he hadn't ben seen sence
ten o'clock the night the murder was done.  So then they put it on him,
you see; and while they was full of it, next day, back comes old Finn,
and went boo-hooing to Judge Thatcher to get money to hunt for the
nigger all over Illinois with. The judge gave him some, and that evening
he got drunk, and was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty
hard-looking strangers, and then went off with them.  Well, he hain't
come back sence, and they ain't looking for him back till this thing
blows over a little, for people thinks now that he killed his boy and
fixed things so folks would think robbers done it, and then he'd get
Huck's money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit.
People do say he warn't any too good to do it.  Oh, he's sly, I reckon.
If he don't come back for a year he'll be all right.  You can't prove
anything on him, you know; everything will be quieted down then, and
he'll walk in Huck's money as easy as nothing.
Yes, I reckon so, 'm.  I don't see nothing in the way of it.  Has
everybody quit thinking the nigger done it?
Oh, no, not everybody.  A good many thinks he done it.  But they'll get
the nigger pretty soon now, and maybe they can scare it out of him.
Why, are they after him yet?
Well, you're innocent, ain't you!  Does three hundred dollars lay
around every day for people to pick up?  Some folks think the nigger
ain't far from here.  I'm one of them--but I hain't talked it around.  A
few days ago I was talking with an old couple that lives next door in
the log shanty, and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to
that island over yonder that they call Jackson's Island.  Don't anybody
live there? says I. No, nobody, says they.  I didn't say any more, but
I done some thinking.  I was pretty near certain I'd seen smoke over
there, about the head of the island, a day or two before that, so I says
to myself, like as not that nigger's hiding over there; anyway, says
I, it's worth the trouble to give the place a hunt.  I hain't seen any
smoke sence, so I reckon maybe he's gone, if it was him; but husband's
going over to see--him and another man.  He was gone up the river; but he
got back to-day, and I told him as soon as he got here two hours ago.
I had got so uneasy I couldn't set still.  I had to do something with my
hands; so I took up a needle off of the table and went to threading
it. My hands shook, and I was making a bad job of it.  When the woman
stopped talking I looked up, and she was looking at me pretty curious
and smiling a little.  I put down the needle and thread, and let on to
be interested--and I was, too--and says:
Three hundred dollars is a power of money.  I wish my mother could get
it. Is your husband going over there to-night?
Oh, yes.  He went up-town with the man I was telling you of, to get a
boat and see if they could borrow another gun.  They'll go over after
midnight.
Couldn't they see better if they was to wait till daytime?
Yes.  And couldn't the nigger see better, too?  After midnight he'll
likely be asleep, and they can slip around through the woods and hunt up
his camp fire all the better for the dark, if he's got one.
I didn't think of that.
The woman kept looking at me pretty curious, and I didn't feel a bit
comfortable.  Pretty soon she says,
What did you say your name was, honey?
M--Mary Williams.
Somehow it didn't seem to me that I said it was Mary before, so I didn't
look up--seemed to me I said it was Sarah; so I felt sort of cornered,
and was afeared maybe I was looking it, too.  I wished the woman would
say something more; the longer she set still the uneasier I was.  But
now she says:
Honey, I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in?
Oh, yes'm, I did.  Sarah Mary Williams.  Sarah's my first name.  Some
calls me Sarah, some calls me Mary.
Oh, that's the way of it?
Yes'm.
I was feeling better then, but I wished I was out of there, anyway.  I
couldn't look up yet.
Well, the woman fell to talking about how hard times was, and how poor
they had to live, and how the rats was as free as if they owned the
place, and so forth and so on, and then I got easy again.  She was right
about the rats. You'd see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner
every little while.  She said she had to have things handy to throw at
them when she was alone, or they wouldn't give her no peace.  She showed
me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said she was a good shot
with it generly, but she'd wrenched her arm a day or two ago, and didn't
know whether she could throw true now.  But she watched for a chance,
and directly banged away at a rat; but she missed him wide, and said
Ouch! it hurt her arm so.  Then she told me to try for the next one.
I wanted to be getting away before the old man got back, but of course
I didn't let on.  I got the thing, and the first rat that showed his
nose I let drive, and if he'd a stayed where he was he'd a been a
tolerable sick rat.  She said that was first-rate, and she reckoned I
would hive the next one.  She went and got the lump of lead and fetched
it back, and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help
her with.  I held up my two hands and she put the hank over them, and
went on talking about her and her husband's matters.  But she broke off
to say:
Keep your eye on the rats.  You better have the lead in your lap,
handy.
So she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment, and I clapped
my legs together on it and she went on talking.  But only about a
minute. Then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face,
and very pleasant, and says:
Come, now, what's your real name?
Wh--what, mum?
What's your real name?  Is it Bill, or Tom, or Bob?--or what is it?
I reckon I shook like a leaf, and I didn't know hardly what to do.  But
I says:
Please to don't poke fun at a poor girl like me, mum.  If I'm in the
way here, I'll--
No, you won't.  Set down and stay where you are.  I ain't going to hurt
you, and I ain't going to tell on you, nuther.  You just tell me your
secret, and trust me.  I'll keep it; and, what's more, I'll help
you. So'll my old man if you want him to.  You see, you're a runaway
'prentice, that's all.  It ain't anything.  There ain't no harm in it.
You've been treated bad, and you made up your mind to cut.  Bless you,
child, I wouldn't tell on you.  Tell me all about it now, that's a good
boy.
So I said it wouldn't be no use to try to play it any longer, and I
would just make a clean breast and tell her everything, but she musn't
go back on her promise.  Then I told her my father and mother was dead,
and the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty
mile back from the river, and he treated me so bad I couldn't stand it
no longer; he went away to be gone a couple of days, and so I took my
chance and stole some of his daughter's old clothes and cleared out, and
I had been three nights coming the thirty miles.  I traveled nights,
and hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried from
home lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty.  I said I believed my
uncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and so that was why I struck
out for this town of Goshen.
Goshen, child?  This ain't Goshen.  This is St. Petersburg.  Goshen's
ten mile further up the river.  Who told you this was Goshen?
Why, a man I met at daybreak this morning, just as I was going to turn
into the woods for my regular sleep.  He told me when the roads forked I
must take the right hand, and five mile would fetch me to Goshen.
He was drunk, I reckon.  He told you just exactly wrong.
Well, he did act like he was drunk, but it ain't no matter now.  I got
to be moving along.  I'll fetch Goshen before daylight.
Hold on a minute.  I'll put you up a snack to eat.  You might want it.
So she put me up a snack, and says:
Say, when a cow's laying down, which end of her gets up first?  Answer
up prompt now--don't stop to study over it.  Which end gets up first?
The hind end, mum.
Well, then, a horse?
The for'rard end, mum.
Which side of a tree does the moss grow on?
North side.
If fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside, how many of them eats with
their heads pointed the same direction?
The whole fifteen, mum.
Well, I reckon you _have_ lived in the country.  I thought maybe you
was trying to hocus me again.  What's your real name, now?
George Peters, mum.
Well, try to remember it, George.  Don't forget and tell me it's
Elexander before you go, and then get out by saying it's George
Elexander when I catch you.  And don't go about women in that old
calico.  You do a girl tolerable poor, but you might fool men, maybe.
Bless you, child, when you set out to thread a needle don't hold the
thread still and fetch the needle up to it; hold the needle still and
poke the thread at it; that's the way a woman most always does, but a
man always does t'other way.  And when you throw at a rat or anything,
hitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as
awkward as you can, and miss your rat about six or seven foot. Throw
stiff-armed from the shoulder, like there was a pivot there for it to
turn on, like a girl; not from the wrist and elbow, with your arm out
to one side, like a boy.  And, mind you, when a girl tries to catch
anything in her lap she throws her knees apart; she don't clap them
together, the way you did when you catched the lump of lead.  Why, I
spotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle; and I contrived
the other things just to make certain.  Now trot along to your uncle,
Sarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters, and if you get into trouble
you send word to Mrs. Judith Loftus, which is me, and I'll do what I can
to get you out of it.  Keep the river road all the way, and next time
you tramp take shoes and socks with you. The river road's a rocky one,
and your feet'll be in a condition when you get to Goshen, I reckon.
I went up the bank about fifty yards, and then I doubled on my tracks
and slipped back to where my canoe was, a good piece below the house.  I
jumped in, and was off in a hurry.  I went up-stream far enough to
make the head of the island, and then started across.  I took off the
sun-bonnet, for I didn't want no blinders on then.  When I was about the
middle I heard the clock begin to strike, so I stops and listens; the
sound come faint over the water but clear--eleven.  When I struck the
head of the island I never waited to blow, though I was most winded, but
I shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be, and started
a good fire there on a high and dry spot.
Then I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place, a mile and a half
below, as hard as I could go.  I landed, and slopped through the timber
and up the ridge and into the cavern.  There Jim laid, sound asleep on
the ground.  I roused him out and says:
Git up and hump yourself, Jim!  There ain't a minute to lose.  They're
after us!
Jim never asked no questions, he never said a word; but the way he
worked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared.  By
that time everything we had in the world was on our raft, and she was
ready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid.  We
put out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing, and didn't show a
candle outside after that.
I took the canoe out from the shore a little piece, and took a look;
but if there was a boat around I couldn't see it, for stars and shadows
ain't good to see by.  Then we got out the raft and slipped along down
in the shade, past the foot of the island dead still--never saying a
word.
CHAPTER XII.
IT must a been close on to one o'clock when we got below the island at
last, and the raft did seem to go mighty slow.  If a boat was to come
along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois
shore; and it was well a boat didn't come, for we hadn't ever thought to
put the gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line, or anything to eat.  We
was in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things.  It warn't
good judgment to put _everything_ on the raft.
If the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire I
built, and watched it all night for Jim to come.  Anyways, they stayed
away from us, and if my building the fire never fooled them it warn't no
fault of mine.  I played it as low down on them as I could.
When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a
big bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches with
the hatchet, and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there
had been a cave-in in the bank there.  A tow-head is a sandbar that has
cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth.
We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois
side, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we
warn't afraid of anybody running across us.  We laid there all day,
and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and
up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle.  I told Jim all
about the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she was
a smart one, and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn't set
down and watch a camp fire--no, sir, she'd fetch a dog.  Well, then, I
said, why couldn't she tell her husband to fetch a dog?  Jim said he
bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and he
believed they must a gone up-town to get a dog and so they lost all that
time, or else we wouldn't be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile
below the village--no, indeedy, we would be in that same old town again.
So I said I didn't care what was the reason they didn't get us as long
as they didn't.
When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the
cottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight;
so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug
wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things
dry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above
the level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out of
reach of steamboat waves.  Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a
layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for
to hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather
or chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen.  We made an extra
steering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag
or something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern
on, because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat
coming down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn't have
to light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they call
a crossing; for the river was pretty high yet, very low banks being
still a little under water; so up-bound boats didn't always run the
channel, but hunted easy water.
This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current
that was making over four mile an hour.  We catched fish and talked,
and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness.  It was kind of
solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking
up at the stars, and we didn't ever feel like talking loud, and it
warn't often that we laughed--only a little kind of a low chuckle.  We
had mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to
us at all--that night, nor the next, nor the next.
Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides,
nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see.  The
fifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up.
In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand
people in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderful
spread of lights at two o'clock that still night.  There warn't a sound
there; everybody was asleep.
Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o'clock at some little
village, and buy ten or fifteen cents' worth of meal or bacon or other
stuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn't roosting
comfortable, and took him along.  Pap always said, take a chicken when
you get a chance, because if you don't want him yourself you can easy
find somebody that does, and a good deed ain't ever forgot.  I never see
pap when he didn't want the chicken himself, but that is what he used to
say, anyway.
Mornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed a
watermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things of
that kind.  Pap always said it warn't no harm to borrow things if you
was meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it warn't
anything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it.
Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly
right; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things
from the list and say we wouldn't borrow them any more--then he reckoned
it wouldn't be no harm to borrow the others.  So we talked it over all
one night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up our minds
whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the mushmelons,
or what.  But towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory, and
concluded to drop crabapples and p'simmons.  We warn't feeling just
right before that, but it was all comfortable now.  I was glad the way
it come out, too, because crabapples ain't ever good, and the p'simmons
wouldn't be ripe for two or three months yet.
We shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning
or didn't go to bed early enough in the evening.  Take it all round, we
lived pretty high.
The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight, with
a power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solid
sheet. We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself.
When the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead,
and high, rocky bluffs on both sides.  By and by says I, Hel-_lo_, Jim,
looky yonder! It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock.
We was drifting straight down for her.  The lightning showed her very
distinct.  She was leaning over, with part of her upper deck above
water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear, and a
chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it,
when the flashes come.
Well, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so mysterious-like,
I felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck
laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river.  I
wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little, and see what
there was there.  So I says:
Le's land on her, Jim.
But Jim was dead against it at first.  He says:
I doan' want to go fool'n 'long er no wrack.  We's doin' blame' well,
en we better let blame' well alone, as de good book says.  Like as not
dey's a watchman on dat wrack.
Watchman your grandmother, I says; there ain't nothing to watch but
the texas and the pilot-house; and do you reckon anybody's going to resk
his life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this, when
it's likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute?  Jim
couldn't say nothing to that, so he didn't try.  And besides, I says,
we might borrow something worth having out of the captain's stateroom.
Seegars, I bet you--and cost five cents apiece, solid cash.  Steamboat
captains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and _they_ don't
care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want it.  Stick a
candle in your pocket; I can't rest, Jim, till we give her a rummaging.
Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this thing?  Not for pie, he
wouldn't. He'd call it an adventure--that's what he'd call it; and he'd
land on that wreck if it was his last act.  And wouldn't he throw style
into it?--wouldn't he spread himself, nor nothing?  Why, you'd think it
was Christopher C'lumbus discovering Kingdom-Come.  I wish Tom Sawyer
_was_ here.
Jim he grumbled a little, but give in.  He said we mustn't talk any more
than we could help, and then talk mighty low.  The lightning showed us
the wreck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboard derrick, and
made fast there.
The deck was high out here.  We went sneaking down the slope of it to
labboard, in the dark, towards the texas, feeling our way slow with our
feet, and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys, for it was so
dark we couldn't see no sign of them.  Pretty soon we struck the forward
end of the skylight, and clumb on to it; and the next step fetched us in
front of the captain's door, which was open, and by Jimminy, away down
through the texas-hall we see a light! and all in the same second we
seem to hear low voices in yonder!
Jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick, and told me to come
along.  I says, all right, and was going to start for the raft; but just
then I heard a voice wail out and say:
Oh, please don't, boys; I swear I won't ever tell!
Another voice said, pretty loud:
It's a lie, Jim Turner.  You've acted this way before.  You always want
more'n your share of the truck, and you've always got it, too, because
you've swore 't if you didn't you'd tell.  But this time you've said
it jest one time too many.  You're the meanest, treacherousest hound in
this country.
By this time Jim was gone for the raft.  I was just a-biling with
curiosity; and I says to myself, Tom Sawyer wouldn't back out now,
and so I won't either; I'm a-going to see what's going on here.  So I
dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage, and crept aft
in the dark till there warn't but one stateroom betwixt me and the
cross-hall of the texas.  Then in there I see a man stretched on the
floor and tied hand and foot, and two men standing over him, and one
of them had a dim lantern in his hand, and the other one had a pistol.
This one kept pointing the pistol at the man's head on the floor, and
saying:
I'd _like_ to!  And I orter, too--a mean skunk!
The man on the floor would shrivel up and say, Oh, please don't, Bill;
I hain't ever goin' to tell.
And every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and
say:
'Deed you _ain't!_  You never said no truer thing 'n that, you bet
you. And once he said:  Hear him beg! and yit if we hadn't got the
best of him and tied him he'd a killed us both.  And what _for_?  Jist
for noth'n. Jist because we stood on our _rights_--that's what for.  But
I lay you ain't a-goin' to threaten nobody any more, Jim Turner.  Put
_up_ that pistol, Bill.
Bill says:
I don't want to, Jake Packard.  I'm for killin' him--and didn't he kill
old Hatfield jist the same way--and don't he deserve it?
But I don't _want_ him killed, and I've got my reasons for it.
Bless yo' heart for them words, Jake Packard!  I'll never forgit you
long's I live! says the man on the floor, sort of blubbering.
Packard didn't take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a nail
and started towards where I was there in the dark, and motioned Bill
to come.  I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but the boat
slanted so that I couldn't make very good time; so to keep from getting
run over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side.
The man came a-pawing along in the dark, and when Packard got to my
stateroom, he says:
Here--come in here.
And in he come, and Bill after him.  But before they got in I was up
in the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come.  Then they stood there,
with their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked.  I couldn't see
them, but I could tell where they was by the whisky they'd been having.
I was glad I didn't drink whisky; but it wouldn't made much difference
anyway, because most of the time they couldn't a treed me because I
didn't breathe.  I was too scared.  And, besides, a body _couldn't_
breathe and hear such talk.  They talked low and earnest.  Bill wanted
to kill Turner.  He says:
He's said he'll tell, and he will.  If we was to give both our shares
to him _now_ it wouldn't make no difference after the row and the way
we've served him.  Shore's you're born, he'll turn State's evidence; now
you hear _me_.  I'm for putting him out of his troubles.
So'm I, says Packard, very quiet.
Blame it, I'd sorter begun to think you wasn't.  Well, then, that's all
right.  Le's go and do it.
Hold on a minute; I hain't had my say yit.  You listen to me.
Shooting's good, but there's quieter ways if the thing's _got_ to be
done. But what I say is this:  it ain't good sense to go court'n around
after a halter if you can git at what you're up to in some way that's
jist as good and at the same time don't bring you into no resks.  Ain't
that so?
You bet it is.  But how you goin' to manage it this time?
Well, my idea is this:  we'll rustle around and gather up whatever
pickins we've overlooked in the staterooms, and shove for shore and hide
the truck. Then we'll wait.  Now I say it ain't a-goin' to be more'n two
hours befo' this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river.  See?
He'll be drownded, and won't have nobody to blame for it but his own
self.  I reckon that's a considerble sight better 'n killin' of him.
I'm unfavorable to killin' a man as long as you can git aroun' it; it
ain't good sense, it ain't good morals.  Ain't I right?
Yes, I reck'n you are.  But s'pose she _don't_ break up and wash off?
Well, we can wait the two hours anyway and see, can't we?
All right, then; come along.
So they started, and I lit out, all in a cold sweat, and scrambled
forward. It was dark as pitch there; but I said, in a kind of a coarse
whisper, Jim! and he answered up, right at my elbow, with a sort of a
moan, and I says:
Quick, Jim, it ain't no time for fooling around and moaning; there's a
gang of murderers in yonder, and if we don't hunt up their boat and set
her drifting down the river so these fellows can't get away from the
wreck there's one of 'em going to be in a bad fix.  But if we find their
boat we can put _all_ of 'em in a bad fix--for the sheriff 'll get 'em.
Quick--hurry!  I'll hunt the labboard side, you hunt the stabboard. You
start at the raft, and--
Oh, my lordy, lordy!  _raf'_?  Dey ain' no raf' no mo'; she done broke
loose en gone I--en here we is!
CHAPTER XIII.
WELL, I catched my breath and most fainted.  Shut up on a wreck with
such a gang as that!  But it warn't no time to be sentimentering.  We'd
_got_ to find that boat now--had to have it for ourselves.  So we went
a-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side, and slow work it was,
too--seemed a week before we got to the stern.  No sign of a boat.  Jim
said he didn't believe he could go any further--so scared he hadn't
hardly any strength left, he said.  But I said, come on, if we get left
on this wreck we are in a fix, sure.  So on we prowled again.  We struck
for the stern of the texas, and found it, and then scrabbled along
forwards on the skylight, hanging on from shutter to shutter, for the
edge of the skylight was in the water.  When we got pretty close to the
cross-hall door there was the skiff, sure enough!  I could just barely
see her.  I felt ever so thankful.  In another second I would a been
aboard of her, but just then the door opened.  One of the men stuck his
head out only about a couple of foot from me, and I thought I was gone;
but he jerked it in again, and says:
Heave that blame lantern out o' sight, Bill!
He flung a bag of something into the boat, and then got in himself and
set down.  It was Packard.  Then Bill _he_ come out and got in.  Packard
says, in a low voice:
All ready--shove off!
I couldn't hardly hang on to the shutters, I was so weak.  But Bill
says:
Hold on--'d you go through him?
No.  Didn't you?
No.  So he's got his share o' the cash yet.
Well, then, come along; no use to take truck and leave money.
Say, won't he suspicion what we're up to?
Maybe he won't.  But we got to have it anyway. Come along.
So they got out and went in.
The door slammed to because it was on the careened side; and in a half
second I was in the boat, and Jim come tumbling after me.  I out with my
knife and cut the rope, and away we went!
We didn't touch an oar, and we didn't speak nor whisper, nor hardly even
breathe.  We went gliding swift along, dead silent, past the tip of the
paddle-box, and past the stern; then in a second or two more we was a
hundred yards below the wreck, and the darkness soaked her up, every
last sign of her, and we was safe, and knowed it.
When we was three or four hundred yards down-stream we see the lantern
show like a little spark at the texas door for a second, and we knowed
by that that the rascals had missed their boat, and was beginning to
understand that they was in just as much trouble now as Jim Turner was.
Then Jim manned the oars, and we took out after our raft.  Now was the
first time that I begun to worry about the men--I reckon I hadn't
had time to before.  I begun to think how dreadful it was, even for
murderers, to be in such a fix.  I says to myself, there ain't no
telling but I might come to be a murderer myself yet, and then how would
I like it?  So says I to Jim:
The first light we see we'll land a hundred yards below it or above
it, in a place where it's a good hiding-place for you and the skiff, and
then I'll go and fix up some kind of a yarn, and get somebody to go for
that gang and get them out of their scrape, so they can be hung when
their time comes.
But that idea was a failure; for pretty soon it begun to storm again,
and this time worse than ever.  The rain poured down, and never a light
showed; everybody in bed, I reckon.  We boomed along down the river,
watching for lights and watching for our raft.  After a long time the
rain let up, but the clouds stayed, and the lightning kept whimpering,
and by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead, floating, and we
made for it.
It was the raft, and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again.  We
seen a light now away down to the right, on shore.  So I said I would
go for it. The skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole
there on the wreck.  We hustled it on to the raft in a pile, and I told
Jim to float along down, and show a light when he judged he had gone
about two mile, and keep it burning till I come; then I manned my oars
and shoved for the light.  As I got down towards it three or four more
showed--up on a hillside.  It was a village.  I closed in above the shore
light, and laid on my oars and floated.  As I went by I see it was a
lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double-hull ferryboat.  I skimmed
around for the watchman, a-wondering whereabouts he slept; and by and
by I found him roosting on the bitts forward, with his head down between
his knees.  I gave his shoulder two or three little shoves, and begun to
cry.
He stirred up in a kind of a startlish way; but when he see it was only
me he took a good gap and stretch, and then he says:
Hello, what's up?  Don't cry, bub.  What's the trouble?
I says:
Pap, and mam, and sis, and--
Then I broke down.  He says:
Oh, dang it now, _don't_ take on so; we all has to have our troubles,
and this 'n 'll come out all right.  What's the matter with 'em?
They're--they're--are you the watchman of the boat?
Yes, he says, kind of pretty-well-satisfied like.  I'm the captain
and the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head
deck-hand; and sometimes I'm the freight and passengers.  I ain't as
rich as old Jim Hornback, and I can't be so blame' generous and good
to Tom, Dick, and Harry as what he is, and slam around money the way he
does; but I've told him a many a time 't I wouldn't trade places with
him; for, says I, a sailor's life's the life for me, and I'm derned if
_I'd_ live two mile out o' town, where there ain't nothing ever goin'
on, not for all his spondulicks and as much more on top of it.  Says I--
I broke in and says:
They're in an awful peck of trouble, and--
_Who_ is?
Why, pap and mam and sis and Miss Hooker; and if you'd take your
ferryboat and go up there--
Up where?  Where are they?
On the wreck.
What wreck?
Why, there ain't but one.
What, you don't mean the Walter Scott?
Yes.
Good land! what are they doin' _there_, for gracious sakes?
Well, they didn't go there a-purpose.
I bet they didn't!  Why, great goodness, there ain't no chance for 'em
if they don't git off mighty quick!  Why, how in the nation did they
ever git into such a scrape?
Easy enough.  Miss Hooker was a-visiting up there to the town--
Yes, Booth's Landing--go on.
She was a-visiting there at Booth's Landing, and just in the edge of
the evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horse-ferry
to stay all night at her friend's house, Miss What-you-may-call-her I
disremember her name--and they lost their steering-oar, and swung
around and went a-floating down, stern first, about two mile, and
saddle-baggsed on the wreck, and the ferryman and the nigger woman and
the horses was all lost, but Miss Hooker she made a grab and got aboard
the wreck.  Well, about an hour after dark we come along down in our
trading-scow, and it was so dark we didn't notice the wreck till we was
right on it; and so _we_ saddle-baggsed; but all of us was saved but
Bill Whipple--and oh, he _was_ the best cretur!--I most wish 't it had
been me, I do.
My George!  It's the beatenest thing I ever struck.  And _then_ what
did you all do?
Well, we hollered and took on, but it's so wide there we couldn't
make nobody hear.  So pap said somebody got to get ashore and get help
somehow. I was the only one that could swim, so I made a dash for it,
and Miss Hooker she said if I didn't strike help sooner, come here and
hunt up her uncle, and he'd fix the thing.  I made the land about a mile
below, and been fooling along ever since, trying to get people to do
something, but they said, 'What, in such a night and such a current?
There ain't no sense in it; go for the steam ferry.'  Now if you'll go
and--
By Jackson, I'd _like_ to, and, blame it, I don't know but I will; but
who in the dingnation's a-going' to _pay_ for it?  Do you reckon your
pap--
Why _that's_ all right.  Miss Hooker she tole me, _particular_, that
her uncle Hornback--
Great guns! is _he_ her uncle?  Looky here, you break for that light
over yonder-way, and turn out west when you git there, and about a
quarter of a mile out you'll come to the tavern; tell 'em to dart you
out to Jim Hornback's, and he'll foot the bill.  And don't you fool
around any, because he'll want to know the news.  Tell him I'll have
his niece all safe before he can get to town.  Hump yourself, now; I'm
a-going up around the corner here to roust out my engineer.
I struck for the light, but as soon as he turned the corner I went back
and got into my skiff and bailed her out, and then pulled up shore in
the easy water about six hundred yards, and tucked myself in among
some woodboats; for I couldn't rest easy till I could see the ferryboat
start. But take it all around, I was feeling ruther comfortable on
accounts of taking all this trouble for that gang, for not many would
a done it.  I wished the widow knowed about it.  I judged she would be
proud of me for helping these rapscallions, because rapscallions and
dead beats is the kind the widow and good people takes the most interest
in.
Well, before long here comes the wreck, dim and dusky, sliding along
down! A kind of cold shiver went through me, and then I struck out for
her.  She was very deep, and I see in a minute there warn't much chance
for anybody being alive in her.  I pulled all around her and hollered
a little, but there wasn't any answer; all dead still.  I felt a little
bit heavy-hearted about the gang, but not much, for I reckoned if they
could stand it I could.
Then here comes the ferryboat; so I shoved for the middle of the river
on a long down-stream slant; and when I judged I was out of eye-reach
I laid on my oars, and looked back and see her go and smell around the
wreck for Miss Hooker's remainders, because the captain would know her
uncle Hornback would want them; and then pretty soon the ferryboat give
it up and went for the shore, and I laid into my work and went a-booming
down the river.
It did seem a powerful long time before Jim's light showed up; and when
it did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off.  By the time I
got there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east; so we
struck for an island, and hid the raft, and sunk the skiff, and turned
in and slept like dead people.
CHAPTER XIV.
BY and by, when we got up, we turned over the truck the gang had stole
off of the wreck, and found boots, and blankets, and clothes, and all
sorts of other things, and a lot of books, and a spyglass, and three
boxes of seegars.  We hadn't ever been this rich before in neither of
our lives.  The seegars was prime.  We laid off all the afternoon in the
woods talking, and me reading the books, and having a general good
time. I told Jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at the
ferryboat, and I said these kinds of things was adventures; but he said
he didn't want no more adventures.  He said that when I went in the
texas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone he
nearly died, because he judged it was all up with _him_ anyway it could
be fixed; for if he didn't get saved he would get drownded; and if he
did get saved, whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get
the reward, and then Miss Watson would sell him South, sure.  Well, he
was right; he was most always right; he had an uncommon level head for a
nigger.
I read considerable to Jim about kings and dukes and earls and such, and
how gaudy they dressed, and how much style they put on, and called each
other your majesty, and your grace, and your lordship, and so on, 'stead
of mister; and Jim's eyes bugged out, and he was interested.  He says:
I didn' know dey was so many un um.  I hain't hearn 'bout none un um,
skasely, but ole King Sollermun, onless you counts dem kings dat's in a
pack er k'yards.  How much do a king git?
Get?  I says; why, they get a thousand dollars a month if they want
it; they can have just as much as they want; everything belongs to
them.
_Ain'_ dat gay?  En what dey got to do, Huck?
_They_ don't do nothing!  Why, how you talk! They just set around.
No; is dat so?
Of course it is.  They just set around--except, maybe, when there's a
war; then they go to the war.  But other times they just lazy around; or
go hawking--just hawking and sp--Sh!--d' you hear a noise?
We skipped out and looked; but it warn't nothing but the flutter of a
steamboat's wheel away down, coming around the point; so we come back.
Yes, says I, and other times, when things is dull, they fuss with the
parlyment; and if everybody don't go just so he whacks their heads off.
But mostly they hang round the harem.
Roun' de which?
Harem.
What's de harem?
The place where he keeps his wives.  Don't you know about the harem?
Solomon had one; he had about a million wives.
Why, yes, dat's so; I--I'd done forgot it.  A harem's a bo'd'n-house, I
reck'n.  Mos' likely dey has rackety times in de nussery.  En I reck'n
de wives quarrels considable; en dat 'crease de racket.  Yit dey say
Sollermun de wises' man dat ever live'.  I doan' take no stock in
dat. Bekase why: would a wise man want to live in de mids' er sich a
blim-blammin' all de time?  No--'deed he wouldn't.  A wise man 'ud take
en buil' a biler-factry; en den he could shet _down_ de biler-factry
when he want to res'.
Well, but he _was_ the wisest man, anyway; because the widow she told
me so, her own self.
I doan k'yer what de widder say, he _warn't_ no wise man nuther.  He
had some er de dad-fetchedes' ways I ever see.  Does you know 'bout dat
chile dat he 'uz gwyne to chop in two?
Yes, the widow told me all about it.
_Well_, den!  Warn' dat de beatenes' notion in de worl'?  You jes'
take en look at it a minute.  Dah's de stump, dah--dat's one er de women;
heah's you--dat's de yuther one; I's Sollermun; en dish yer dollar bill's
de chile.  Bofe un you claims it.  What does I do?  Does I shin aroun'
mongs' de neighbors en fine out which un you de bill _do_ b'long to, en
han' it over to de right one, all safe en soun', de way dat anybody dat
had any gumption would?  No; I take en whack de bill in _two_, en give
half un it to you, en de yuther half to de yuther woman.  Dat's de way
Sollermun was gwyne to do wid de chile.  Now I want to ast you:  what's
de use er dat half a bill?--can't buy noth'n wid it.  En what use is a
half a chile?  I wouldn' give a dern for a million un um.
But hang it, Jim, you've clean missed the point--blame it, you've missed
it a thousand mile.
Who?  Me?  Go 'long.  Doan' talk to me 'bout yo' pints.  I reck'n I
knows sense when I sees it; en dey ain' no sense in sich doin's as
dat. De 'spute warn't 'bout a half a chile, de 'spute was 'bout a whole
chile; en de man dat think he kin settle a 'spute 'bout a whole chile
wid a half a chile doan' know enough to come in out'n de rain.  Doan'
talk to me 'bout Sollermun, Huck, I knows him by de back.
But I tell you you don't get the point.
Blame de point!  I reck'n I knows what I knows.  En mine you, de _real_
pint is down furder--it's down deeper.  It lays in de way Sollermun was
raised.  You take a man dat's got on'y one or two chillen; is dat man
gwyne to be waseful o' chillen?  No, he ain't; he can't 'ford it.  _He_
know how to value 'em.  But you take a man dat's got 'bout five million
chillen runnin' roun' de house, en it's diffunt.  _He_ as soon chop a
chile in two as a cat. Dey's plenty mo'.  A chile er two, mo' er less,
warn't no consekens to Sollermun, dad fatch him!
I never see such a nigger.  If he got a notion in his head once, there
warn't no getting it out again.  He was the most down on Solomon of
any nigger I ever see.  So I went to talking about other kings, and let
Solomon slide.  I told about Louis Sixteenth that got his head cut off
in France long time ago; and about his little boy the dolphin, that
would a been a king, but they took and shut him up in jail, and some say
he died there.
Po' little chap.
But some says he got out and got away, and come to America.
Dat's good!  But he'll be pooty lonesome--dey ain' no kings here, is
dey, Huck?
No.
Den he cain't git no situation.  What he gwyne to do?
Well, I don't know.  Some of them gets on the police, and some of them
learns people how to talk French.
Why, Huck, doan' de French people talk de same way we does?
_No_, Jim; you couldn't understand a word they said--not a single word.
Well, now, I be ding-busted!  How do dat come?
I don't know; but it's so.  I got some of their jabber out of a book.
S'pose a man was to come to you and say Polly-voo-franzy--what would you
think?
I wouldn' think nuff'n; I'd take en bust him over de head--dat is, if he
warn't white.  I wouldn't 'low no nigger to call me dat.
Shucks, it ain't calling you anything.  It's only saying, do you know
how to talk French?
Well, den, why couldn't he _say_ it?
Why, he _is_ a-saying it.  That's a Frenchman's _way_ of saying it.
Well, it's a blame ridicklous way, en I doan' want to hear no mo' 'bout
it.  Dey ain' no sense in it.
Looky here, Jim; does a cat talk like we do?
No, a cat don't.
Well, does a cow?
No, a cow don't, nuther.
Does a cat talk like a cow, or a cow talk like a cat?
No, dey don't.
It's natural and right for 'em to talk different from each other, ain't
it?
Course.
And ain't it natural and right for a cat and a cow to talk different
from _us_?
Why, mos' sholy it is.
Well, then, why ain't it natural and right for a _Frenchman_ to talk
different from us?  You answer me that.
Is a cat a man, Huck?
No.
Well, den, dey ain't no sense in a cat talkin' like a man.  Is a cow a
man?--er is a cow a cat?
No, she ain't either of them.
Well, den, she ain't got no business to talk like either one er the
yuther of 'em.  Is a Frenchman a man?
Yes.
_Well_, den!  Dad blame it, why doan' he _talk_ like a man?  You answer
me _dat_!
I see it warn't no use wasting words--you can't learn a nigger to argue.
So I quit.
CHAPTER XV.
WE judged that three nights more would fetch us to Cairo, at the bottom
of Illinois, where the Ohio River comes in, and that was what we was
after.  We would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the
Ohio amongst the free States, and then be out of trouble.
Well, the second night a fog begun to come on, and we made for a towhead
to tie to, for it wouldn't do to try to run in a fog; but when I paddled
ahead in the canoe, with the line to make fast, there warn't anything
but little saplings to tie to.  I passed the line around one of them
right on the edge of the cut bank, but there was a stiff current, and
the raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots and
away she went.  I see the fog closing down, and it made me so sick and
scared I couldn't budge for most a half a minute it seemed to me--and
then there warn't no raft in sight; you couldn't see twenty yards.  I
jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern, and grabbed the paddle
and set her back a stroke.  But she didn't come.  I was in such a hurry
I hadn't untied her.  I got up and tried to untie her, but I was so
excited my hands shook so I couldn't hardly do anything with them.
As soon as I got started I took out after the raft, hot and heavy, right
down the towhead.  That was all right as far as it went, but the towhead
warn't sixty yards long, and the minute I flew by the foot of it I shot
out into the solid white fog, and hadn't no more idea which way I was
going than a dead man.
Thinks I, it won't do to paddle; first I know I'll run into the bank
or a towhead or something; I got to set still and float, and yet it's
mighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such a time.
I whooped and listened.  Away down there somewheres I hears a small
whoop, and up comes my spirits.  I went tearing after it, listening
sharp to hear it again.  The next time it come I see I warn't heading
for it, but heading away to the right of it.  And the next time I was
heading away to the left of it--and not gaining on it much either, for
I was flying around, this way and that and t'other, but it was going
straight ahead all the time.
I did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan, and beat it all the
time, but he never did, and it was the still places between the whoops
that was making the trouble for me.  Well, I fought along, and directly
I hears the whoop _behind_ me.  I was tangled good now.  That was
somebody else's whoop, or else I was turned around.
I throwed the paddle down.  I heard the whoop again; it was behind me
yet, but in a different place; it kept coming, and kept changing its
place, and I kept answering, till by and by it was in front of me again,
and I knowed the current had swung the canoe's head down-stream, and I
was all right if that was Jim and not some other raftsman hollering.
I couldn't tell nothing about voices in a fog, for nothing don't look
natural nor sound natural in a fog.
The whooping went on, and in about a minute I come a-booming down on a
cut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it, and the current throwed
me off to the left and shot by, amongst a lot of snags that fairly
roared, the currrent was tearing by them so swift.
In another second or two it was solid white and still again.  I set
perfectly still then, listening to my heart thump, and I reckon I didn't
draw a breath while it thumped a hundred.
I just give up then.  I knowed what the matter was.  That cut bank
was an island, and Jim had gone down t'other side of it.  It warn't no
towhead that you could float by in ten minutes.  It had the big timber
of a regular island; it might be five or six miles long and more than
half a mile wide.
I kept quiet, with my ears cocked, about fifteen minutes, I reckon.  I
was floating along, of course, four or five miles an hour; but you don't
ever think of that.  No, you _feel_ like you are laying dead still on
the water; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you don't think to
yourself how fast _you're_ going, but you catch your breath and think,
my! how that snag's tearing along.  If you think it ain't dismal and
lonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night, you try it
once--you'll see.
Next, for about a half an hour, I whoops now and then; at last I hears
the answer a long ways off, and tries to follow it, but I couldn't do
it, and directly I judged I'd got into a nest of towheads, for I had
little dim glimpses of them on both sides of me--sometimes just a narrow
channel between, and some that I couldn't see I knowed was there because
I'd hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash
that hung over the banks.  Well, I warn't long loosing the whoops down
amongst the towheads; and I only tried to chase them a little while,
anyway, because it was worse than chasing a Jack-o'-lantern.  You never
knowed a sound dodge around so, and swap places so quick and so much.
I had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times, to
keep from knocking the islands out of the river; and so I judged the
raft must be butting into the bank every now and then, or else it would
get further ahead and clear out of hearing--it was floating a little
faster than what I was.
Well, I seemed to be in the open river again by and by, but I couldn't
hear no sign of a whoop nowheres.  I reckoned Jim had fetched up on a
snag, maybe, and it was all up with him.  I was good and tired, so I
laid down in the canoe and said I wouldn't bother no more.  I didn't
want to go to sleep, of course; but I was so sleepy I couldn't help it;
so I thought I would take jest one little cat-nap.
But I reckon it was more than a cat-nap, for when I waked up the stars
was shining bright, the fog was all gone, and I was spinning down a
big bend stern first.  First I didn't know where I was; I thought I was
dreaming; and when things began to come back to me they seemed to come
up dim out of last week.
It was a monstrous big river here, with the tallest and the thickest
kind of timber on both banks; just a solid wall, as well as I could see
by the stars.  I looked away down-stream, and seen a black speck on the
water. I took after it; but when I got to it it warn't nothing but a
couple of sawlogs made fast together.  Then I see another speck, and
chased that; then another, and this time I was right.  It was the raft.
When I got to it Jim was setting there with his head down between his
knees, asleep, with his right arm hanging over the steering-oar.  The
other oar was smashed off, and the raft was littered up with leaves and
branches and dirt.  So she'd had a rough time.
I made fast and laid down under Jim's nose on the raft, and began to
gap, and stretch my fists out against Jim, and says:
Hello, Jim, have I been asleep?  Why didn't you stir me up?
Goodness gracious, is dat you, Huck?  En you ain' dead--you ain'
drownded--you's back agin?  It's too good for true, honey, it's too good
for true. Lemme look at you chile, lemme feel o' you.  No, you ain'
dead! you's back agin, 'live en soun', jis de same ole Huck--de same ole
Huck, thanks to goodness!
What's the matter with you, Jim?  You been a-drinking?
Drinkin'?  Has I ben a-drinkin'?  Has I had a chance to be a-drinkin'?
Well, then, what makes you talk so wild?
How does I talk wild?
_How_?  Why, hain't you been talking about my coming back, and all that
stuff, as if I'd been gone away?
Huck--Huck Finn, you look me in de eye; look me in de eye.  _Hain't_ you
ben gone away?
Gone away?  Why, what in the nation do you mean?  I hain't been gone
anywheres.  Where would I go to?
Well, looky here, boss, dey's sumf'n wrong, dey is.  Is I _me_, or who
_is_ I? Is I heah, or whah _is_ I?  Now dat's what I wants to know.
Well, I think you're here, plain enough, but I think you're a
tangle-headed old fool, Jim.
I is, is I?  Well, you answer me dis:  Didn't you tote out de line in
de canoe fer to make fas' to de tow-head?
No, I didn't.  What tow-head?  I hain't see no tow-head.
You hain't seen no towhead?  Looky here, didn't de line pull loose en
de raf' go a-hummin' down de river, en leave you en de canoe behine in
de fog?
What fog?
Why, de fog!--de fog dat's been aroun' all night.  En didn't you whoop,
en didn't I whoop, tell we got mix' up in de islands en one un us got
los' en t'other one was jis' as good as los', 'kase he didn' know whah
he wuz? En didn't I bust up agin a lot er dem islands en have a turrible
time en mos' git drownded?  Now ain' dat so, boss--ain't it so?  You
answer me dat.
Well, this is too many for me, Jim.  I hain't seen no fog, nor no
islands, nor no troubles, nor nothing.  I been setting here talking with
you all night till you went to sleep about ten minutes ago, and I reckon
I done the same.  You couldn't a got drunk in that time, so of course
you've been dreaming.
Dad fetch it, how is I gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes?
Well, hang it all, you did dream it, because there didn't any of it
happen.
But, Huck, it's all jis' as plain to me as--
It don't make no difference how plain it is; there ain't nothing in it.
I know, because I've been here all the time.
Jim didn't say nothing for about five minutes, but set there studying
over it.  Then he says:
Well, den, I reck'n I did dream it, Huck; but dog my cats ef it ain't
de powerfullest dream I ever see.  En I hain't ever had no dream b'fo'
dat's tired me like dis one.
Oh, well, that's all right, because a dream does tire a body like
everything sometimes.  But this one was a staving dream; tell me all
about it, Jim.
So Jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through, just as
it happened, only he painted it up considerable.  Then he said he must
start in and 'terpret it, because it was sent for a warning.  He said
the first towhead stood for a man that would try to do us some good, but
the current was another man that would get us away from him.  The whoops
was warnings that would come to us every now and then, and if we didn't
try hard to make out to understand them they'd just take us into bad
luck, 'stead of keeping us out of it.  The lot of towheads was troubles
we was going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kinds of mean
folks, but if we minded our business and didn't talk back and aggravate
them, we would pull through and get out of the fog and into the big
clear river, which was the free States, and wouldn't have no more
trouble.
It had clouded up pretty dark just after I got on to the raft, but it
was clearing up again now.
Oh, well, that's all interpreted well enough as far as it goes, Jim, I
says; but what does _these_ things stand for?
It was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar.  You
could see them first-rate now.
Jim looked at the trash, and then looked at me, and back at the trash
again.  He had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he
couldn't seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its place
again right away.  But when he did get the thing straightened around he
looked at me steady without ever smiling, and says:
What do dey stan' for?  I'se gwyne to tell you.  When I got all wore
out wid work, en wid de callin' for you, en went to sleep, my heart wuz
mos' broke bekase you wuz los', en I didn' k'yer no' mo' what become
er me en de raf'.  En when I wake up en fine you back agin, all safe
en soun', de tears come, en I could a got down on my knees en kiss yo'
foot, I's so thankful. En all you wuz thinkin' 'bout wuz how you could
make a fool uv ole Jim wid a lie.  Dat truck dah is _trash_; en trash
is what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey fren's en makes 'em
ashamed.
Then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam, and went in there without
saying anything but that.  But that was enough.  It made me feel so mean
I could almost kissed _his_ foot to get him to take it back.
It was fifteen minutes before I could work myself up to go and humble
myself to a nigger; but I done it, and I warn't ever sorry for it
afterwards, neither.  I didn't do him no more mean tricks, and I
wouldn't done that one if I'd a knowed it would make him feel that way.
CHAPTER XVI.
WE slept most all day, and started out at night, a little ways behind a
monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession.  She had
four long sweeps at each end, so we judged she carried as many as thirty
men, likely.  She had five big wigwams aboard, wide apart, and an open
camp fire in the middle, and a tall flag-pole at each end.  There was a
power of style about her.  It _amounted_ to something being a raftsman
on such a craft as that.
We went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded up and got
hot.  The river was very wide, and was walled with solid timber on
both sides; you couldn't see a break in it hardly ever, or a light.  We
talked about Cairo, and wondered whether we would know it when we got to
it.  I said likely we wouldn't, because I had heard say there warn't but
about a dozen houses there, and if they didn't happen to have them lit
up, how was we going to know we was passing a town?  Jim said if the two
big rivers joined together there, that would show.  But I said maybe
we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the
same old river again. That disturbed Jim--and me too.  So the question
was, what to do?  I said, paddle ashore the first time a light showed,
and tell them pap was behind, coming along with a trading-scow, and
was a green hand at the business, and wanted to know how far it was to
Cairo.  Jim thought it was a good idea, so we took a smoke on it and
waited.
There warn't nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town, and
not pass it without seeing it.  He said he'd be mighty sure to see it,
because he'd be a free man the minute he seen it, but if he missed it
he'd be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom.  Every
little while he jumps up and says:
Dah she is?
But it warn't.  It was Jack-o'-lanterns, or lightning bugs; so he set
down again, and went to watching, same as before.  Jim said it made him
all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom.  Well, I can
tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him,
because I begun to get it through my head that he _was_ most free--and
who was to blame for it?  Why, _me_.  I couldn't get that out of my
conscience, no how nor no way. It got to troubling me so I couldn't
rest; I couldn't stay still in one place.  It hadn't ever come home to
me before, what this thing was that I was doing.  But now it did; and it
stayed with me, and scorched me more and more.  I tried to make out to
myself that I warn't to blame, because I didn't run Jim off from his
rightful owner; but it warn't no use, conscience up and says, every
time, But you knowed he was running for his freedom, and you could a
paddled ashore and told somebody.  That was so--I couldn't get around
that noway.  That was where it pinched.  Conscience says to me, What
had poor Miss Watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off
right under your eyes and never say one single word?  What did that poor
old woman do to you that you could treat her so mean?  Why, she tried to
learn you your book, she tried to learn you your manners, she tried to
be good to you every way she knowed how.  _That's_ what she done.
I got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead.  I
fidgeted up and down the raft, abusing myself to myself, and Jim was
fidgeting up and down past me.  We neither of us could keep still.
Every time he danced around and says, Dah's Cairo! it went through me
like a shot, and I thought if it _was_ Cairo I reckoned I would die of
miserableness.
Jim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself.  He was
saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free State he
would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent, and when he
got enough he would buy his wife, which was owned on a farm close to
where Miss Watson lived; and then they would both work to buy the
two children, and if their master wouldn't sell them, they'd get an
Ab'litionist to go and steal them.
It most froze me to hear such talk.  He wouldn't ever dared to talk such
talk in his life before.  Just see what a difference it made in him the
minute he judged he was about free.  It was according to the old saying,
Give a nigger an inch and he'll take an ell.  Thinks I, this is what
comes of my not thinking.  Here was this nigger, which I had as good
as helped to run away, coming right out flat-footed and saying he would
steal his children--children that belonged to a man I didn't even know; a
man that hadn't ever done me no harm.
I was sorry to hear Jim say that, it was such a lowering of him.  My
conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever, until at last I says
to it, Let up on me--it ain't too late yet--I'll paddle ashore at the
first light and tell.  I felt easy and happy and light as a feather
right off.  All my troubles was gone.  I went to looking out sharp for a
light, and sort of singing to myself.  By and by one showed.  Jim sings
out:
We's safe, Huck, we's safe!  Jump up and crack yo' heels!  Dat's de
good ole Cairo at las', I jis knows it!
I says:
I'll take the canoe and go and see, Jim.  It mightn't be, you know.
He jumped and got the canoe ready, and put his old coat in the bottom
for me to set on, and give me the paddle; and as I shoved off, he says:
Pooty soon I'll be a-shout'n' for joy, en I'll say, it's all on
accounts o' Huck; I's a free man, en I couldn't ever ben free ef it
hadn' ben for Huck; Huck done it.  Jim won't ever forgit you, Huck;
you's de bes' fren' Jim's ever had; en you's de _only_ fren' ole Jim's
got now.
I was paddling off, all in a sweat to tell on him; but when he says
this, it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me.  I went along
slow then, and I warn't right down certain whether I was glad I started
or whether I warn't.  When I was fifty yards off, Jim says:
Dah you goes, de ole true Huck; de on'y white genlman dat ever kep' his
promise to ole Jim.
Well, I just felt sick.  But I says, I _got_ to do it--I can't get _out_
of it.  Right then along comes a skiff with two men in it with guns, and
they stopped and I stopped.  One of them says:
What's that yonder?
A piece of a raft, I says.
Do you belong on it?
Yes, sir.
Any men on it?
Only one, sir.
Well, there's five niggers run off to-night up yonder, above the head
of the bend.  Is your man white or black?
I didn't answer up prompt.  I tried to, but the words wouldn't come. I
tried for a second or two to brace up and out with it, but I warn't man
enough--hadn't the spunk of a rabbit.  I see I was weakening; so I just
give up trying, and up and says:
He's white.
I reckon we'll go and see for ourselves.
I wish you would, says I, because it's pap that's there, and maybe
you'd help me tow the raft ashore where the light is.  He's sick--and so
is mam and Mary Ann.
Oh, the devil! we're in a hurry, boy.  But I s'pose we've got to.
Come, buckle to your paddle, and let's get along.
I buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars.  When we had made a
stroke or two, I says:
Pap'll be mighty much obleeged to you, I can tell you.  Everybody goes
away when I want them to help me tow the raft ashore, and I can't do it
by myself.
Well, that's infernal mean.  Odd, too.  Say, boy, what's the matter
with your father?
It's the--a--the--well, it ain't anything much.
They stopped pulling.  It warn't but a mighty little ways to the raft
now. One says:
Boy, that's a lie.  What _is_ the matter with your pap?  Answer up
square now, and it'll be the better for you.
I will, sir, I will, honest--but don't leave us, please.  It's
the--the--Gentlemen, if you'll only pull ahead, and let me heave you the
headline, you won't have to come a-near the raft--please do.
Set her back, John, set her back! says one.  They backed water.  Keep
away, boy--keep to looard.  Confound it, I just expect the wind has
blowed it to us.  Your pap's got the small-pox, and you know it precious
well.  Why didn't you come out and say so?  Do you want to spread it all
over?
Well, says I, a-blubbering, I've told everybody before, and they just
went away and left us.
Poor devil, there's something in that.  We are right down sorry for
you, but we--well, hang it, we don't want the small-pox, you see.  Look
here, I'll tell you what to do.  Don't you try to land by yourself, or
you'll smash everything to pieces.  You float along down about twenty
miles, and you'll come to a town on the left-hand side of the river.  It
will be long after sun-up then, and when you ask for help you tell them
your folks are all down with chills and fever.  Don't be a fool again,
and let people guess what is the matter.  Now we're trying to do you a
kindness; so you just put twenty miles between us, that's a good boy.
It wouldn't do any good to land yonder where the light is--it's only a
wood-yard. Say, I reckon your father's poor, and I'm bound to say he's
in pretty hard luck.  Here, I'll put a twenty-dollar gold piece on this
board, and you get it when it floats by.  I feel mighty mean to leave
you; but my kingdom! it won't do to fool with small-pox, don't you see?
Hold on, Parker, says the other man, here's a twenty to put on the
board for me.  Good-bye, boy; you do as Mr. Parker told you, and you'll
be all right.
That's so, my boy--good-bye, good-bye.  If you see any runaway niggers
you get help and nab them, and you can make some money by it.
Good-bye, sir, says I; I won't let no runaway niggers get by me if I
can help it.
They went off and I got aboard the raft, feeling bad and low, because I
knowed very well I had done wrong, and I see it warn't no use for me
to try to learn to do right; a body that don't get _started_ right when
he's little ain't got no show--when the pinch comes there ain't nothing
to back him up and keep him to his work, and so he gets beat.  Then I
thought a minute, and says to myself, hold on; s'pose you'd a done right
and give Jim up, would you felt better than what you do now?  No, says
I, I'd feel bad--I'd feel just the same way I do now.  Well, then, says
I, what's the use you learning to do right when it's troublesome to do
right and ain't no trouble to do wrong, and the wages is just the same?
I was stuck.  I couldn't answer that.  So I reckoned I wouldn't bother
no more about it, but after this always do whichever come handiest at
the time.
I went into the wigwam; Jim warn't there.  I looked all around; he
warn't anywhere.  I says:
Jim!
Here I is, Huck.  Is dey out o' sight yit?  Don't talk loud.
He was in the river under the stern oar, with just his nose out.  I told
him they were out of sight, so he come aboard.  He says:
I was a-listenin' to all de talk, en I slips into de river en was gwyne
to shove for sho' if dey come aboard.  Den I was gwyne to swim to de
raf' agin when dey was gone.  But lawsy, how you did fool 'em, Huck!
Dat _wuz_ de smartes' dodge!  I tell you, chile, I'spec it save' ole
Jim--ole Jim ain't going to forgit you for dat, honey.
Then we talked about the money.  It was a pretty good raise--twenty
dollars apiece.  Jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat
now, and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free
States. He said twenty mile more warn't far for the raft to go, but he
wished we was already there.
Towards daybreak we tied up, and Jim was mighty particular about hiding
the raft good.  Then he worked all day fixing things in bundles, and
getting all ready to quit rafting.
That night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down
in a left-hand bend.
I went off in the canoe to ask about it.  Pretty soon I found a man out
in the river with a skiff, setting a trot-line.  I ranged up and says:
Mister, is that town Cairo?
Cairo? no.  You must be a blame' fool.
What town is it, mister?
If you want to know, go and find out.  If you stay here botherin'
around me for about a half a minute longer you'll get something you
won't want.
I paddled to the raft.  Jim was awful disappointed, but I said never
mind, Cairo would be the next place, I reckoned.
We passed another town before daylight, and I was going out again; but
it was high ground, so I didn't go.  No high ground about Cairo, Jim
said. I had forgot it.  We laid up for the day on a towhead tolerable
close to the left-hand bank.  I begun to suspicion something.  So did
Jim.  I says:
Maybe we went by Cairo in the fog that night.
He says:
Doan' le's talk about it, Huck.  Po' niggers can't have no luck.  I
awluz 'spected dat rattlesnake-skin warn't done wid its work.
I wish I'd never seen that snake-skin, Jim--I do wish I'd never laid
eyes on it.
It ain't yo' fault, Huck; you didn' know.  Don't you blame yo'self
'bout it.
When it was daylight, here was the clear Ohio water inshore, sure
enough, and outside was the old regular Muddy!  So it was all up with
Cairo.
We talked it all over.  It wouldn't do to take to the shore; we couldn't
take the raft up the stream, of course.  There warn't no way but to wait
for dark, and start back in the canoe and take the chances.  So we slept
all day amongst the cottonwood thicket, so as to be fresh for the work,
and when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone!
We didn't say a word for a good while.  There warn't anything to
say.  We both knowed well enough it was some more work of the
rattlesnake-skin; so what was the use to talk about it?  It would only
look like we was finding fault, and that would be bound to fetch more
bad luck--and keep on fetching it, too, till we knowed enough to keep
still.
By and by we talked about what we better do, and found there warn't no
way but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy
a canoe to go back in.  We warn't going to borrow it when there warn't
anybody around, the way pap would do, for that might set people after
us.
So we shoved out after dark on the raft.
Anybody that don't believe yet that it's foolishness to handle a
snake-skin, after all that that snake-skin done for us, will believe it
now if they read on and see what more it done for us.
The place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore.  But we
didn't see no rafts laying up; so we went along during three hours and
more.  Well, the night got gray and ruther thick, which is the next
meanest thing to fog.  You can't tell the shape of the river, and you
can't see no distance. It got to be very late and still, and then along
comes a steamboat up the river.  We lit the lantern, and judged she
would see it.  Up-stream boats didn't generly come close to us; they
go out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs; but
nights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river.
We could hear her pounding along, but we didn't see her good till she
was close.  She aimed right for us.  Often they do that and try to see
how close they can come without touching; sometimes the wheel bites off
a sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs, and thinks
he's mighty smart.  Well, here she comes, and we said she was going to
try and shave us; but she didn't seem to be sheering off a bit.  She
was a big one, and she was coming in a hurry, too, looking like a black
cloud with rows of glow-worms around it; but all of a sudden she bulged
out, big and scary, with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shining
like red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right
over us.  There was a yell at us, and a jingling of bells to stop the
engines, a powwow of cussing, and whistling of steam--and as Jim went
overboard on one side and I on the other, she come smashing straight
through the raft.
I dived--and I aimed to find the bottom, too, for a thirty-foot wheel
had got to go over me, and I wanted it to have plenty of room.  I could
always stay under water a minute; this time I reckon I stayed under a
minute and a half.  Then I bounced for the top in a hurry, for I was
nearly busting.  I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of
my nose, and puffed a bit.  Of course there was a booming current; and
of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she
stopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she was
churning along up the river, out of sight in the thick weather, though I
could hear her.
I sung out for Jim about a dozen times, but I didn't get any answer;
so I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was treading water, and
struck out for shore, shoving it ahead of me.  But I made out to see
that the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore, which
meant that I was in a crossing; so I changed off and went that way.
It was one of these long, slanting, two-mile crossings; so I was a good
long time in getting over.  I made a safe landing, and clumb up the
bank. I couldn't see but a little ways, but I went poking along over
rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more, and then I run across a
big old-fashioned double log-house before I noticed it.  I was going to
rush by and get away, but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling
and barking at me, and I knowed better than to move another peg.
CHAPTER XVII.
IN about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting his
head out, and says:
Be done, boys!  Who's there?
I says:
It's me.
Who's me?
George Jackson, sir.
What do you want?
I don't want nothing, sir.  I only want to go along by, but the dogs
won't let me.
What are you prowling around here this time of night for--hey?
I warn't prowling around, sir, I fell overboard off of the steamboat.
Oh, you did, did you?  Strike a light there, somebody.  What did you
say your name was?
George Jackson, sir.  I'm only a boy.
Look here, if you're telling the truth you needn't be afraid--nobody'll
hurt you.  But don't try to budge; stand right where you are.  Rouse out
Bob and Tom, some of you, and fetch the guns.  George Jackson, is there
anybody with you?
No, sir, nobody.
I heard the people stirring around in the house now, and see a light.
The man sung out:
Snatch that light away, Betsy, you old fool--ain't you got any sense?
Put it on the floor behind the front door.  Bob, if you and Tom are
ready, take your places.
All ready.
Now, George Jackson, do you know the Shepherdsons?
No, sir; I never heard of them.
Well, that may be so, and it mayn't.  Now, all ready.  Step forward,
George Jackson.  And mind, don't you hurry--come mighty slow.  If there's
anybody with you, let him keep back--if he shows himself he'll be shot.
Come along now.  Come slow; push the door open yourself--just enough to
squeeze in, d' you hear?
I didn't hurry; I couldn't if I'd a wanted to.  I took one slow step at
a time and there warn't a sound, only I thought I could hear my heart.
The dogs were as still as the humans, but they followed a little behind
me. When I got to the three log doorsteps I heard them unlocking and
unbarring and unbolting.  I put my hand on the door and pushed it a
little and a little more till somebody said, There, that's enough--put
your head in. I done it, but I judged they would take it off.
The candle was on the floor, and there they all was, looking at me, and
me at them, for about a quarter of a minute:  Three big men with guns
pointed at me, which made me wince, I tell you; the oldest, gray
and about sixty, the other two thirty or more--all of them fine and
handsome--and the sweetest old gray-headed lady, and back of her two
young women which I couldn't see right well.  The old gentleman says:
There; I reckon it's all right.  Come in.
As soon as I was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it
and bolted it, and told the young men to come in with their guns, and
they all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor,
and got together in a corner that was out of the range of the front
windows--there warn't none on the side.  They held the candle, and took a
good look at me, and all said, Why, _he_ ain't a Shepherdson--no, there
ain't any Shepherdson about him.  Then the old man said he hoped I
wouldn't mind being searched for arms, because he didn't mean no harm by
it--it was only to make sure.  So he didn't pry into my pockets, but only
felt outside with his hands, and said it was all right.  He told me to
make myself easy and at home, and tell all about myself; but the old
lady says:
Why, bless you, Saul, the poor thing's as wet as he can be; and don't
you reckon it may be he's hungry?
True for you, Rachel--I forgot.
So the old lady says:
Betsy (this was a nigger woman), you fly around and get him something
to eat as quick as you can, poor thing; and one of you girls go and wake
up Buck and tell him--oh, here he is himself.  Buck, take this little
stranger and get the wet clothes off from him and dress him up in some
of yours that's dry.
Buck looked about as old as me--thirteen or fourteen or along there,
though he was a little bigger than me.  He hadn't on anything but a
shirt, and he was very frowzy-headed.  He came in gaping and digging one
fist into his eyes, and he was dragging a gun along with the other one.
He says:
Ain't they no Shepherdsons around?
They said, no, 'twas a false alarm.
Well, he says, if they'd a ben some, I reckon I'd a got one.
They all laughed, and Bob says:
Why, Buck, they might have scalped us all, you've been so slow in
coming.
Well, nobody come after me, and it ain't right I'm always kept down; I
don't get no show.
Never mind, Buck, my boy, says the old man, you'll have show enough,
all in good time, don't you fret about that.  Go 'long with you now, and
do as your mother told you.
When we got up-stairs to his room he got me a coarse shirt and a
roundabout and pants of his, and I put them on.  While I was at it he
asked me what my name was, but before I could tell him he started to
tell me about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had catched in the woods
day before yesterday, and he asked me where Moses was when the candle
went out.  I said I didn't know; I hadn't heard about it before, no way.
Well, guess, he says.
How'm I going to guess, says I, when I never heard tell of it
before?
But you can guess, can't you?  It's just as easy.
_Which_ candle?  I says.
Why, any candle, he says.
I don't know where he was, says I; where was he?
Why, he was in the _dark_!  That's where he was!
Well, if you knowed where he was, what did you ask me for?
Why, blame it, it's a riddle, don't you see?  Say, how long are you
going to stay here?  You got to stay always.  We can just have booming
times--they don't have no school now.  Do you own a dog?  I've got a
dog--and he'll go in the river and bring out chips that you throw in.  Do
you like to comb up Sundays, and all that kind of foolishness?  You bet
I don't, but ma she makes me.  Confound these ole britches!  I reckon
I'd better put 'em on, but I'd ruther not, it's so warm.  Are you all
ready? All right.  Come along, old hoss.
Cold corn-pone, cold corn-beef, butter and buttermilk--that is what they
had for me down there, and there ain't nothing better that ever I've
come across yet.  Buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes,
except the nigger woman, which was gone, and the two young women.  They
all smoked and talked, and I eat and talked.  The young women had
quilts around them, and their hair down their backs.  They all asked me
questions, and I told them how pap and me and all the family was living
on a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw, and my sister Mary Ann
run off and got married and never was heard of no more, and Bill went
to hunt them and he warn't heard of no more, and Tom and Mort died,
and then there warn't nobody but just me and pap left, and he was just
trimmed down to nothing, on account of his troubles; so when he died
I took what there was left, because the farm didn't belong to us, and
started up the river, deck passage, and fell overboard; and that was how
I come to be here.  So they said I could have a home there as long as I
wanted it.  Then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed, and I
went to bed with Buck, and when I waked up in the morning, drat it all,
I had forgot what my name was. So I laid there about an hour trying to
think, and when Buck waked up I says:
Can you spell, Buck?
Yes, he says.
I bet you can't spell my name, says I.
I bet you what you dare I can, says he.
All right, says I, go ahead.
G-e-o-r-g-e J-a-x-o-n--there now, he says.
Well, says I, you done it, but I didn't think you could.  It ain't no
slouch of a name to spell--right off without studying.
I set it down, private, because somebody might want _me_ to spell it
next, and so I wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like I was
used to it.
It was a mighty nice family, and a mighty nice house, too.  I hadn't
seen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much
style.  It didn't have an iron latch on the front door, nor a wooden one
with a buckskin string, but a brass knob to turn, the same as houses in
town. There warn't no bed in the parlor, nor a sign of a bed; but heaps
of parlors in towns has beds in them.  There was a big fireplace that
was bricked on the bottom, and the bricks was kept clean and red by
pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick; sometimes
they wash them over with red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown,
same as they do in town.  They had big brass dog-irons that could hold
up a saw-log. There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece, with
a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front, and
a round place in the middle of it for the sun, and you could see the
pendulum swinging behind it.  It was beautiful to hear that clock tick;
and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her
up and got her in good shape, she would start in and strike a hundred
and fifty before she got tuckered out.  They wouldn't took any money for
her.
Well, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock,
made out of something like chalk, and painted up gaudy.  By one of the
parrots was a cat made of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other;
and when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn't open
their mouths nor look different nor interested.  They squeaked through
underneath.  There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out
behind those things.  On the table in the middle of the room was a kind
of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and
grapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and prettier
than real ones is, but they warn't real because you could see where
pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk, or whatever it
was, underneath.
This table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth, with a red and
blue spread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all around.  It
come all the way from Philadelphia, they said.  There was some books,
too, piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of the table.  One was a
big family Bible full of pictures.  One was Pilgrim's Progress, about a
man that left his family, it didn't say why.  I read considerable in it
now and then.  The statements was interesting, but tough.  Another was
Friendship's Offering, full of beautiful stuff and poetry; but I didn't
read the poetry.  Another was Henry Clay's Speeches, and another was Dr.
Gunn's Family Medicine, which told you all about what to do if a body
was sick or dead.  There was a hymn book, and a lot of other books.  And
there was nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound, too--not bagged
down in the middle and busted, like an old basket.
They had pictures hung on the walls--mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes,
and battles, and Highland Marys, and one called Signing the
Declaration. There was some that they called crayons, which one of the
daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only
fifteen years old.  They was different from any pictures I ever see
before--blacker, mostly, than is common.  One was a woman in a slim black
dress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in
the middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with
a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and
very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a
tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand
hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule,
and underneath the picture it said Shall I Never See Thee More Alas.
Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight
to the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb like a
chair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird
laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and underneath
the picture it said I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas.
There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the
moon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open letter in
one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she was
mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and underneath
the picture it said And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas.  These
was all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn't somehow seem to take
to them, because if ever I was down a little they always give me the
fan-tods.  Everybody was sorry she died, because she had laid out a lot
more of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what she had done
what they had lost.  But I reckoned that with her disposition she was
having a better time in the graveyard.  She was at work on what they
said was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day and
every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it
done, but she never got the chance.  It was a picture of a young woman
in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump
off, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon, with
the tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded across her
breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching up
towards the moon--and the idea was to see which pair would look best,
and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was saying, she died
before she got her mind made up, and now they kept this picture over the
head of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday come they hung
flowers on it.  Other times it was hid with a little curtain.  The young
woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so
many arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to me.
This young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive, and used to paste
obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the
Presbyterian Observer, and write poetry after them out of her own head.
It was very good poetry. This is what she wrote about a boy by the name
of Stephen Dowling Bots that fell down a well and was drownded:
ODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS, DEC'D
And did young Stephen sicken,    And did young Stephen die? And did the
sad hearts thicken,    And did the mourners cry?
No; such was not the fate of    Young Stephen Dowling Bots; Though sad
hearts round him thickened,    'Twas not from sickness' shots.
No whooping-cough did rack his frame,    Nor measles drear with spots;
Not these impaired the sacred name    Of Stephen Dowling Bots.
Despised love struck not with woe    That head of curly knots, Nor
stomach troubles laid him low,    Young Stephen Dowling Bots.
O no. Then list with tearful eye,    Whilst I his fate do tell. His soul
did from this cold world fly    By falling down a well.
They got him out and emptied him;    Alas it was too late; His spirit
was gone for to sport aloft    In the realms of the good and great.
If Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she was
fourteen, there ain't no telling what she could a done by and by.  Buck
said she could rattle off poetry like nothing.  She didn't ever have to
stop to think.  He said she would slap down a line, and if she couldn't
find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down
another one, and go ahead. She warn't particular; she could write about
anything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful.
Every time a man died, or a woman died, or a child died, she would be on
hand with her tribute before he was cold.  She called them tributes.
The neighbors said it was the doctor first, then Emmeline, then the
undertaker--the undertaker never got in ahead of Emmeline but once, and
then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person's name, which was
Whistler.  She warn't ever the same after that; she never complained,
but she kinder pined away and did not live long.  Poor thing, many's the
time I made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get
out her poor old scrap-book and read in it when her pictures had been
aggravating me and I had soured on her a little.  I liked all that
family, dead ones and all, and warn't going to let anything come between
us.  Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was
alive, and it didn't seem right that there warn't nobody to make some
about her now she was gone; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two
myself, but I couldn't seem to make it go somehow.  They kept Emmeline's
room trim and nice, and all the things fixed in it just the way she
liked to have them when she was alive, and nobody ever slept there.
The old lady took care of the room herself, though there was plenty
of niggers, and she sewed there a good deal and read her Bible there
mostly.
Well, as I was saying about the parlor, there was beautiful curtains on
the windows:  white, with pictures painted on them of castles with vines
all down the walls, and cattle coming down to drink.  There was a little
old piano, too, that had tin pans in it, I reckon, and nothing was ever
so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing The Last Link is Broken
and play The Battle of Prague on it.  The walls of all the rooms was
plastered, and most had carpets on the floors, and the whole house was
whitewashed on the outside.
It was a double house, and the big open place betwixt them was roofed
and floored, and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the
day, and it was a cool, comfortable place.  Nothing couldn't be better.
And warn't the cooking good, and just bushels of it too!
CHAPTER XVIII.
COL.  Grangerford was a gentleman, you see.  He was a gentleman all
over; and so was his family.  He was well born, as the saying is, and
that's worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas
said, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy
in our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn't no more
quality than a mudcat himself.  Col.  Grangerford was very tall and
very slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it
anywheres; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face, and
he had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and
a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so
deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at
you, as you may say.  His forehead was high, and his hair was black and
straight and hung to his shoulders. His hands was long and thin, and
every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head
to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it;
and on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it.  He
carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it.  There warn't no
frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn't ever loud.  He was
as kind as he could be--you could feel that, you know, and so you had
confidence.  Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he
straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to
flicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first,
and find out what the matter was afterwards.  He didn't ever have to
tell anybody to mind their manners--everybody was always good-mannered
where he was.  Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine
most always--I mean he made it seem like good weather.  When he turned
into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute, and that was
enough; there wouldn't nothing go wrong again for a week.
When him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got
up out of their chairs and give them good-day, and didn't set down again
till they had set down.  Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard where
the decanter was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him, and
he held it in his hand and waited till Tom's and Bob's was mixed, and
then they bowed and said, Our duty to you, sir, and madam; and _they_
bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you, and so they drank,
all three, and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and
the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers, and
give it to me and Buck, and we drank to the old people too.
Bob was the oldest and Tom next--tall, beautiful men with very broad
shoulders and brown faces, and long black hair and black eyes.  They
dressed in white linen from head to foot, like the old gentleman, and
wore broad Panama hats.
Then there was Miss Charlotte; she was twenty-five, and tall and proud
and grand, but as good as she could be when she warn't stirred up; but
when she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks,
like her father.  She was beautiful.
So was her sister, Miss Sophia, but it was a different kind.  She was
gentle and sweet like a dove, and she was only twenty.
Each person had their own nigger to wait on them--Buck too.  My nigger
had a monstrous easy time, because I warn't used to having anybody do
anything for me, but Buck's was on the jump most of the time.
This was all there was of the family now, but there used to be
more--three sons; they got killed; and Emmeline that died.
The old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers.
Sometimes a stack of people would come there, horseback, from ten or
fifteen mile around, and stay five or six days, and have such junketings
round about and on the river, and dances and picnics in the woods
daytimes, and balls at the house nights.  These people was mostly
kinfolks of the family.  The men brought their guns with them.  It was a
handsome lot of quality, I tell you.
There was another clan of aristocracy around there--five or six
families--mostly of the name of Shepherdson.  They was as high-toned
and well born and rich and grand as the tribe of Grangerfords.  The
Shepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same steamboat landing, which was
about two mile above our house; so sometimes when I went up there with a
lot of our folks I used to see a lot of the Shepherdsons there on their
fine horses.
One day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting, and heard a horse
coming.  We was crossing the road.  Buck says:
Quick!  Jump for the woods!
We done it, and then peeped down the woods through the leaves.  Pretty
soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road, setting his
horse easy and looking like a soldier.  He had his gun across his
pommel.  I had seen him before.  It was young Harney Shepherdson.  I
heard Buck's gun go off at my ear, and Harney's hat tumbled off from his
head.  He grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was
hid.  But we didn't wait.  We started through the woods on a run.  The
woods warn't thick, so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet,
and twice I seen Harney cover Buck with his gun; and then he rode away
the way he come--to get his hat, I reckon, but I couldn't see.  We never
stopped running till we got home.  The old gentleman's eyes blazed a
minute--'twas pleasure, mainly, I judged--then his face sort of smoothed
down, and he says, kind of gentle:
I don't like that shooting from behind a bush.  Why didn't you step
into the road, my boy?
The Shepherdsons don't, father.  They always take advantage.
Miss Charlotte she held her head up like a queen while Buck was telling
his tale, and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped.  The two young
men looked dark, but never said nothing.  Miss Sophia she turned pale,
but the color come back when she found the man warn't hurt.
Soon as I could get Buck down by the corn-cribs under the trees by
ourselves, I says:
Did you want to kill him, Buck?
Well, I bet I did.
What did he do to you?
Him?  He never done nothing to me.
Well, then, what did you want to kill him for?
Why, nothing--only it's on account of the feud.
What's a feud?
Why, where was you raised?  Don't you know what a feud is?
Never heard of it before--tell me about it.
Well, says Buck, a feud is this way:  A man has a quarrel with
another man, and kills him; then that other man's brother kills _him_;
then the other brothers, on both sides, goes for one another; then the
_cousins_ chip in--and by and by everybody's killed off, and there ain't
no more feud.  But it's kind of slow, and takes a long time.
Has this one been going on long, Buck?
Well, I should _reckon_!  It started thirty year ago, or som'ers along
there.  There was trouble 'bout something, and then a lawsuit to settle
it; and the suit went agin one of the men, and so he up and shot the
man that won the suit--which he would naturally do, of course.  Anybody
would.
What was the trouble about, Buck?--land?
I reckon maybe--I don't know.
Well, who done the shooting?  Was it a Grangerford or a Shepherdson?
Laws, how do I know?  It was so long ago.
Don't anybody know?
Oh, yes, pa knows, I reckon, and some of the other old people; but they
don't know now what the row was about in the first place.
Has there been many killed, Buck?
Yes; right smart chance of funerals.  But they don't always kill.  Pa's
got a few buckshot in him; but he don't mind it 'cuz he don't weigh
much, anyway.  Bob's been carved up some with a bowie, and Tom's been
hurt once or twice.
Has anybody been killed this year, Buck?
Yes; we got one and they got one.  'Bout three months ago my cousin
Bud, fourteen year old, was riding through the woods on t'other side
of the river, and didn't have no weapon with him, which was blame'
foolishness, and in a lonesome place he hears a horse a-coming behind
him, and sees old Baldy Shepherdson a-linkin' after him with his gun in
his hand and his white hair a-flying in the wind; and 'stead of jumping
off and taking to the brush, Bud 'lowed he could out-run him; so they
had it, nip and tuck, for five mile or more, the old man a-gaining all
the time; so at last Bud seen it warn't any use, so he stopped and faced
around so as to have the bullet holes in front, you know, and the old
man he rode up and shot him down.  But he didn't git much chance to
enjoy his luck, for inside of a week our folks laid _him_ out.
I reckon that old man was a coward, Buck.
I reckon he _warn't_ a coward.  Not by a blame' sight.  There ain't a
coward amongst them Shepherdsons--not a one.  And there ain't no cowards
amongst the Grangerfords either.  Why, that old man kep' up his end in a
fight one day for half an hour against three Grangerfords, and come
out winner.  They was all a-horseback; he lit off of his horse and got
behind a little woodpile, and kep' his horse before him to stop the
bullets; but the Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around
the old man, and peppered away at him, and he peppered away at them.
Him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled, but the
Grangerfords had to be _fetched_ home--and one of 'em was dead, and
another died the next day.  No, sir; if a body's out hunting for cowards
he don't want to fool away any time amongst them Shepherdsons, becuz
they don't breed any of that _kind_.
Next Sunday we all went to church, about three mile, everybody
a-horseback. The men took their guns along, so did Buck, and kept
them between their knees or stood them handy against the wall.  The
Shepherdsons done the same.  It was pretty ornery preaching--all about
brotherly love, and such-like tiresomeness; but everybody said it was
a good sermon, and they all talked it over going home, and had such
a powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and
preforeordestination, and I don't know what all, that it did seem to me
to be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yet.
About an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around, some in their
chairs and some in their rooms, and it got to be pretty dull.  Buck and
a dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep.  I went up
to our room, and judged I would take a nap myself.  I found that sweet
Miss Sophia standing in her door, which was next to ours, and she took
me in her room and shut the door very soft, and asked me if I liked her,
and I said I did; and she asked me if I would do something for her and
not tell anybody, and I said I would.  Then she said she'd forgot her
Testament, and left it in the seat at church between two other books,
and would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her, and not say
nothing to nobody.  I said I would. So I slid out and slipped off up the
road, and there warn't anybody at the church, except maybe a hog or two,
for there warn't any lock on the door, and hogs likes a puncheon floor
in summer-time because it's cool.  If you notice, most folks don't go to
church only when they've got to; but a hog is different.
Says I to myself, something's up; it ain't natural for a girl to be in
such a sweat about a Testament.  So I give it a shake, and out drops a
little piece of paper with HALF-PAST TWO wrote on it with a pencil.  I
ransacked it, but couldn't find anything else.  I couldn't make anything
out of that, so I put the paper in the book again, and when I got home
and upstairs there was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me.  She
pulled me in and shut the door; then she looked in the Testament till
she found the paper, and as soon as she read it she looked glad; and
before a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze, and
said I was the best boy in the world, and not to tell anybody.  She was
mighty red in the face for a minute, and her eyes lighted up, and it
made her powerful pretty.  I was a good deal astonished, but when I got
my breath I asked her what the paper was about, and she asked me if I
had read it, and I said no, and she asked me if I could read writing,
and I told her no, only coarse-hand, and then she said the paper
warn't anything but a book-mark to keep her place, and I might go and
play now.
I went off down to the river, studying over this thing, and pretty soon
I noticed that my nigger was following along behind.  When we was out
of sight of the house he looked back and around a second, and then comes
a-running, and says:
Mars Jawge, if you'll come down into de swamp I'll show you a whole
stack o' water-moccasins.
Thinks I, that's mighty curious; he said that yesterday.  He oughter
know a body don't love water-moccasins enough to go around hunting for
them. What is he up to, anyway?  So I says:
All right; trot ahead.
I followed a half a mile; then he struck out over the swamp, and waded
ankle deep as much as another half-mile.  We come to a little flat piece
of land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines,
and he says:
You shove right in dah jist a few steps, Mars Jawge; dah's whah dey is.
I's seed 'm befo'; I don't k'yer to see 'em no mo'.
Then he slopped right along and went away, and pretty soon the trees hid
him.  I poked into the place a-ways and come to a little open patch
as big as a bedroom all hung around with vines, and found a man laying
there asleep--and, by jings, it was my old Jim!
I waked him up, and I reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to
him to see me again, but it warn't.  He nearly cried he was so glad, but
he warn't surprised.  Said he swum along behind me that night, and heard
me yell every time, but dasn't answer, because he didn't want nobody to
pick _him_ up and take him into slavery again.  Says he:
I got hurt a little, en couldn't swim fas', so I wuz a considable ways
behine you towards de las'; when you landed I reck'ned I could ketch
up wid you on de lan' 'dout havin' to shout at you, but when I see dat
house I begin to go slow.  I 'uz off too fur to hear what dey say to
you--I wuz 'fraid o' de dogs; but when it 'uz all quiet agin I knowed
you's in de house, so I struck out for de woods to wait for day.  Early
in de mawnin' some er de niggers come along, gwyne to de fields, en dey
tuk me en showed me dis place, whah de dogs can't track me on accounts
o' de water, en dey brings me truck to eat every night, en tells me how
you's a-gitt'n along.
Why didn't you tell my Jack to fetch me here sooner, Jim?
Well, 'twarn't no use to 'sturb you, Huck, tell we could do sumfn--but
we's all right now.  I ben a-buyin' pots en pans en vittles, as I got a
chanst, en a-patchin' up de raf' nights when--
_What_ raft, Jim?
Our ole raf'.
You mean to say our old raft warn't smashed all to flinders?
No, she warn't.  She was tore up a good deal--one en' of her was; but
dey warn't no great harm done, on'y our traps was mos' all los'.  Ef we
hadn' dive' so deep en swum so fur under water, en de night hadn' ben
so dark, en we warn't so sk'yerd, en ben sich punkin-heads, as de sayin'
is, we'd a seed de raf'.  But it's jis' as well we didn't, 'kase now
she's all fixed up agin mos' as good as new, en we's got a new lot o'
stuff, in de place o' what 'uz los'.
Why, how did you get hold of the raft again, Jim--did you catch her?
How I gwyne to ketch her en I out in de woods?  No; some er de niggers
foun' her ketched on a snag along heah in de ben', en dey hid her in a
crick 'mongst de willows, en dey wuz so much jawin' 'bout which un 'um
she b'long to de mos' dat I come to heah 'bout it pooty soon, so I ups
en settles de trouble by tellin' 'um she don't b'long to none uv um, but
to you en me; en I ast 'm if dey gwyne to grab a young white genlman's
propaty, en git a hid'n for it?  Den I gin 'm ten cents apiece, en dey
'uz mighty well satisfied, en wisht some mo' raf's 'ud come along en
make 'm rich agin. Dey's mighty good to me, dese niggers is, en whatever
I wants 'm to do fur me I doan' have to ast 'm twice, honey.  Dat Jack's
a good nigger, en pooty smart.
Yes, he is.  He ain't ever told me you was here; told me to come, and
he'd show me a lot of water-moccasins.  If anything happens _he_ ain't
mixed up in it.  He can say he never seen us together, and it 'll be the
truth.
I don't want to talk much about the next day.  I reckon I'll cut it
pretty short.  I waked up about dawn, and was a-going to turn over and
go to sleep again when I noticed how still it was--didn't seem to be
anybody stirring.  That warn't usual.  Next I noticed that Buck was
up and gone. Well, I gets up, a-wondering, and goes down stairs--nobody
around; everything as still as a mouse.  Just the same outside.  Thinks
I, what does it mean?  Down by the wood-pile I comes across my Jack, and
says:
What's it all about?
Says he:
Don't you know, Mars Jawge?
No, says I, I don't.
Well, den, Miss Sophia's run off! 'deed she has.  She run off in de
night some time--nobody don't know jis' when; run off to get married
to dat young Harney Shepherdson, you know--leastways, so dey 'spec.  De
fambly foun' it out 'bout half an hour ago--maybe a little mo'--en' I
_tell_ you dey warn't no time los'.  Sich another hurryin' up guns
en hosses _you_ never see!  De women folks has gone for to stir up de
relations, en ole Mars Saul en de boys tuck dey guns en rode up de
river road for to try to ketch dat young man en kill him 'fo' he kin
git acrost de river wid Miss Sophia.  I reck'n dey's gwyne to be mighty
rough times.
Buck went off 'thout waking me up.
Well, I reck'n he _did_!  Dey warn't gwyne to mix you up in it.
Mars Buck he loaded up his gun en 'lowed he's gwyne to fetch home a
Shepherdson or bust. Well, dey'll be plenty un 'm dah, I reck'n, en you
bet you he'll fetch one ef he gits a chanst.
I took up the river road as hard as I could put.  By and by I begin to
hear guns a good ways off.  When I come in sight of the log store and
the woodpile where the steamboats lands I worked along under the trees
and brush till I got to a good place, and then I clumb up into the
forks of a cottonwood that was out of reach, and watched.  There was a
wood-rank four foot high a little ways in front of the tree, and first I
was going to hide behind that; but maybe it was luckier I didn't.
There was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open
place before the log store, cussing and yelling, and trying to get at
a couple of young chaps that was behind the wood-rank alongside of the
steamboat landing; but they couldn't come it.  Every time one of them
showed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at.  The
two boys was squatting back to back behind the pile, so they could watch
both ways.
By and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling.  They started
riding towards the store; then up gets one of the boys, draws a steady
bead over the wood-rank, and drops one of them out of his saddle.  All
the men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started
to carry him to the store; and that minute the two boys started on the
run.  They got half way to the tree I was in before the men noticed.
Then the men see them, and jumped on their horses and took out after
them.  They gained on the boys, but it didn't do no good, the boys had
too good a start; they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree,
and slipped in behind it, and so they had the bulge on the men again.
One of the boys was Buck, and the other was a slim young chap about
nineteen years old.
The men ripped around awhile, and then rode away.  As soon as they was
out of sight I sung out to Buck and told him.  He didn't know what
to make of my voice coming out of the tree at first.  He was awful
surprised.  He told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the
men come in sight again; said they was up to some devilment or
other--wouldn't be gone long.  I wished I was out of that tree, but I
dasn't come down.  Buck begun to cry and rip, and 'lowed that him and
his cousin Joe (that was the other young chap) would make up for this
day yet.  He said his father and his two brothers was killed, and two
or three of the enemy.  Said the Shepherdsons laid for them in
ambush.  Buck said his father and brothers ought to waited for their
relations--the Shepherdsons was too strong for them.  I asked him what
was become of young Harney and Miss Sophia.  He said they'd got across
the river and was safe.  I was glad of that; but the way Buck did take
on because he didn't manage to kill Harney that day he shot at him--I
hain't ever heard anything like it.
All of a sudden, bang! bang! bang! goes three or four guns--the men had
slipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their
horses!  The boys jumped for the river--both of them hurt--and as they
swum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and
singing out, Kill them, kill them!  It made me so sick I most fell out
of the tree.  I ain't a-going to tell _all_ that happened--it would make
me sick again if I was to do that.  I wished I hadn't ever come ashore
that night to see such things.  I ain't ever going to get shut of
them--lots of times I dream about them.
I stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark, afraid to come down.
Sometimes I heard guns away off in the woods; and twice I seen little
gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns; so I reckoned the
trouble was still a-going on.  I was mighty downhearted; so I made up my
mind I wouldn't ever go anear that house again, because I reckoned I
was to blame, somehow. I judged that that piece of paper meant that Miss
Sophia was to meet Harney somewheres at half-past two and run off; and
I judged I ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way
she acted, and then maybe he would a locked her up, and this awful mess
wouldn't ever happened.
When I got down out of the tree I crept along down the river bank a
piece, and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water, and
tugged at them till I got them ashore; then I covered up their faces,
and got away as quick as I could.  I cried a little when I was covering
up Buck's face, for he was mighty good to me.
It was just dark now.  I never went near the house, but struck through
the woods and made for the swamp.  Jim warn't on his island, so I
tramped off in a hurry for the crick, and crowded through the willows,
red-hot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country.  The raft was
gone!  My souls, but I was scared!  I couldn't get my breath for most
a minute. Then I raised a yell.  A voice not twenty-five foot from me
says:
Good lan'! is dat you, honey?  Doan' make no noise.
It was Jim's voice--nothing ever sounded so good before.  I run along the
bank a piece and got aboard, and Jim he grabbed me and hugged me, he was
so glad to see me.  He says:
Laws bless you, chile, I 'uz right down sho' you's dead agin.  Jack's
been heah; he say he reck'n you's ben shot, kase you didn' come home no
mo'; so I's jes' dis minute a startin' de raf' down towards de mouf er
de crick, so's to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as Jack
comes agin en tells me for certain you _is_ dead.  Lawsy, I's mighty
glad to git you back again, honey.
I says:
All right--that's mighty good; they won't find me, and they'll think
I've been killed, and floated down the river--there's something up there
that 'll help them think so--so don't you lose no time, Jim, but just
shove off for the big water as fast as ever you can.
I never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in
the middle of the Mississippi.  Then we hung up our signal lantern, and
judged that we was free and safe once more.  I hadn't had a bite to eat
since yesterday, so Jim he got out some corn-dodgers and buttermilk,
and pork and cabbage and greens--there ain't nothing in the world so good
when it's cooked right--and whilst I eat my supper we talked and had a
good time.  I was powerful glad to get away from the feuds, and so was
Jim to get away from the swamp.  We said there warn't no home like a
raft, after all.  Other places do seem so cramped up and smothery, but a
raft don't.  You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft.
CHAPTER XIX.
TWO or three days and nights went by; I reckon I might say they swum by,
they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely.  Here is the way we put
in the time.  It was a monstrous big river down there--sometimes a mile
and a half wide; we run nights, and laid up and hid daytimes; soon as
night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up--nearly always
in the dead water under a towhead; and then cut young cottonwoods and
willows, and hid the raft with them.  Then we set out the lines.  Next
we slid into the river and had a swim, so as to freshen up and cool
off; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee
deep, and watched the daylight come.  Not a sound anywheres--perfectly
still--just like the whole world was asleep, only sometimes the bullfrogs
a-cluttering, maybe.  The first thing to see, looking away over the
water, was a kind of dull line--that was the woods on t'other side; you
couldn't make nothing else out; then a pale place in the sky; then more
paleness spreading around; then the river softened up away off, and
warn't black any more, but gray; you could see little dark spots
drifting along ever so far away--trading scows, and such things; and
long black streaks--rafts; sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking; or
jumbled up voices, it was so still, and sounds come so far; and by and
by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the
streak that there's a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it
and makes that streak look that way; and you see the mist curl up off
of the water, and the east reddens up, and the river, and you make out a
log-cabin in the edge of the woods, away on the bank on t'other side of
the river, being a woodyard, likely, and piled by them cheats so you can
throw a dog through it anywheres; then the nice breeze springs up, and
comes fanning you from over there, so cool and fresh and sweet to smell
on account of the woods and the flowers; but sometimes not that way,
because they've left dead fish laying around, gars and such, and they
do get pretty rank; and next you've got the full day, and everything
smiling in the sun, and the song-birds just going it!
A little smoke couldn't be noticed now, so we would take some fish off
of the lines and cook up a hot breakfast.  And afterwards we would watch
the lonesomeness of the river, and kind of lazy along, and by and by
lazy off to sleep.  Wake up by and by, and look to see what done it, and
maybe see a steamboat coughing along up-stream, so far off towards the
other side you couldn't tell nothing about her only whether she was
a stern-wheel or side-wheel; then for about an hour there wouldn't be
nothing to hear nor nothing to see--just solid lonesomeness.  Next
you'd see a raft sliding by, away off yonder, and maybe a galoot on it
chopping, because they're most always doing it on a raft; you'd see the
axe flash and come down--you don't hear nothing; you see that axe go
up again, and by the time it's above the man's head then you hear the
_k'chunk_!--it had took all that time to come over the water.  So we
would put in the day, lazying around, listening to the stillness.  Once
there was a thick fog, and the rafts and things that went by was beating
tin pans so the steamboats wouldn't run over them.  A scow or a
raft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and
laughing--heard them plain; but we couldn't see no sign of them; it made
you feel crawly; it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air.
Jim said he believed it was spirits; but I says:
No; spirits wouldn't say, 'Dern the dern fog.'
Soon as it was night out we shoved; when we got her out to about the
middle we let her alone, and let her float wherever the current wanted
her to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the water, and
talked about all kinds of things--we was always naked, day and night,
whenever the mosquitoes would let us--the new clothes Buck's folks made
for me was too good to be comfortable, and besides I didn't go much on
clothes, nohow.
Sometimes we'd have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest
time. Yonder was the banks and the islands, across the water; and maybe
a spark--which was a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on the water
you could see a spark or two--on a raft or a scow, you know; and maybe
you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts.
It's lovely to live on a raft.  We had the sky up there, all speckled
with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them, and
discuss about whether they was made or only just happened.  Jim he
allowed they was made, but I allowed they happened; I judged it would
have took too long to _make_ so many.  Jim said the moon could a _laid_
them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I didn't say nothing
against it, because I've seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it
could be done. We used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see them
streak down.  Jim allowed they'd got spoiled and was hove out of the
nest.
Once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the
dark, and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out
of her chimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look awful
pretty; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and
her powwow shut off and leave the river still again; and by and by her
waves would get to us, a long time after she was gone, and joggle the
raft a bit, and after that you wouldn't hear nothing for you couldn't
tell how long, except maybe frogs or something.
After midnight the people on shore went to bed, and then for two or
three hours the shores was black--no more sparks in the cabin windows.
These sparks was our clock--the first one that showed again meant
morning was coming, so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right away.
One morning about daybreak I found a canoe and crossed over a chute to
the main shore--it was only two hundred yards--and paddled about a mile
up a crick amongst the cypress woods, to see if I couldn't get some
berries. Just as I was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossed
the crick, here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as
they could foot it.  I thought I was a goner, for whenever anybody was
after anybody I judged it was _me_--or maybe Jim.  I was about to dig out
from there in a hurry, but they was pretty close to me then, and sung
out and begged me to save their lives--said they hadn't been doing
nothing, and was being chased for it--said there was men and dogs
a-coming.  They wanted to jump right in, but I says:
Don't you do it.  I don't hear the dogs and horses yet; you've got time
to crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways; then you
take to the water and wade down to me and get in--that'll throw the dogs
off the scent.
They done it, and soon as they was aboard I lit out for our towhead,
and in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off,
shouting. We heard them come along towards the crick, but couldn't
see them; they seemed to stop and fool around a while; then, as we got
further and further away all the time, we couldn't hardly hear them at
all; by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck the
river, everything was quiet, and we paddled over to the towhead and hid
in the cottonwoods and was safe.
One of these fellows was about seventy or upwards, and had a bald head
and very gray whiskers.  He had an old battered-up slouch hat on, and
a greasy blue woollen shirt, and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed
into his boot-tops, and home-knit galluses--no, he only had one.  He had
an old long-tailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over
his arm, and both of them had big, fat, ratty-looking carpet-bags.
The other fellow was about thirty, and dressed about as ornery.  After
breakfast we all laid off and talked, and the first thing that come out
was that these chaps didn't know one another.
What got you into trouble? says the baldhead to t'other chap.
Well, I'd been selling an article to take the tartar off the teeth--and
it does take it off, too, and generly the enamel along with it--but I
stayed about one night longer than I ought to, and was just in the act
of sliding out when I ran across you on the trail this side of town, and
you told me they were coming, and begged me to help you to get off.  So
I told you I was expecting trouble myself, and would scatter out _with_
you. That's the whole yarn--what's yourn?
Well, I'd ben a-running' a little temperance revival thar 'bout a week,
and was the pet of the women folks, big and little, for I was makin' it
mighty warm for the rummies, I _tell_ you, and takin' as much as five
or six dollars a night--ten cents a head, children and niggers free--and
business a-growin' all the time, when somehow or another a little report
got around last night that I had a way of puttin' in my time with a
private jug on the sly.  A nigger rousted me out this mornin', and told
me the people was getherin' on the quiet with their dogs and horses, and
they'd be along pretty soon and give me 'bout half an hour's start,
and then run me down if they could; and if they got me they'd tar
and feather me and ride me on a rail, sure.  I didn't wait for no
breakfast--I warn't hungry.
Old man, said the young one, I reckon we might double-team it
together; what do you think?
I ain't undisposed.  What's your line--mainly?
Jour printer by trade; do a little in patent medicines;
theater-actor--tragedy, you know; take a turn to mesmerism and phrenology
when there's a chance; teach singing-geography school for a change;
sling a lecture sometimes--oh, I do lots of things--most anything that
comes handy, so it ain't work.  What's your lay?
I've done considerble in the doctoring way in my time.  Layin' on o'
hands is my best holt--for cancer and paralysis, and sich things; and I
k'n tell a fortune pretty good when I've got somebody along to find out
the facts for me.  Preachin's my line, too, and workin' camp-meetin's,
and missionaryin' around.
Nobody never said anything for a while; then the young man hove a sigh
and says:
Alas!
What 're you alassin' about? says the bald-head.
To think I should have lived to be leading such a life, and be degraded
down into such company.  And he begun to wipe the corner of his eye
with a rag.
Dern your skin, ain't the company good enough for you? says the
baldhead, pretty pert and uppish.
Yes, it _is_ good enough for me; it's as good as I deserve; for who
fetched me so low when I was so high?  I did myself.  I don't blame
_you_, gentlemen--far from it; I don't blame anybody.  I deserve it
all.  Let the cold world do its worst; one thing I know--there's a grave
somewhere for me. The world may go on just as it's always done, and take
everything from me--loved ones, property, everything; but it can't take
that. Some day I'll lie down in it and forget it all, and my poor broken
heart will be at rest.  He went on a-wiping.
Drot your pore broken heart, says the baldhead; what are you heaving
your pore broken heart at _us_ f'r?  _we_ hain't done nothing.
No, I know you haven't.  I ain't blaming you, gentlemen.  I brought
myself down--yes, I did it myself.  It's right I should suffer--perfectly
right--I don't make any moan.
Brought you down from whar?  Whar was you brought down from?
Ah, you would not believe me; the world never believes--let it pass--'tis
no matter.  The secret of my birth--
The secret of your birth!  Do you mean to say--
Gentlemen, says the young man, very solemn, I will reveal it to you,
for I feel I may have confidence in you.  By rights I am a duke!
Jim's eyes bugged out when he heard that; and I reckon mine did, too.
Then the baldhead says:  No! you can't mean it?
Yes.  My great-grandfather, eldest son of the Duke of Bridgewater, fled
to this country about the end of the last century, to breathe the pure
air of freedom; married here, and died, leaving a son, his own father
dying about the same time.  The second son of the late duke seized the
titles and estates--the infant real duke was ignored.  I am the lineal
descendant of that infant--I am the rightful Duke of Bridgewater; and
here am I, forlorn, torn from my high estate, hunted of men, despised
by the cold world, ragged, worn, heart-broken, and degraded to the
companionship of felons on a raft!
Jim pitied him ever so much, and so did I. We tried to comfort him, but
he said it warn't much use, he couldn't be much comforted; said if we
was a mind to acknowledge him, that would do him more good than most
anything else; so we said we would, if he would tell us how.  He said we
ought to bow when we spoke to him, and say Your Grace, or My Lord,
or Your Lordship--and he wouldn't mind it if we called him plain
Bridgewater, which, he said, was a title anyway, and not a name; and
one of us ought to wait on him at dinner, and do any little thing for
him he wanted done.
Well, that was all easy, so we done it.  All through dinner Jim stood
around and waited on him, and says, Will yo' Grace have some o' dis or
some o' dat? and so on, and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to
him.
But the old man got pretty silent by and by--didn't have much to say, and
didn't look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going on
around that duke.  He seemed to have something on his mind.  So, along
in the afternoon, he says:
Looky here, Bilgewater, he says, I'm nation sorry for you, but you
ain't the only person that's had troubles like that.
No?
No you ain't.  You ain't the only person that's ben snaked down
wrongfully out'n a high place.
Alas!
No, you ain't the only person that's had a secret of his birth.  And,
by jings, _he_ begins to cry.
Hold!  What do you mean?
Bilgewater, kin I trust you? says the old man, still sort of sobbing.
To the bitter death!  He took the old man by the hand and squeezed it,
and says, That secret of your being:  speak!
Bilgewater, I am the late Dauphin!
You bet you, Jim and me stared this time.  Then the duke says:
You are what?
Yes, my friend, it is too true--your eyes is lookin' at this very moment
on the pore disappeared Dauphin, Looy the Seventeen, son of Looy the
Sixteen and Marry Antonette.
You!  At your age!  No!  You mean you're the late Charlemagne; you must
be six or seven hundred years old, at the very least.
Trouble has done it, Bilgewater, trouble has done it; trouble has brung
these gray hairs and this premature balditude.  Yes, gentlemen, you
see before you, in blue jeans and misery, the wanderin', exiled,
trampled-on, and sufferin' rightful King of France.
Well, he cried and took on so that me and Jim didn't know hardly what to
do, we was so sorry--and so glad and proud we'd got him with us, too.
So we set in, like we done before with the duke, and tried to comfort
_him_. But he said it warn't no use, nothing but to be dead and done
with it all could do him any good; though he said it often made him feel
easier and better for a while if people treated him according to his
rights, and got down on one knee to speak to him, and always called him
Your Majesty, and waited on him first at meals, and didn't set down
in his presence till he asked them. So Jim and me set to majestying him,
and doing this and that and t'other for him, and standing up till he
told us we might set down.  This done him heaps of good, and so he
got cheerful and comfortable.  But the duke kind of soured on him, and
didn't look a bit satisfied with the way things was going; still,
the king acted real friendly towards him, and said the duke's
great-grandfather and all the other Dukes of Bilgewater was a good
deal thought of by _his_ father, and was allowed to come to the palace
considerable; but the duke stayed huffy a good while, till by and by the
king says:
Like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this h-yer
raft, Bilgewater, and so what's the use o' your bein' sour?  It 'll only
make things oncomfortable.  It ain't my fault I warn't born a duke,
it ain't your fault you warn't born a king--so what's the use to worry?
Make the best o' things the way you find 'em, says I--that's my motto.
This ain't no bad thing that we've struck here--plenty grub and an easy
life--come, give us your hand, duke, and le's all be friends.
The duke done it, and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it.  It took
away all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it, because
it would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the
raft; for what you want, above all things, on a raft, is for everybody
to be satisfied, and feel right and kind towards the others.
It didn't take me long to make up my mind that these liars warn't no
kings nor dukes at all, but just low-down humbugs and frauds.  But I
never said nothing, never let on; kept it to myself; it's the best way;
then you don't have no quarrels, and don't get into no trouble.  If they
wanted us to call them kings and dukes, I hadn't no objections, 'long as
it would keep peace in the family; and it warn't no use to tell Jim, so
I didn't tell him.  If I never learnt nothing else out of pap, I learnt
that the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let them
have their own way.
CHAPTER XX.
THEY asked us considerable many questions; wanted to know what we
covered up the raft that way for, and laid by in the daytime instead of
running--was Jim a runaway nigger?  Says I:
Goodness sakes! would a runaway nigger run _south_?
No, they allowed he wouldn't.  I had to account for things some way, so
I says:
My folks was living in Pike County, in Missouri, where I was born, and
they all died off but me and pa and my brother Ike.  Pa, he 'lowed
he'd break up and go down and live with Uncle Ben, who's got a little
one-horse place on the river, forty-four mile below Orleans.  Pa was
pretty poor, and had some debts; so when he'd squared up there warn't
nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger, Jim.  That warn't
enough to take us fourteen hundred mile, deck passage nor no other way.
Well, when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day; he ketched
this piece of a raft; so we reckoned we'd go down to Orleans on it.
Pa's luck didn't hold out; a steamboat run over the forrard corner of
the raft one night, and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel;
Jim and me come up all right, but pa was drunk, and Ike was only four
years old, so they never come up no more.  Well, for the next day or
two we had considerable trouble, because people was always coming out in
skiffs and trying to take Jim away from me, saying they believed he was
a runaway nigger.  We don't run daytimes no more now; nights they don't
bother us.
The duke says:
Leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we
want to.  I'll think the thing over--I'll invent a plan that'll fix it.
We'll let it alone for to-day, because of course we don't want to go by
that town yonder in daylight--it mightn't be healthy.
Towards night it begun to darken up and look like rain; the heat
lightning was squirting around low down in the sky, and the leaves was
beginning to shiver--it was going to be pretty ugly, it was easy to see
that.  So the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam, to see
what the beds was like.  My bed was a straw tick better than Jim's,
which was a corn-shuck tick; there's always cobs around about in a shuck
tick, and they poke into you and hurt; and when you roll over the dry
shucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves; it
makes such a rustling that you wake up.  Well, the duke allowed he would
take my bed; but the king allowed he wouldn't.  He says:
I should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that
a corn-shuck bed warn't just fitten for me to sleep on.  Your Grace 'll
take the shuck bed yourself.
Jim and me was in a sweat again for a minute, being afraid there was
going to be some more trouble amongst them; so we was pretty glad when
the duke says:
'Tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of
oppression.  Misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit; I yield, I
submit; 'tis my fate.  I am alone in the world--let me suffer; can bear
it.
We got away as soon as it was good and dark.  The king told us to stand
well out towards the middle of the river, and not show a light till we
got a long ways below the town.  We come in sight of the little bunch of
lights by and by--that was the town, you know--and slid by, about a half
a mile out, all right.  When we was three-quarters of a mile below we
hoisted up our signal lantern; and about ten o'clock it come on to rain
and blow and thunder and lighten like everything; so the king told us
to both stay on watch till the weather got better; then him and the duke
crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night.  It was my watch
below till twelve, but I wouldn't a turned in anyway if I'd had a bed,
because a body don't see such a storm as that every day in the week, not
by a long sight.  My souls, how the wind did scream along!  And every
second or two there'd come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half
a mile around, and you'd see the islands looking dusty through the rain,
and the trees thrashing around in the wind; then comes a H-WHACK!--bum!
bum! bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum--and the thunder would go rumbling
and grumbling away, and quit--and then RIP comes another flash and
another sockdolager.  The waves most washed me off the raft sometimes,
but I hadn't any clothes on, and didn't mind.  We didn't have no trouble
about snags; the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant
that we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or
that and miss them.
I had the middle watch, you know, but I was pretty sleepy by that time,
so Jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me; he was always
mighty good that way, Jim was.  I crawled into the wigwam, but the king
and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warn't no show for
me; so I laid outside--I didn't mind the rain, because it was warm, and
the waves warn't running so high now.  About two they come up again,
though, and Jim was going to call me; but he changed his mind, because
he reckoned they warn't high enough yet to do any harm; but he was
mistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a
regular ripper and washed me overboard.  It most killed Jim a-laughing.
He was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was, anyway.
I took the watch, and Jim he laid down and snored away; and by and by
the storm let up for good and all; and the first cabin-light that showed
I rousted him out, and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the
day.
The king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast, and him
and the duke played seven-up a while, five cents a game.  Then they got
tired of it, and allowed they would lay out a campaign, as they called
it. The duke went down into his carpet-bag, and fetched up a lot of
little printed bills and read them out loud.  One bill said, The
celebrated Dr. Armand de Montalban, of Paris, would lecture on the
Science of Phrenology at such and such a place, on the blank day of
blank, at ten cents admission, and furnish charts of character at
twenty-five cents apiece.  The duke said that was _him_.  In another
bill he was the world-renowned Shakespearian tragedian, Garrick the
Younger, of Drury Lane, London.  In other bills he had a lot of other
names and done other wonderful things, like finding water and gold with
a divining-rod, dissipating witch spells, and so on.  By and by he
says:
But the histrionic muse is the darling.  Have you ever trod the boards,
Royalty?
No, says the king.
You shall, then, before you're three days older, Fallen Grandeur, says
the duke.  The first good town we come to we'll hire a hall and do the
sword fight in Richard III. and the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet.
How does that strike you?
I'm in, up to the hub, for anything that will pay, Bilgewater; but, you
see, I don't know nothing about play-actin', and hain't ever seen much
of it.  I was too small when pap used to have 'em at the palace.  Do you
reckon you can learn me?
Easy!
All right.  I'm jist a-freezn' for something fresh, anyway.  Le's
commence right away.
So the duke he told him all about who Romeo was and who Juliet was, and
said he was used to being Romeo, so the king could be Juliet.
But if Juliet's such a young gal, duke, my peeled head and my white
whiskers is goin' to look oncommon odd on her, maybe.
No, don't you worry; these country jakes won't ever think of that.
Besides, you know, you'll be in costume, and that makes all the
difference in the world; Juliet's in a balcony, enjoying the moonlight
before she goes to bed, and she's got on her night-gown and her ruffled
nightcap.  Here are the costumes for the parts.
He got out two or three curtain-calico suits, which he said was
meedyevil armor for Richard III. and t'other chap, and a long white
cotton nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match.  The king was
satisfied; so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the
most splendid spread-eagle way, prancing around and acting at the same
time, to show how it had got to be done; then he give the book to the
king and told him to get his part by heart.
There was a little one-horse town about three mile down the bend, and
after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run
in daylight without it being dangersome for Jim; so he allowed he would
go down to the town and fix that thing.  The king allowed he would go,
too, and see if he couldn't strike something.  We was out of coffee, so
Jim said I better go along with them in the canoe and get some.
When we got there there warn't nobody stirring; streets empty, and
perfectly dead and still, like Sunday.  We found a sick nigger sunning
himself in a back yard, and he said everybody that warn't too young or
too sick or too old was gone to camp-meeting, about two mile back in the
woods.  The king got the directions, and allowed he'd go and work that
camp-meeting for all it was worth, and I might go, too.
The duke said what he was after was a printing-office.  We found it;
a little bit of a concern, up over a carpenter shop--carpenters and
printers all gone to the meeting, and no doors locked.  It was a dirty,
littered-up place, and had ink marks, and handbills with pictures of
horses and runaway niggers on them, all over the walls.  The duke shed
his coat and said he was all right now.  So me and the king lit out for
the camp-meeting.
We got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping, for it was a most
awful hot day.  There was as much as a thousand people there from
twenty mile around.  The woods was full of teams and wagons, hitched
everywheres, feeding out of the wagon-troughs and stomping to keep
off the flies.  There was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with
branches, where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell, and piles of
watermelons and green corn and such-like truck.
The preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds, only they was
bigger and held crowds of people.  The benches was made out of outside
slabs of logs, with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into
for legs. They didn't have no backs.  The preachers had high platforms
to stand on at one end of the sheds.  The women had on sun-bonnets;
and some had linsey-woolsey frocks, some gingham ones, and a few of the
young ones had on calico.  Some of the young men was barefooted, and
some of the children didn't have on any clothes but just a tow-linen
shirt.  Some of the old women was knitting, and some of the young folks
was courting on the sly.
The first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn.  He lined
out two lines, everybody sung it, and it was kind of grand to hear it,
there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way; then
he lined out two more for them to sing--and so on.  The people woke up
more and more, and sung louder and louder; and towards the end some
begun to groan, and some begun to shout.  Then the preacher begun to
preach, and begun in earnest, too; and went weaving first to one side of
the platform and then the other, and then a-leaning down over the front
of it, with his arms and his body going all the time, and shouting his
words out with all his might; and every now and then he would hold up
his Bible and spread it open, and kind of pass it around this way and
that, shouting, It's the brazen serpent in the wilderness!  Look upon
it and live!  And people would shout out, Glory!--A-a-_men_!  And so
he went on, and the people groaning and crying and saying amen:
Oh, come to the mourners' bench! come, black with sin! (_Amen_!) come,
sick and sore! (_Amen_!) come, lame and halt and blind! (_Amen_!) come,
pore and needy, sunk in shame! (_A-A-Men_!) come, all that's worn and
soiled and suffering!--come with a broken spirit! come with a contrite
heart! come in your rags and sin and dirt! the waters that cleanse
is free, the door of heaven stands open--oh, enter in and be at rest!
(_A-A-Men_!  _Glory, Glory Hallelujah!_)
And so on.  You couldn't make out what the preacher said any more, on
account of the shouting and crying.  Folks got up everywheres in the
crowd, and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners'
bench, with the tears running down their faces; and when all the
mourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd, they sung and
shouted and flung themselves down on the straw, just crazy and wild.
Well, the first I knowed the king got a-going, and you could hear him
over everybody; and next he went a-charging up on to the platform, and
the preacher he begged him to speak to the people, and he done it.  He
told them he was a pirate--been a pirate for thirty years out in the
Indian Ocean--and his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in
a fight, and he was home now to take out some fresh men, and thanks to
goodness he'd been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat
without a cent, and he was glad of it; it was the blessedest thing that
ever happened to him, because he was a changed man now, and happy for
the first time in his life; and, poor as he was, he was going to start
right off and work his way back to the Indian Ocean, and put in the rest
of his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path; for he could
do it better than anybody else, being acquainted with all pirate crews
in that ocean; and though it would take him a long time to get there
without money, he would get there anyway, and every time he convinced
a pirate he would say to him, Don't you thank me, don't you give me no
credit; it all belongs to them dear people in Pokeville camp-meeting,
natural brothers and benefactors of the race, and that dear preacher
there, the truest friend a pirate ever had!
And then he busted into tears, and so did everybody.  Then somebody
sings out, Take up a collection for him, take up a collection!  Well,
a half a dozen made a jump to do it, but somebody sings out, Let _him_
pass the hat around!  Then everybody said it, the preacher too.
So the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes,
and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being
so good to the poor pirates away off there; and every little while the
prettiest kind of girls, with the tears running down their cheeks, would
up and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by; and he
always done it; and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or
six times--and he was invited to stay a week; and everybody wanted him to
live in their houses, and said they'd think it was an honor; but he said
as this was the last day of the camp-meeting he couldn't do no good, and
besides he was in a sweat to get to the Indian Ocean right off and go to
work on the pirates.
When we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had
collected eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents.  And then he had
fetched away a three-gallon jug of whisky, too, that he found under a
wagon when he was starting home through the woods.  The king said,
take it all around, it laid over any day he'd ever put in in the
missionarying line.  He said it warn't no use talking, heathens don't
amount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a camp-meeting with.
The duke was thinking _he'd_ been doing pretty well till the king come
to show up, but after that he didn't think so so much.  He had set
up and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that
printing-office--horse bills--and took the money, four dollars.  And he
had got in ten dollars' worth of advertisements for the paper, which he
said he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advance--so
they done it. The price of the paper was two dollars a year, but he took
in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them
paying him in advance; they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as
usual, but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the
price as low as he could afford it, and was going to run it for cash.
He set up a little piece of poetry, which he made, himself, out of
his own head--three verses--kind of sweet and saddish--the name of it was,
Yes, crush, cold world, this breaking heart--and he left that all set
up and ready to print in the paper, and didn't charge nothing for it.
Well, he took in nine dollars and a half, and said he'd done a pretty
square day's work for it.
Then he showed us another little job he'd printed and hadn't charged
for, because it was for us.  It had a picture of a runaway nigger with
a bundle on a stick over his shoulder, and $200 reward under it.  The
reading was all about Jim, and just described him to a dot.  It said
he run away from St. Jacques' plantation, forty mile below New Orleans,
last winter, and likely went north, and whoever would catch him and send
him back he could have the reward and expenses.
Now, says the duke, after to-night we can run in the daytime if we
want to.  Whenever we see anybody coming we can tie Jim hand and foot
with a rope, and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we
captured him up the river, and were too poor to travel on a steamboat,
so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down
to get the reward.  Handcuffs and chains would look still better on Jim,
but it wouldn't go well with the story of us being so poor.  Too much
like jewelry.  Ropes are the correct thing--we must preserve the unities,
as we say on the boards.
We all said the duke was pretty smart, and there couldn't be no trouble
about running daytimes.  We judged we could make miles enough that night
to get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the duke's work in
the printing office was going to make in that little town; then we could
boom right along if we wanted to.
We laid low and kept still, and never shoved out till nearly ten
o'clock; then we slid by, pretty wide away from the town, and didn't
hoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it.
When Jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning, he says:
Huck, does you reck'n we gwyne to run acrost any mo' kings on dis
trip?
No, I says, I reckon not.
Well, says he, dat's all right, den.  I doan' mine one er two kings,
but dat's enough.  Dis one's powerful drunk, en de duke ain' much
better.
I found Jim had been trying to get him to talk French, so he could hear
what it was like; but he said he had been in this country so long, and
had so much trouble, he'd forgot it.
CHAPTER XXI.
IT was after sun-up now, but we went right on and didn't tie up.  The
king and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty rusty; but after
they'd jumped overboard and took a swim it chippered them up a good
deal. After breakfast the king he took a seat on the corner of the raft,
and pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches, and let his legs
dangle in the water, so as to be comfortable, and lit his pipe, and went
to getting his Romeo and Juliet by heart.  When he had got it pretty
good him and the duke begun to practice it together.  The duke had to
learn him over and over again how to say every speech; and he made him
sigh, and put his hand on his heart, and after a while he said he done
it pretty well; only, he says, you mustn't bellow out _Romeo_!
that way, like a bull--you must say it soft and sick and languishy,
so--R-o-o-meo! that is the idea; for Juliet's a dear sweet mere child of
a girl, you know, and she doesn't bray like a jackass.
Well, next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made out
of oak laths, and begun to practice the sword fight--the duke called
himself Richard III.; and the way they laid on and pranced around
the raft was grand to see.  But by and by the king tripped and fell
overboard, and after that they took a rest, and had a talk about all
kinds of adventures they'd had in other times along the river.
After dinner the duke says:
Well, Capet, we'll want to make this a first-class show, you know, so
I guess we'll add a little more to it.  We want a little something to
answer encores with, anyway.
What's onkores, Bilgewater?
The duke told him, and then says:
I'll answer by doing the Highland fling or the sailor's hornpipe; and
you--well, let me see--oh, I've got it--you can do Hamlet's soliloquy.
Hamlet's which?
Hamlet's soliloquy, you know; the most celebrated thing in Shakespeare.
Ah, it's sublime, sublime!  Always fetches the house.  I haven't got
it in the book--I've only got one volume--but I reckon I can piece it out
from memory.  I'll just walk up and down a minute, and see if I can call
it back from recollection's vaults.
So he went to marching up and down, thinking, and frowning horrible
every now and then; then he would hoist up his eyebrows; next he would
squeeze his hand on his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan; next
he would sigh, and next he'd let on to drop a tear.  It was beautiful
to see him. By and by he got it.  He told us to give attention.  Then
he strikes a most noble attitude, with one leg shoved forwards, and his
arms stretched away up, and his head tilted back, looking up at the sky;
and then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth; and after that,
all through his speech, he howled, and spread around, and swelled up his
chest, and just knocked the spots out of any acting ever I see before.
This is the speech--I learned it, easy enough, while he was learning it
to the king:
To be, or not to be; that is the bare bodkin That makes calamity of
so long life; For who would fardels bear, till Birnam Wood do come
to Dunsinane, But that the fear of something after death Murders the
innocent sleep, Great nature's second course, And makes us rather sling
the arrows of outrageous fortune Than fly to others that we know not of.
There's the respect must give us pause: Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I
would thou couldst; For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, The
oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, The law's delay, and the
quietus which his pangs might take. In the dead waste and middle of the
night, when churchyards yawn In customary suits of solemn black, But
that the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns,
Breathes forth contagion on the world, And thus the native hue of
resolution, like the poor cat i' the adage, Is sicklied o'er with care.
And all the clouds that lowered o'er our housetops, With this
regard their currents turn awry, And lose the name of action. 'Tis a
consummation devoutly to be wished. But soft you, the fair Ophelia: Ope
not thy ponderous and marble jaws. But get thee to a nunnery&mdash;go!
Well, the old man he liked that speech, and he mighty soon got it so he
could do it first rate. It seemed like he was just born for it; and when
he had his hand in and was excited, it was perfectly lovely the way he
would rip and tear and rair up behind when he was getting it off.
The first chance we got, the duke he had some show bills printed; and
after that, for two or three days as we floated along, the raft was a
most uncommon lively place, for there warn't nothing but sword-fighting
and rehearsing--as the duke called it--going on all the time. One morning,
when we was pretty well down the State of Arkansaw, we come in sight
of a little one-horse town in a big bend; so we tied up about
three-quarters of a mile above it, in the mouth of a crick which was
shut in like a tunnel by the cypress trees, and all of us but Jim took
the canoe and went down there to see if there was any chance in that
place for our show.
We struck it mighty lucky; there was going to be a circus there that
afternoon, and the country people was already beginning to come in, in
all kinds of old shackly wagons, and on horses. The circus would leave
before night, so our show would have a pretty good chance. The duke he
hired the court house, and we went around and stuck up our bills. They
read like this:

Then we went loafing around the town. The stores and houses was most all
old shackly dried-up frame concerns that hadn't ever been painted; they
was set up three or four foot above ground on stilts, so as to be out of
reach of the water when the river was overflowed. The houses had little
gardens around them, but they didn't seem to raise hardly anything in
them but jimpson weeds, and sunflowers, and ash-piles, and old curled-up
boots and shoes, and pieces of bottles, and rags, and played-out
tin-ware. The fences was made of different kinds of boards, nailed on
at different times; and they leaned every which-way, and had gates that
didn't generly have but one hinge--a leather one. Some of the fences
had been whitewashed, some time or another, but the duke said it was in
Clumbus's time, like enough. There was generly hogs in the garden, and
people driving them out.
All the stores was along one street.  They had white domestic awnings in
front, and the country people hitched their horses to the awning-posts.
There was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings, and loafers roosting
on them all day long, whittling them with their Barlow knives; and
chawing tobacco, and gaping and yawning and stretching--a mighty ornery
lot. They generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella,
but didn't wear no coats nor waistcoats, they called one another Bill,
and Buck, and Hank, and Joe, and Andy, and talked lazy and drawly, and
used considerable many cuss words.  There was as many as one loafer
leaning up against every awning-post, and he most always had his hands
in his britches-pockets, except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw
of tobacco or scratch.  What a body was hearing amongst them all the
time was:
Gimme a chaw 'v tobacker, Hank.
Cain't; I hain't got but one chaw left.  Ask Bill.
Maybe Bill he gives him a chaw; maybe he lies and says he ain't got
none. Some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world, nor a
chaw of tobacco of their own.  They get all their chawing by borrowing;
they say to a fellow, I wisht you'd len' me a chaw, Jack, I jist this
minute give Ben Thompson the last chaw I had--which is a lie pretty
much everytime; it don't fool nobody but a stranger; but Jack ain't no
stranger, so he says:
_You_ give him a chaw, did you?  So did your sister's cat's
grandmother. You pay me back the chaws you've awready borry'd off'n me,
Lafe Buckner, then I'll loan you one or two ton of it, and won't charge
you no back intrust, nuther.
Well, I _did_ pay you back some of it wunst.
Yes, you did--'bout six chaws.  You borry'd store tobacker and paid back
nigger-head.
Store tobacco is flat black plug, but these fellows mostly chaws the
natural leaf twisted.  When they borrow a chaw they don't generly cut it
off with a knife, but set the plug in between their teeth, and gnaw with
their teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it in
two; then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it
when it's handed back, and says, sarcastic:
Here, gimme the _chaw_, and you take the _plug_.
All the streets and lanes was just mud; they warn't nothing else _but_
mud--mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places,
and two or three inches deep in _all_ the places.  The hogs loafed and
grunted around everywheres.  You'd see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs
come lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way,
where folks had to walk around her, and she'd stretch out and shut her
eyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her, and look as
happy as if she was on salary. And pretty soon you'd hear a loafer
sing out, Hi!  _so_ boy! sick him, Tige! and away the sow would go,
squealing most horrible, with a dog or two swinging to each ear, and
three or four dozen more a-coming; and then you would see all the
loafers get up and watch the thing out of sight, and laugh at the fun
and look grateful for the noise.  Then they'd settle back again till
there was a dog fight.  There couldn't anything wake them up all over,
and make them happy all over, like a dog fight--unless it might be
putting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him, or tying a
tin pan to his tail and see him run himself to death.
On the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank,
and they was bowed and bent, and about ready to tumble in. The people
had moved out of them.  The bank was caved away under one corner of some
others, and that corner was hanging over.  People lived in them yet, but
it was dangersome, because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house
caves in at a time.  Sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep
will start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the
river in one summer. Such a town as that has to be always moving back,
and back, and back, because the river's always gnawing at it.
The nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was the
wagons and horses in the streets, and more coming all the time.
Families fetched their dinners with them from the country, and eat them
in the wagons.  There was considerable whisky drinking going on, and I
seen three fights.  By and by somebody sings out:
Here comes old Boggs!--in from the country for his little old monthly
drunk; here he comes, boys!
All the loafers looked glad; I reckoned they was used to having fun out
of Boggs.  One of them says:
Wonder who he's a-gwyne to chaw up this time.  If he'd a-chawed up all
the men he's ben a-gwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year he'd have
considerable ruputation now.
Another one says, I wisht old Boggs 'd threaten me, 'cuz then I'd know
I warn't gwyne to die for a thousan' year.
Boggs comes a-tearing along on his horse, whooping and yelling like an
Injun, and singing out:
Cler the track, thar.  I'm on the waw-path, and the price uv coffins is
a-gwyne to raise.
He was drunk, and weaving about in his saddle; he was over fifty year
old, and had a very red face.  Everybody yelled at him and laughed at
him and sassed him, and he sassed back, and said he'd attend to them and
lay them out in their regular turns, but he couldn't wait now because
he'd come to town to kill old Colonel Sherburn, and his motto was, Meat
first, and spoon vittles to top off on.
He see me, and rode up and says:
Whar'd you come f'm, boy?  You prepared to die?
Then he rode on.  I was scared, but a man says:
He don't mean nothing; he's always a-carryin' on like that when he's
drunk.  He's the best naturedest old fool in Arkansaw--never hurt nobody,
drunk nor sober.
Boggs rode up before the biggest store in town, and bent his head down
so he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells:
Come out here, Sherburn! Come out and meet the man you've swindled.
You're the houn' I'm after, and I'm a-gwyne to have you, too!
And so he went on, calling Sherburn everything he could lay his tongue
to, and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing and
going on.  By and by a proud-looking man about fifty-five--and he was a
heap the best dressed man in that town, too--steps out of the store, and
the crowd drops back on each side to let him come.  He says to Boggs,
mighty ca'm and slow--he says:
I'm tired of this, but I'll endure it till one o'clock.  Till one
o'clock, mind--no longer.  If you open your mouth against me only once
after that time you can't travel so far but I will find you.
Then he turns and goes in.  The crowd looked mighty sober; nobody
stirred, and there warn't no more laughing.  Boggs rode off
blackguarding Sherburn as loud as he could yell, all down the street;
and pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store, still keeping
it up.  Some men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up,
but he wouldn't; they told him it would be one o'clock in about fifteen
minutes, and so he _must_ go home--he must go right away.  But it didn't
do no good.  He cussed away with all his might, and throwed his hat down
in the mud and rode over it, and pretty soon away he went a-raging down
the street again, with his gray hair a-flying. Everybody that could get
a chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they
could lock him up and get him sober; but it warn't no use--up the street
he would tear again, and give Sherburn another cussing.  By and by
somebody says:
Go for his daughter!--quick, go for his daughter; sometimes he'll listen
to her.  If anybody can persuade him, she can.
So somebody started on a run.  I walked down street a ways and stopped.
In about five or ten minutes here comes Boggs again, but not on his
horse.  He was a-reeling across the street towards me, bare-headed, with
a friend on both sides of him a-holt of his arms and hurrying him along.
He was quiet, and looked uneasy; and he warn't hanging back any, but was
doing some of the hurrying himself.  Somebody sings out:
Boggs!
I looked over there to see who said it, and it was that Colonel
Sherburn. He was standing perfectly still in the street, and had a
pistol raised in his right hand--not aiming it, but holding it out with
the barrel tilted up towards the sky.  The same second I see a young
girl coming on the run, and two men with her.  Boggs and the men turned
round to see who called him, and when they see the pistol the men
jumped to one side, and the pistol-barrel come down slow and steady to
a level--both barrels cocked. Boggs throws up both of his hands and says,
O Lord, don't shoot!  Bang! goes the first shot, and he staggers back,
clawing at the air--bang! goes the second one, and he tumbles backwards
on to the ground, heavy and solid, with his arms spread out.  That young
girl screamed out and comes rushing, and down she throws herself on her
father, crying, and saying, Oh, he's killed him, he's killed him!  The
crowd closed up around them, and shouldered and jammed one another, with
their necks stretched, trying to see, and people on the inside trying to
shove them back and shouting, Back, back! give him air, give him air!
Colonel Sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground, and turned
around on his heels and walked off.
They took Boggs to a little drug store, the crowd pressing around just
the same, and the whole town following, and I rushed and got a good
place at the window, where I was close to him and could see in.  They
laid him on the floor and put one large Bible under his head, and opened
another one and spread it on his breast; but they tore open his shirt
first, and I seen where one of the bullets went in.  He made about a
dozen long gasps, his breast lifting the Bible up when he drawed in his
breath, and letting it down again when he breathed it out--and after that
he laid still; he was dead.  Then they pulled his daughter away from
him, screaming and crying, and took her off.  She was about sixteen, and
very sweet and gentle looking, but awful pale and scared.
Well, pretty soon the whole town was there, squirming and scrouging and
pushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look, but people
that had the places wouldn't give them up, and folks behind them was
saying all the time, Say, now, you've looked enough, you fellows;
'tain't right and 'tain't fair for you to stay thar all the time, and
never give nobody a chance; other folks has their rights as well as
you.
There was considerable jawing back, so I slid out, thinking maybe
there was going to be trouble.  The streets was full, and everybody was
excited. Everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened,
and there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows,
stretching their necks and listening.  One long, lanky man, with long
hair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head, and a
crooked-handled cane, marked out the places on the ground where Boggs
stood and where Sherburn stood, and the people following him around from
one place to t'other and watching everything he done, and bobbing their
heads to show they understood, and stooping a little and resting their
hands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with
his cane; and then he stood up straight and stiff where Sherburn had
stood, frowning and having his hat-brim down over his eyes, and sung
out, Boggs! and then fetched his cane down slow to a level, and says
Bang! staggered backwards, says Bang! again, and fell down flat on
his back. The people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect;
said it was just exactly the way it all happened.  Then as much as a
dozen people got out their bottles and treated him.
Well, by and by somebody said Sherburn ought to be lynched.  In about a
minute everybody was saying it; so away they went, mad and yelling, and
snatching down every clothes-line they come to to do the hanging with.
CHAPTER XXII.
THEY swarmed up towards Sherburn's house, a-whooping and raging like
Injuns, and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped
to mush, and it was awful to see.  Children was heeling it ahead of the
mob, screaming and trying to get out of the way; and every window along
the road was full of women's heads, and there was nigger boys in every
tree, and bucks and wenches looking over every fence; and as soon as the
mob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of
reach.  Lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on, scared
most to death.
They swarmed up in front of Sherburn's palings as thick as they could
jam together, and you couldn't hear yourself think for the noise.  It
was a little twenty-foot yard.  Some sung out Tear down the fence! tear
down the fence!  Then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and
smashing, and down she goes, and the front wall of the crowd begins to
roll in like a wave.
Just then Sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch,
with a double-barrel gun in his hand, and takes his stand, perfectly
ca'm and deliberate, not saying a word.  The racket stopped, and the
wave sucked back.
Sherburn never said a word--just stood there, looking down.  The
stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable.  Sherburn run his eye slow
along the crowd; and wherever it struck the people tried a little to
out-gaze him, but they couldn't; they dropped their eyes and looked
sneaky. Then pretty soon Sherburn sort of laughed; not the pleasant
kind, but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread
that's got sand in it.
Then he says, slow and scornful:
The idea of _you_ lynching anybody!  It's amusing.  The idea of you
thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a _man_!  Because you're brave
enough to tar and feather poor friendless cast-out women that come along
here, did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a
_man_?  Why, a _man's_ safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind--as
long as it's daytime and you're not behind him.
Do I know you?  I know you clear through. I was born and raised in the
South, and I've lived in the North; so I know the average all around.
The average man's a coward.  In the North he lets anybody walk over him
that wants to, and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it.
In the South one man all by himself, has stopped a stage full of men
in the daytime, and robbed the lot.  Your newspapers call you a
brave people so much that you think you are braver than any other
people--whereas you're just _as_ brave, and no braver.  Why don't your
juries hang murderers?  Because they're afraid the man's friends will
shoot them in the back, in the dark--and it's just what they _would_ do.
So they always acquit; and then a _man_ goes in the night, with a
hundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal.  Your mistake
is, that you didn't bring a man with you; that's one mistake, and the
other is that you didn't come in the dark and fetch your masks.  You
brought _part_ of a man--Buck Harkness, there--and if you hadn't had him
to start you, you'd a taken it out in blowing.
You didn't want to come.  The average man don't like trouble and
danger. _You_ don't like trouble and danger.  But if only _half_ a
man--like Buck Harkness, there--shouts 'Lynch him! lynch him!' you're
afraid to back down--afraid you'll be found out to be what you
are--_cowards_--and so you raise a yell, and hang yourselves on to that
half-a-man's coat-tail, and come raging up here, swearing what big
things you're going to do. The pitifulest thing out is a mob; that's
what an army is--a mob; they don't fight with courage that's born in
them, but with courage that's borrowed from their mass, and from their
officers.  But a mob without any _man_ at the head of it is _beneath_
pitifulness.  Now the thing for _you_ to do is to droop your tails and
go home and crawl in a hole.  If any real lynching's going to be done it
will be done in the dark, Southern fashion; and when they come they'll
bring their masks, and fetch a _man_ along.  Now _leave_--and take your
half-a-man with you--tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking
it when he says this.
The crowd washed back sudden, and then broke all apart, and went tearing
off every which way, and Buck Harkness he heeled it after them, looking
tolerable cheap.  I could a stayed if I wanted to, but I didn't want to.
I went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman
went by, and then dived in under the tent.  I had my twenty-dollar gold
piece and some other money, but I reckoned I better save it, because
there ain't no telling how soon you are going to need it, away from
home and amongst strangers that way.  You can't be too careful.  I ain't
opposed to spending money on circuses when there ain't no other way, but
there ain't no use in _wasting_ it on them.
It was a real bully circus.  It was the splendidest sight that ever was
when they all come riding in, two and two, a gentleman and lady, side
by side, the men just in their drawers and undershirts, and no shoes
nor stirrups, and resting their hands on their thighs easy and
comfortable--there must a been twenty of them--and every lady with a
lovely complexion, and perfectly beautiful, and looking just like a gang
of real sure-enough queens, and dressed in clothes that cost millions of
dollars, and just littered with diamonds.  It was a powerful fine sight;
I never see anything so lovely.  And then one by one they got up
and stood, and went a-weaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and
graceful, the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight, with their
heads bobbing and skimming along, away up there under the tent-roof, and
every lady's rose-leafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips,
and she looking like the most loveliest parasol.
And then faster and faster they went, all of them dancing, first one
foot out in the air and then the other, the horses leaning more and
more, and the ringmaster going round and round the center-pole, cracking
his whip and shouting Hi!--hi! and the clown cracking jokes behind
him; and by and by all hands dropped the reins, and every lady put her
knuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms, and then how
the horses did lean over and hump themselves!  And so one after the
other they all skipped off into the ring, and made the sweetest bow I
ever see, and then scampered out, and everybody clapped their hands and
went just about wild.
Well, all through the circus they done the most astonishing things; and
all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people.  The
ringmaster couldn't ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick
as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said; and how he ever
_could_ think of so many of them, and so sudden and so pat, was what I
couldn't noway understand. Why, I couldn't a thought of them in a year.
And by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ring--said he wanted to
ride; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was.  They argued
and tried to keep him out, but he wouldn't listen, and the whole show
come to a standstill.  Then the people begun to holler at him and make
fun of him, and that made him mad, and he begun to rip and tear; so that
stirred up the people, and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the
benches and swarm towards the ring, saying, Knock him down! throw him
out! and one or two women begun to scream.  So, then, the ringmaster
he made a little speech, and said he hoped there wouldn't be no
disturbance, and if the man would promise he wouldn't make no more
trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse.
So everybody laughed and said all right, and the man got on. The minute
he was on, the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around,
with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him, and the
drunk man hanging on to his neck, and his heels flying in the air every
jump, and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing
till tears rolled down.  And at last, sure enough, all the circus men
could do, the horse broke loose, and away he went like the very nation,
round and round the ring, with that sot laying down on him and hanging
to his neck, with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side,
and then t'other one on t'other side, and the people just crazy.  It
warn't funny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to see his danger.
But pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle,
a-reeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung up and
dropped the bridle and stood! and the horse a-going like a house afire
too.  He just stood up there, a-sailing around as easy and comfortable
as if he warn't ever drunk in his life--and then he begun to pull off his
clothes and sling them.  He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up
the air, and altogether he shed seventeen suits. And, then, there he
was, slim and handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you
ever saw, and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly
hum--and finally skipped off, and made his bow and danced off to
the dressing-room, and everybody just a-howling with pleasure and
astonishment.
Then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled, and he _was_ the
sickest ringmaster you ever see, I reckon.  Why, it was one of his own
men!  He had got up that joke all out of his own head, and never let on
to nobody. Well, I felt sheepish enough to be took in so, but I wouldn't
a been in that ringmaster's place, not for a thousand dollars.  I don't
know; there may be bullier circuses than what that one was, but I
never struck them yet. Anyways, it was plenty good enough for _me_; and
wherever I run across it, it can have all of _my_ custom every time.
Well, that night we had _our_ show; but there warn't only about twelve
people there--just enough to pay expenses.  And they laughed all the
time, and that made the duke mad; and everybody left, anyway, before
the show was over, but one boy which was asleep.  So the duke said these
Arkansaw lunkheads couldn't come up to Shakespeare; what they wanted
was low comedy--and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy, he
reckoned.  He said he could size their style.  So next morning he got
some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint, and drawed off
some handbills, and stuck them up all over the village.  The bills said:
CHAPTER XXIII.
WELL, all day him and the king was hard at it, rigging up a stage and
a curtain and a row of candles for footlights; and that night the house
was jam full of men in no time.  When the place couldn't hold no more,
the duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come on
to the stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech,
and praised up this tragedy, and said it was the most thrillingest one
that ever was; and so he went on a-bragging about the tragedy, and about
Edmund Kean the Elder, which was to play the main principal part in it;
and at last when he'd got everybody's expectations up high enough, he
rolled up the curtain, and the next minute the king come a-prancing
out on all fours, naked; and he was painted all over,
ring-streaked-and-striped, all sorts of colors, as splendid as a
rainbow.  And--but never mind the rest of his outfit; it was just wild,
but it was awful funny. The people most killed themselves laughing; and
when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes, they
roared and clapped and stormed and haw-hawed till he come back and done
it over again, and after that they made him do it another time. Well, it
would make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut.
Then the duke he lets the curtain down, and bows to the people, and says
the great tragedy will be performed only two nights more, on accounts of
pressing London engagements, where the seats is all sold already for it
in Drury Lane; and then he makes them another bow, and says if he has
succeeded in pleasing them and instructing them, he will be deeply
obleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to come
and see it.
Twenty people sings out:
What, is it over?  Is that _all_?
The duke says yes.  Then there was a fine time.  Everybody sings
out, Sold! and rose up mad, and was a-going for that stage and them
tragedians.  But a big, fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts:
Hold on!  Just a word, gentlemen.  They stopped to listen.  We are
sold--mighty badly sold.  But we don't want to be the laughing stock of
this whole town, I reckon, and never hear the last of this thing as long
as we live.  _No_.  What we want is to go out of here quiet, and talk
this show up, and sell the _rest_ of the town!  Then we'll all be in the
same boat.  Ain't that sensible? (You bet it is!--the jedge is right!
everybody sings out.) All right, then--not a word about any sell.  Go
along home, and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy.
Next day you couldn't hear nothing around that town but how splendid
that show was.  House was jammed again that night, and we sold this
crowd the same way.  When me and the king and the duke got home to the
raft we all had a supper; and by and by, about midnight, they made Jim
and me back her out and float her down the middle of the river, and
fetch her in and hide her about two mile below town.
The third night the house was crammed again--and they warn't new-comers
this time, but people that was at the show the other two nights.  I
stood by the duke at the door, and I see that every man that went in had
his pockets bulging, or something muffled up under his coat--and I see it
warn't no perfumery, neither, not by a long sight.  I smelt sickly eggs
by the barrel, and rotten cabbages, and such things; and if I know the
signs of a dead cat being around, and I bet I do, there was sixty-four
of them went in.  I shoved in there for a minute, but it was too various
for me; I couldn't stand it.  Well, when the place couldn't hold no more
people the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door
for him a minute, and then he started around for the stage door, I after
him; but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says:
Walk fast now till you get away from the houses, and then shin for the
raft like the dickens was after you!
I done it, and he done the same.  We struck the raft at the same time,
and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream, all dark and
still, and edging towards the middle of the river, nobody saying a
word. I reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the
audience, but nothing of the sort; pretty soon he crawls out from under
the wigwam, and says:
Well, how'd the old thing pan out this time, duke?  He hadn't been
up-town at all.
We never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village.
Then we lit up and had a supper, and the king and the duke fairly
laughed their bones loose over the way they'd served them people.  The
duke says:
Greenhorns, flatheads!  I knew the first house would keep mum and let
the rest of the town get roped in; and I knew they'd lay for us the
third night, and consider it was _their_ turn now.  Well, it _is_ their
turn, and I'd give something to know how much they'd take for it.  I
_would_ just like to know how they're putting in their opportunity.
They can turn it into a picnic if they want to--they brought plenty
provisions.
Them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty-five dollars in that
three nights.  I never see money hauled in by the wagon-load like that
before.  By and by, when they was asleep and snoring, Jim says:
Don't it s'prise you de way dem kings carries on, Huck?
No, I says, it don't.
Why don't it, Huck?
Well, it don't, because it's in the breed.  I reckon they're all
alike.
But, Huck, dese kings o' ourn is reglar rapscallions; dat's jist what
dey is; dey's reglar rapscallions.
Well, that's what I'm a-saying; all kings is mostly rapscallions, as
fur as I can make out.
Is dat so?
You read about them once--you'll see.  Look at Henry the Eight; this 'n
's a Sunday-school Superintendent to _him_.  And look at Charles Second,
and Louis Fourteen, and Louis Fifteen, and James Second, and Edward
Second, and Richard Third, and forty more; besides all them Saxon
heptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise Cain.  My,
you ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he was in bloom.  He _was_ a
blossom.  He used to marry a new wife every day, and chop off her head
next morning.  And he would do it just as indifferent as if he was
ordering up eggs.  'Fetch up Nell Gwynn,' he says.  They fetch her up.
Next morning, 'Chop off her head!'  And they chop it off.  'Fetch up
Jane Shore,' he says; and up she comes, Next morning, 'Chop off her
head'--and they chop it off.  'Ring up Fair Rosamun.'  Fair Rosamun
answers the bell.  Next morning, 'Chop off her head.'  And he made every
one of them tell him a tale every night; and he kept that up till he had
hogged a thousand and one tales that way, and then he put them all in a
book, and called it Domesday Book--which was a good name and stated the
case.  You don't know kings, Jim, but I know them; and this old rip
of ourn is one of the cleanest I've struck in history.  Well, Henry he
takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country. How
does he go at it--give notice?--give the country a show?  No.  All of a
sudden he heaves all the tea in Boston Harbor overboard, and whacks
out a declaration of independence, and dares them to come on.  That was
_his_ style--he never give anybody a chance.  He had suspicions of his
father, the Duke of Wellington.  Well, what did he do?  Ask him to show
up?  No--drownded him in a butt of mamsey, like a cat.  S'pose people
left money laying around where he was--what did he do?  He collared it.
S'pose he contracted to do a thing, and you paid him, and didn't set
down there and see that he done it--what did he do?  He always done the
other thing. S'pose he opened his mouth--what then?  If he didn't shut it
up powerful quick he'd lose a lie every time.  That's the kind of a bug
Henry was; and if we'd a had him along 'stead of our kings he'd a fooled
that town a heap worse than ourn done.  I don't say that ourn is lambs,
because they ain't, when you come right down to the cold facts; but they
ain't nothing to _that_ old ram, anyway.  All I say is, kings is kings,
and you got to make allowances.  Take them all around, they're a mighty
ornery lot. It's the way they're raised.
But dis one do _smell_ so like de nation, Huck.
Well, they all do, Jim.  We can't help the way a king smells; history
don't tell no way.
Now de duke, he's a tolerble likely man in some ways.
Yes, a duke's different.  But not very different.  This one's
a middling hard lot for a duke.  When he's drunk there ain't no
near-sighted man could tell him from a king.
Well, anyways, I doan' hanker for no mo' un um, Huck.  Dese is all I
kin stan'.
It's the way I feel, too, Jim.  But we've got them on our hands, and we
got to remember what they are, and make allowances.  Sometimes I wish we
could hear of a country that's out of kings.
What was the use to tell Jim these warn't real kings and dukes?  It
wouldn't a done no good; and, besides, it was just as I said:  you
couldn't tell them from the real kind.
I went to sleep, and Jim didn't call me when it was my turn.  He often
done that.  When I waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with
his head down betwixt his knees, moaning and mourning to himself.  I
didn't take notice nor let on.  I knowed what it was about.  He was
thinking about his wife and his children, away up yonder, and he was low
and homesick; because he hadn't ever been away from home before in his
life; and I do believe he cared just as much for his people as white
folks does for their'n.  It don't seem natural, but I reckon it's so.
He was often moaning and mourning that way nights, when he judged I
was asleep, and saying, Po' little 'Lizabeth! po' little Johnny! it's
mighty hard; I spec' I ain't ever gwyne to see you no mo', no mo'!  He
was a mighty good nigger, Jim was.
But this time I somehow got to talking to him about his wife and young
ones; and by and by he says:
What makes me feel so bad dis time 'uz bekase I hear sumpn over yonder
on de bank like a whack, er a slam, while ago, en it mine me er de time
I treat my little 'Lizabeth so ornery.  She warn't on'y 'bout fo' year
ole, en she tuck de sk'yarlet fever, en had a powful rough spell; but
she got well, en one day she was a-stannin' aroun', en I says to her, I
says:
'Shet de do'.'
She never done it; jis' stood dah, kiner smilin' up at me.  It make me
mad; en I says agin, mighty loud, I says:
'Doan' you hear me?  Shet de do'!'
She jis stood de same way, kiner smilin' up.  I was a-bilin'!  I says:
'I lay I _make_ you mine!'
En wid dat I fetch' her a slap side de head dat sont her a-sprawlin'.
Den I went into de yuther room, en 'uz gone 'bout ten minutes; en when
I come back dah was dat do' a-stannin' open _yit_, en dat chile stannin'
mos' right in it, a-lookin' down and mournin', en de tears runnin' down.
My, but I _wuz_ mad!  I was a-gwyne for de chile, but jis' den--it was a
do' dat open innerds--jis' den, 'long come de wind en slam it to, behine

deef en dumb--en I'd ben a-treat'n her so!
CHAPTER XXIV.
NEXT day, towards night, we laid up under a little willow towhead out in
the middle, where there was a village on each side of the river, and the
duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns.  Jim
he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn't take but a few
hours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to
lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope.  You see, when we left him
all alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened on to him all
by himself and not tied it wouldn't look much like he was a runaway
nigger, you know. So the duke said it _was_ kind of hard to have to lay
roped all day, and he'd cipher out some way to get around it.
He was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it.  He dressed
Jim up in King Lear's outfit--it was a long curtain-calico gown, and a
white horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he took his theater paint
and painted Jim's face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead,
dull, solid blue, like a man that's been drownded nine days.  Blamed if
he warn't the horriblest looking outrage I ever see.  Then the duke took
and wrote out a sign on a shingle so:
Sick Arab--but harmless when not out of his head.
And he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or five
foot in front of the wigwam.  Jim was satisfied.  He said it was a sight
better than lying tied a couple of years every day, and trembling all
over every time there was a sound.  The duke told him to make himself
free and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, he must hop
out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like
a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone.
Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and he
wouldn't wait for him to howl.  Why, he didn't only look like he was
dead, he looked considerable more than that.
These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was
so much money in it, but they judged it wouldn't be safe, because maybe
the news might a worked along down by this time.  They couldn't hit no
project that suited exactly; so at last the duke said he reckoned he'd
lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldn't put up
something on the Arkansaw village; and the king he allowed he would drop
over to t'other village without any plan, but just trust in Providence
to lead him the profitable way--meaning the devil, I reckon.  We had all
bought store clothes where we stopped last; and now the king put his'n
on, and he told me to put mine on.  I done it, of course.  The king's
duds was all black, and he did look real swell and starchy.  I never
knowed how clothes could change a body before.  Why, before, he looked
like the orneriest old rip that ever was; but now, when he'd take off
his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile, he looked that grand
and good and pious that you'd say he had walked right out of the ark,
and maybe was old Leviticus himself.  Jim cleaned up the canoe, and I
got my paddle ready.  There was a big steamboat laying at the shore away
up under the point, about three mile above the town--been there a couple
of hours, taking on freight.  Says the king:
Seein' how I'm dressed, I reckon maybe I better arrive down from St.
Louis or Cincinnati, or some other big place.  Go for the steamboat,
Huckleberry; we'll come down to the village on her.
I didn't have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride.
I fetched the shore a half a mile above the village, and then went
scooting along the bluff bank in the easy water.  Pretty soon we come to
a nice innocent-looking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the
sweat off of his face, for it was powerful warm weather; and he had a
couple of big carpet-bags by him.
Run her nose in shore, says the king.  I done it.  Wher' you bound
for, young man?
For the steamboat; going to Orleans.
Git aboard, says the king.  Hold on a minute, my servant 'll he'p you
with them bags.  Jump out and he'p the gentleman, Adolphus--meaning me,
I see.
I done so, and then we all three started on again.  The young chap was
mighty thankful; said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather.
He asked the king where he was going, and the king told him he'd come
down the river and landed at the other village this morning, and now he
was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there.  The
young fellow says:
When I first see you I says to myself, 'It's Mr. Wilks, sure, and he
come mighty near getting here in time.'  But then I says again, 'No, I
reckon it ain't him, or else he wouldn't be paddling up the river.'  You
_ain't_ him, are you?
No, my name's Blodgett--Elexander Blodgett--_Reverend_ Elexander
Blodgett, I s'pose I must say, as I'm one o' the Lord's poor servants.
But still I'm jist as able to be sorry for Mr. Wilks for not arriving
in time, all the same, if he's missed anything by it--which I hope he
hasn't.
Well, he don't miss any property by it, because he'll get that all
right; but he's missed seeing his brother Peter die--which he mayn't
mind, nobody can tell as to that--but his brother would a give anything
in this world to see _him_ before he died; never talked about nothing
else all these three weeks; hadn't seen him since they was boys
together--and hadn't ever seen his brother William at all--that's the deef
and dumb one--William ain't more than thirty or thirty-five.  Peter and
George were the only ones that come out here; George was the married
brother; him and his wife both died last year.  Harvey and William's the
only ones that's left now; and, as I was saying, they haven't got here
in time.
Did anybody send 'em word?
Oh, yes; a month or two ago, when Peter was first took; because Peter
said then that he sorter felt like he warn't going to get well this
time. You see, he was pretty old, and George's g'yirls was too young to
be much company for him, except Mary Jane, the red-headed one; and so he
was kinder lonesome after George and his wife died, and didn't seem
to care much to live.  He most desperately wanted to see Harvey--and
William, too, for that matter--because he was one of them kind that can't
bear to make a will.  He left a letter behind for Harvey, and said he'd
told in it where his money was hid, and how he wanted the rest of the
property divided up so George's g'yirls would be all right--for George
didn't leave nothing.  And that letter was all they could get him to put
a pen to.
Why do you reckon Harvey don't come?  Wher' does he live?
Oh, he lives in England--Sheffield--preaches there--hasn't ever been in
this country.  He hasn't had any too much time--and besides he mightn't a
got the letter at all, you know.
Too bad, too bad he couldn't a lived to see his brothers, poor soul.
You going to Orleans, you say?
Yes, but that ain't only a part of it.  I'm going in a ship, next
Wednesday, for Ryo Janeero, where my uncle lives.
It's a pretty long journey.  But it'll be lovely; wisht I was a-going.
Is Mary Jane the oldest?  How old is the others?
Mary Jane's nineteen, Susan's fifteen, and Joanna's about
fourteen--that's the one that gives herself to good works and has a
hare-lip.
Poor things! to be left alone in the cold world so.
Well, they could be worse off.  Old Peter had friends, and they
ain't going to let them come to no harm.  There's Hobson, the Babtis'
preacher; and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford,
and Levi Bell, the lawyer; and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the
widow Bartley, and--well, there's a lot of them; but these are the ones
that Peter was thickest with, and used to write about sometimes, when
he wrote home; so Harvey 'll know where to look for friends when he gets
here.
Well, the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied
that young fellow.  Blamed if he didn't inquire about everybody and
everything in that blessed town, and all about the Wilkses; and about
Peter's business--which was a tanner; and about George's--which was a
carpenter; and about Harvey's--which was a dissentering minister; and so
on, and so on.  Then he says:
What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for?
Because she's a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn't stop
there.  When they're deep they won't stop for a hail.  A Cincinnati boat
will, but this is a St. Louis one.
Was Peter Wilks well off?
Oh, yes, pretty well off.  He had houses and land, and it's reckoned he
left three or four thousand in cash hid up som'ers.
When did you say he died?
I didn't say, but it was last night.
Funeral to-morrow, likely?
Yes, 'bout the middle of the day.
Well, it's all terrible sad; but we've all got to go, one time or
another. So what we want to do is to be prepared; then we're all right.
Yes, sir, it's the best way.  Ma used to always say that.
When we struck the boat she was about done loading, and pretty soon she
got off.  The king never said nothing about going aboard, so I lost
my ride, after all.  When the boat was gone the king made me paddle up
another mile to a lonesome place, and then he got ashore and says:
Now hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and the new
carpet-bags.  And if he's gone over to t'other side, go over there and
git him.  And tell him to git himself up regardless.  Shove along, now.
I see what _he_ was up to; but I never said nothing, of course.  When
I got back with the duke we hid the canoe, and then they set down on a
log, and the king told him everything, just like the young fellow had
said it--every last word of it.  And all the time he was a-doing it he
tried to talk like an Englishman; and he done it pretty well, too, for
a slouch. I can't imitate him, and so I ain't a-going to try to; but he
really done it pretty good.  Then he says:
How are you on the deef and dumb, Bilgewater?
The duke said, leave him alone for that; said he had played a deef
and dumb person on the histronic boards.  So then they waited for a
steamboat.
About the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along,
but they didn't come from high enough up the river; but at last there
was a big one, and they hailed her.  She sent out her yawl, and we went
aboard, and she was from Cincinnati; and when they found we only wanted
to go four or five mile they was booming mad, and gave us a cussing, and
said they wouldn't land us.  But the king was ca'm.  He says:
If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and
put off in a yawl, a steamboat kin afford to carry 'em, can't it?
So they softened down and said it was all right; and when we got to the
village they yawled us ashore.  About two dozen men flocked down when
they see the yawl a-coming, and when the king says:
Kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher' Mr. Peter Wilks lives? they
give a glance at one another, and nodded their heads, as much as to say,
What d' I tell you?  Then one of them says, kind of soft and gentle:
I'm sorry sir, but the best we can do is to tell you where he _did_
live yesterday evening.
Sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash, and fell up
against the man, and put his chin on his shoulder, and cried down his
back, and says:
Alas, alas, our poor brother--gone, and we never got to see him; oh,
it's too, too hard!
Then he turns around, blubbering, and makes a lot of idiotic signs to
the duke on his hands, and blamed if he didn't drop a carpet-bag and
bust out a-crying.  If they warn't the beatenest lot, them two frauds,
that ever I struck.
Well, the men gathered around and sympathized with them, and said all
sorts of kind things to them, and carried their carpet-bags up the hill
for them, and let them lean on them and cry, and told the king all about
his brother's last moments, and the king he told it all over again on
his hands to the duke, and both of them took on about that dead tanner
like they'd lost the twelve disciples.  Well, if ever I struck anything
like it, I'm a nigger. It was enough to make a body ashamed of the human
race.
CHAPTER XXV.
THE news was all over town in two minutes, and you could see the people
tearing down on the run from every which way, some of them putting on
their coats as they come.  Pretty soon we was in the middle of a crowd,
and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march.  The windows and
dooryards was full; and every minute somebody would say, over a fence:
Is it _them_?
And somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say:
You bet it is.
When we got to the house the street in front of it was packed, and the
three girls was standing in the door.  Mary Jane _was_ red-headed, but
that don't make no difference, she was most awful beautiful, and her
face and her eyes was all lit up like glory, she was so glad her uncles
was come. The king he spread his arms, and Mary Jane she jumped for
them, and the hare-lip jumped for the duke, and there they had it!
Everybody most, leastways women, cried for joy to see them meet again
at last and have such good times.
Then the king he hunched the duke private--I see him do it--and then he
looked around and see the coffin, over in the corner on two chairs; so
then him and the duke, with a hand across each other's shoulder, and
t'other hand to their eyes, walked slow and solemn over there, everybody
dropping back to give them room, and all the talk and noise stopping,
people saying Sh! and all the men taking their hats off and drooping
their heads, so you could a heard a pin fall.  And when they got there
they bent over and looked in the coffin, and took one sight, and then
they bust out a-crying so you could a heard them to Orleans, most; and
then they put their arms around each other's necks, and hung their chins
over each other's shoulders; and then for three minutes, or maybe four,
I never see two men leak the way they done.  And, mind you, everybody
was doing the same; and the place was that damp I never see anything
like it. Then one of them got on one side of the coffin, and t'other on
t'other side, and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads on the
coffin, and let on to pray all to themselves.  Well, when it come
to that it worked the crowd like you never see anything like it, and
everybody broke down and went to sobbing right out loud--the poor girls,
too; and every woman, nearly, went up to the girls, without saying a
word, and kissed them, solemn, on the forehead, and then put their hand
on their head, and looked up towards the sky, with the tears running
down, and then busted out and went off sobbing and swabbing, and give
the next woman a show.  I never see anything so disgusting.
Well, by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little, and
works himself up and slobbers out a speech, all full of tears and
flapdoodle about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brother
to lose the diseased, and to miss seeing diseased alive after the long
journey of four thousand mile, but it's a trial that's sweetened and
sanctified to us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears, and so he
thanks them out of his heart and out of his brother's heart, because out
of their mouths they can't, words being too weak and cold, and all that
kind of rot and slush, till it was just sickening; and then he blubbers
out a pious goody-goody Amen, and turns himself loose and goes to crying
fit to bust.
And the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the
crowd struck up the doxolojer, and everybody joined in with all their
might, and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church
letting out. Music is a good thing; and after all that soul-butter and
hogwash I never see it freshen up things so, and sound so honest and
bully.
Then the king begins to work his jaw again, and says how him and his
nieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the
family would take supper here with them this evening, and help set up
with the ashes of the diseased; and says if his poor brother laying
yonder could speak he knows who he would name, for they was names that
was very dear to him, and mentioned often in his letters; and so he will
name the same, to wit, as follows, vizz.:--Rev. Mr. Hobson, and Deacon
Lot Hovey, and Mr. Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, and
Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley.
Rev. Hobson and Dr. Robinson was down to the end of the town a-hunting
together--that is, I mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to t'other
world, and the preacher was pinting him right.  Lawyer Bell was away up
to Louisville on business.  But the rest was on hand, and so they all
come and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked to him;
and then they shook hands with the duke and didn't say nothing, but just
kept a-smiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads whilst
he made all sorts of signs with his hands and said Goo-goo--goo-goo-goo
all the time, like a baby that can't talk.
So the king he blattered along, and managed to inquire about pretty
much everybody and dog in town, by his name, and mentioned all sorts
of little things that happened one time or another in the town, or to
George's family, or to Peter.  And he always let on that Peter wrote him
the things; but that was a lie:  he got every blessed one of them out of
that young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat.
Then Mary Jane she fetched the letter her father left behind, and the
king he read it out loud and cried over it.  It give the dwelling-house
and three thousand dollars, gold, to the girls; and it give the tanyard
(which was doing a good business), along with some other houses and
land (worth about seven thousand), and three thousand dollars in gold
to Harvey and William, and told where the six thousand cash was hid down
cellar.  So these two frauds said they'd go and fetch it up, and have
everything square and above-board; and told me to come with a candle.
We shut the cellar door behind us, and when they found the bag
they spilt it out on the floor, and it was a lovely sight, all them
yaller-boys.  My, the way the king's eyes did shine!  He slaps the duke
on the shoulder and says:
Oh, _this_ ain't bully nor noth'n!  Oh, no, I reckon not!  Why,
_bully_, it beats the Nonesuch, _don't_ it?
The duke allowed it did.  They pawed the yaller-boys, and sifted them
through their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor; and the
king says:
It ain't no use talkin'; bein' brothers to a rich dead man and
representatives of furrin heirs that's got left is the line for you and
me, Bilge.  Thish yer comes of trust'n to Providence.  It's the best
way, in the long run.  I've tried 'em all, and ther' ain't no better
way.
Most everybody would a been satisfied with the pile, and took it on
trust; but no, they must count it.  So they counts it, and it comes out
four hundred and fifteen dollars short.  Says the king:
Dern him, I wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteen
dollars?
They worried over that awhile, and ransacked all around for it.  Then
the duke says:
Well, he was a pretty sick man, and likely he made a mistake--I reckon
that's the way of it.  The best way's to let it go, and keep still about
it.  We can spare it.
Oh, shucks, yes, we can _spare_ it.  I don't k'yer noth'n 'bout
that--it's the _count_ I'm thinkin' about.  We want to be awful square
and open and above-board here, you know.  We want to lug this h-yer
money up stairs and count it before everybody--then ther' ain't noth'n
suspicious.  But when the dead man says ther's six thous'n dollars, you
know, we don't want to--
Hold on, says the duke.  Le's make up the deffisit, and he begun to
haul out yaller-boys out of his pocket.
It's a most amaz'n' good idea, duke--you _have_ got a rattlin' clever
head on you, says the king.  Blest if the old Nonesuch ain't a heppin'
us out agin, and _he_ begun to haul out yaller-jackets and stack them
up.
It most busted them, but they made up the six thousand clean and clear.
Say, says the duke, I got another idea.  Le's go up stairs and count
this money, and then take and _give it to the girls_.
Good land, duke, lemme hug you!  It's the most dazzling idea 'at ever a
man struck.  You have cert'nly got the most astonishin' head I ever see.
Oh, this is the boss dodge, ther' ain't no mistake 'bout it.  Let 'em
fetch along their suspicions now if they want to--this 'll lay 'em out.
When we got up-stairs everybody gethered around the table, and the king
he counted it and stacked it up, three hundred dollars in a pile--twenty
elegant little piles.  Everybody looked hungry at it, and licked their
chops.  Then they raked it into the bag again, and I see the king begin
to swell himself up for another speech.  He says:
Friends all, my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous by
them that's left behind in the vale of sorrers.  He has done generous by
these yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered, and that's left
fatherless and motherless.  Yes, and we that knowed him knows that he
would a done _more_ generous by 'em if he hadn't ben afeard o' woundin'
his dear William and me.  Now, _wouldn't_ he?  Ther' ain't no question
'bout it in _my_ mind.  Well, then, what kind o' brothers would it be
that 'd stand in his way at sech a time?  And what kind o' uncles would
it be that 'd rob--yes, _rob_--sech poor sweet lambs as these 'at he loved
so at sech a time?  If I know William--and I _think_ I do--he--well, I'll
jest ask him. He turns around and begins to make a lot of signs to
the duke with his hands, and the duke he looks at him stupid and
leather-headed a while; then all of a sudden he seems to catch his
meaning, and jumps for the king, goo-gooing with all his might for joy,
and hugs him about fifteen times before he lets up.  Then the king says,
I knowed it; I reckon _that 'll_ convince anybody the way _he_ feels
about it.  Here, Mary Jane, Susan, Joanner, take the money--take it
_all_.  It's the gift of him that lays yonder, cold but joyful.
Mary Jane she went for him, Susan and the hare-lip went for the
duke, and then such another hugging and kissing I never see yet.  And
everybody crowded up with the tears in their eyes, and most shook the
hands off of them frauds, saying all the time:
You _dear_ good souls!--how _lovely_!--how _could_ you!
Well, then, pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased
again, and how good he was, and what a loss he was, and all that; and
before long a big iron-jawed man worked himself in there from outside,
and stood a-listening and looking, and not saying anything; and nobody
saying anything to him either, because the king was talking and they was
all busy listening.  The king was saying--in the middle of something he'd
started in on--
--they bein' partickler friends o' the diseased.  That's why they're
invited here this evenin'; but tomorrow we want _all_ to come--everybody;
for he respected everybody, he liked everybody, and so it's fitten that
his funeral orgies sh'd be public.
And so he went a-mooning on and on, liking to hear himself talk, and
every little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again, till the duke
he couldn't stand it no more; so he writes on a little scrap of paper,
_Obsequies_, you old fool, and folds it up, and goes to goo-gooing and
reaching it over people's heads to him.  The king he reads it and puts
it in his pocket, and says:
Poor William, afflicted as he is, his _heart's_ aluz right.  Asks me
to invite everybody to come to the funeral--wants me to make 'em all
welcome.  But he needn't a worried--it was jest what I was at.
Then he weaves along again, perfectly ca'm, and goes to dropping in his
funeral orgies again every now and then, just like he done before.  And
when he done it the third time he says:
I say orgies, not because it's the common term, because it
ain't--obsequies bein' the common term--but because orgies is the right
term. Obsequies ain't used in England no more now--it's gone out.  We
say orgies now in England.  Orgies is better, because it means the thing
you're after more exact.  It's a word that's made up out'n the Greek
_orgo_, outside, open, abroad; and the Hebrew _jeesum_, to plant, cover
up; hence in_ter._  So, you see, funeral orgies is an open er public
funeral.
He was the _worst_ I ever struck.  Well, the iron-jawed man he laughed
right in his face.  Everybody was shocked.  Everybody says, Why,
_doctor_! and Abner Shackleford says:
Why, Robinson, hain't you heard the news?  This is Harvey Wilks.
The king he smiled eager, and shoved out his flapper, and says:
Is it my poor brother's dear good friend and physician?  I--
Keep your hands off of me! says the doctor.  _You_ talk like an
Englishman, _don't_ you?  It's the worst imitation I ever heard.  _You_
Peter Wilks's brother!  You're a fraud, that's what you are!
Well, how they all took on!  They crowded around the doctor and tried to
quiet him down, and tried to explain to him and tell him how Harvey 'd
showed in forty ways that he _was_ Harvey, and knowed everybody by name,
and the names of the very dogs, and begged and _begged_ him not to hurt
Harvey's feelings and the poor girl's feelings, and all that.  But it
warn't no use; he stormed right along, and said any man that pretended
to be an Englishman and couldn't imitate the lingo no better than what
he did was a fraud and a liar.  The poor girls was hanging to the king
and crying; and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on _them_.  He
says:
I was your father's friend, and I'm your friend; and I warn you as a
friend, and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out of
harm and trouble, to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have nothing
to do with him, the ignorant tramp, with his idiotic Greek and Hebrew,
as he calls it.  He is the thinnest kind of an impostor--has come here
with a lot of empty names and facts which he picked up somewheres, and
you take them for _proofs_, and are helped to fool yourselves by these
foolish friends here, who ought to know better.  Mary Jane Wilks, you
know me for your friend, and for your unselfish friend, too.  Now listen
to me; turn this pitiful rascal out--I _beg_ you to do it.  Will you?
Mary Jane straightened herself up, and my, but she was handsome!  She
says:
_Here_ is my answer.  She hove up the bag of money and put it in the
king's hands, and says, Take this six thousand dollars, and invest for
me and my sisters any way you want to, and don't give us no receipt for
it.
Then she put her arm around the king on one side, and Susan and the
hare-lip done the same on the other.  Everybody clapped their hands and
stomped on the floor like a perfect storm, whilst the king held up his
head and smiled proud.  The doctor says:
All right; I wash _my_ hands of the matter.  But I warn you all that a
time 's coming when you're going to feel sick whenever you think of this
day. And away he went.
All right, doctor, says the king, kinder mocking him; we'll try and
get 'em to send for you; which made them all laugh, and they said it
was a prime good hit.
CHAPTER XXVI.
WELL, when they was all gone the king he asks Mary Jane how they was off
for spare rooms, and she said she had one spare room, which would do for
Uncle William, and she'd give her own room to Uncle Harvey, which was
a little bigger, and she would turn into the room with her sisters and
sleep on a cot; and up garret was a little cubby, with a pallet in it.
The king said the cubby would do for his valley--meaning me.
So Mary Jane took us up, and she showed them their rooms, which was
plain but nice.  She said she'd have her frocks and a lot of other traps
took out of her room if they was in Uncle Harvey's way, but he said
they warn't.  The frocks was hung along the wall, and before them was
a curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor.  There was an
old hair trunk in one corner, and a guitar-box in another, and all sorts
of little knickknacks and jimcracks around, like girls brisken up a room
with.  The king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter for
these fixings, and so don't disturb them.  The duke's room was pretty
small, but plenty good enough, and so was my cubby.
That night they had a big supper, and all them men and women was there,
and I stood behind the king and the duke's chairs and waited on them,
and the niggers waited on the rest.  Mary Jane she set at the head of
the table, with Susan alongside of her, and said how bad the biscuits
was, and how mean the preserves was, and how ornery and tough the fried
chickens was--and all that kind of rot, the way women always do for to
force out compliments; and the people all knowed everything was tiptop,
and said so--said How _do_ you get biscuits to brown so nice? and
Where, for the land's sake, _did_ you get these amaz'n pickles? and
all that kind of humbug talky-talk, just the way people always does at a
supper, you know.
And when it was all done me and the hare-lip had supper in the kitchen
off of the leavings, whilst the others was helping the niggers clean up
the things.  The hare-lip she got to pumping me about England, and blest
if I didn't think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes.  She says:
Did you ever see the king?
Who?  William Fourth?  Well, I bet I have--he goes to our church.  I
knowed he was dead years ago, but I never let on.  So when I says he
goes to our church, she says:
What--regular?
Yes--regular.  His pew's right over opposite ourn--on t'other side the
pulpit.
I thought he lived in London?
Well, he does.  Where _would_ he live?
But I thought _you_ lived in Sheffield?
I see I was up a stump.  I had to let on to get choked with a chicken
bone, so as to get time to think how to get down again.  Then I says:
I mean he goes to our church regular when he's in Sheffield.  That's
only in the summer time, when he comes there to take the sea baths.
Why, how you talk--Sheffield ain't on the sea.
Well, who said it was?
Why, you did.
I _didn't_ nuther.
You did!
I didn't.
You did.
I never said nothing of the kind.
Well, what _did_ you say, then?
Said he come to take the sea _baths_--that's what I said.
Well, then, how's he going to take the sea baths if it ain't on the
sea?
Looky here, I says; did you ever see any Congress-water?
Yes.
Well, did you have to go to Congress to get it?
Why, no.
Well, neither does William Fourth have to go to the sea to get a sea
bath.
How does he get it, then?
Gets it the way people down here gets Congress-water--in barrels.  There
in the palace at Sheffield they've got furnaces, and he wants his water
hot.  They can't bile that amount of water away off there at the sea.
They haven't got no conveniences for it.
Oh, I see, now.  You might a said that in the first place and saved
time.
When she said that I see I was out of the woods again, and so I was
comfortable and glad.  Next, she says:
Do you go to church, too?
Yes--regular.
Where do you set?
Why, in our pew.
_Whose_ pew?
Why, _ourn_--your Uncle Harvey's.
His'n?  What does _he_ want with a pew?
Wants it to set in.  What did you _reckon_ he wanted with it?
Why, I thought he'd be in the pulpit.
Rot him, I forgot he was a preacher.  I see I was up a stump again, so I
played another chicken bone and got another think.  Then I says:
Blame it, do you suppose there ain't but one preacher to a church?
Why, what do they want with more?
What!--to preach before a king?  I never did see such a girl as you.
They don't have no less than seventeen.
Seventeen!  My land!  Why, I wouldn't set out such a string as that,
not if I _never_ got to glory.  It must take 'em a week.
Shucks, they don't _all_ of 'em preach the same day--only _one_ of 'em.
Well, then, what does the rest of 'em do?
Oh, nothing much.  Loll around, pass the plate--and one thing or
another.  But mainly they don't do nothing.
Well, then, what are they _for_?
Why, they're for _style_.  Don't you know nothing?
Well, I don't _want_ to know no such foolishness as that.  How is
servants treated in England?  Do they treat 'em better 'n we treat our
niggers?
_No_!  A servant ain't nobody there.  They treat them worse than dogs.
Don't they give 'em holidays, the way we do, Christmas and New Year's
week, and Fourth of July?
Oh, just listen!  A body could tell _you_ hain't ever been to England
by that.  Why, Hare-l--why, Joanna, they never see a holiday from year's
end to year's end; never go to the circus, nor theater, nor nigger
shows, nor nowheres.
Nor church?
Nor church.
But _you_ always went to church.
Well, I was gone up again.  I forgot I was the old man's servant.  But
next minute I whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley was
different from a common servant and _had_ to go to church whether he
wanted to or not, and set with the family, on account of its being the
law.  But I didn't do it pretty good, and when I got done I see she
warn't satisfied.  She says:
Honest injun, now, hain't you been telling me a lot of lies?
Honest injun, says I.
None of it at all?
None of it at all.  Not a lie in it, says I.
Lay your hand on this book and say it.
I see it warn't nothing but a dictionary, so I laid my hand on it and
said it.  So then she looked a little better satisfied, and says:
Well, then, I'll believe some of it; but I hope to gracious if I'll
believe the rest.
What is it you won't believe, Joe? says Mary Jane, stepping in with
Susan behind her.  It ain't right nor kind for you to talk so to him,
and him a stranger and so far from his people.  How would you like to be
treated so?
That's always your way, Maim--always sailing in to help somebody before
they're hurt.  I hain't done nothing to him.  He's told some stretchers,
I reckon, and I said I wouldn't swallow it all; and that's every bit
and grain I _did_ say.  I reckon he can stand a little thing like that,
can't he?
I don't care whether 'twas little or whether 'twas big; he's here in
our house and a stranger, and it wasn't good of you to say it.  If you
was in his place it would make you feel ashamed; and so you oughtn't to
say a thing to another person that will make _them_ feel ashamed.
Why, Mam, he said--
It don't make no difference what he _said_--that ain't the thing.  The
thing is for you to treat him _kind_, and not be saying things to make
him remember he ain't in his own country and amongst his own folks.
I says to myself, _this_ is a girl that I'm letting that old reptile rob
her of her money!
Then Susan _she_ waltzed in; and if you'll believe me, she did give
Hare-lip hark from the tomb!
Says I to myself, and this is _another_ one that I'm letting him rob her
of her money!
Then Mary Jane she took another inning, and went in sweet and lovely
again--which was her way; but when she got done there warn't hardly
anything left o' poor Hare-lip.  So she hollered.
All right, then, says the other girls; you just ask his pardon.
She done it, too; and she done it beautiful.  She done it so beautiful
it was good to hear; and I wished I could tell her a thousand lies, so
she could do it again.
I says to myself, this is _another_ one that I'm letting him rob her of
her money.  And when she got through they all jest laid theirselves
out to make me feel at home and know I was amongst friends.  I felt so
ornery and low down and mean that I says to myself, my mind's made up;
I'll hive that money for them or bust.
So then I lit out--for bed, I said, meaning some time or another.  When
I got by myself I went to thinking the thing over.  I says to myself,
shall I go to that doctor, private, and blow on these frauds?  No--that
won't do. He might tell who told him; then the king and the duke would
make it warm for me.  Shall I go, private, and tell Mary Jane?  No--I
dasn't do it. Her face would give them a hint, sure; they've got the
money, and they'd slide right out and get away with it.  If she was to
fetch in help I'd get mixed up in the business before it was done with,
I judge.  No; there ain't no good way but one.  I got to steal that
money, somehow; and I got to steal it some way that they won't suspicion
that I done it. They've got a good thing here, and they ain't a-going
to leave till they've played this family and this town for all they're
worth, so I'll find a chance time enough. I'll steal it and hide it; and
by and by, when I'm away down the river, I'll write a letter and tell
Mary Jane where it's hid.  But I better hive it tonight if I can,
because the doctor maybe hasn't let up as much as he lets on he has; he
might scare them out of here yet.
So, thinks I, I'll go and search them rooms.  Upstairs the hall was
dark, but I found the duke's room, and started to paw around it with
my hands; but I recollected it wouldn't be much like the king to let
anybody else take care of that money but his own self; so then I went to
his room and begun to paw around there.  But I see I couldn't do nothing
without a candle, and I dasn't light one, of course.  So I judged I'd
got to do the other thing--lay for them and eavesdrop.  About that time
I hears their footsteps coming, and was going to skip under the bed; I
reached for it, but it wasn't where I thought it would be; but I touched
the curtain that hid Mary Jane's frocks, so I jumped in behind that and
snuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood there perfectly still.
They come in and shut the door; and the first thing the duke done was to
get down and look under the bed.  Then I was glad I hadn't found the bed
when I wanted it.  And yet, you know, it's kind of natural to hide under
the bed when you are up to anything private.  They sets down then, and
the king says:
Well, what is it?  And cut it middlin' short, because it's better for
us to be down there a-whoopin' up the mournin' than up here givin' 'em a
chance to talk us over.
Well, this is it, Capet.  I ain't easy; I ain't comfortable.  That
doctor lays on my mind.  I wanted to know your plans.  I've got a
notion, and I think it's a sound one.
What is it, duke?
That we better glide out of this before three in the morning, and clip
it down the river with what we've got.  Specially, seeing we got it so
easy--_given_ back to us, flung at our heads, as you may say, when of
course we allowed to have to steal it back.  I'm for knocking off and
lighting out.
That made me feel pretty bad.  About an hour or two ago it would a been
a little different, but now it made me feel bad and disappointed, The
king rips out and says:
What!  And not sell out the rest o' the property?  March off like
a passel of fools and leave eight or nine thous'n' dollars' worth o'
property layin' around jest sufferin' to be scooped in?--and all good,
salable stuff, too.
The duke he grumbled; said the bag of gold was enough, and he didn't
want to go no deeper--didn't want to rob a lot of orphans of _everything_
they had.
Why, how you talk! says the king.  We sha'n't rob 'em of nothing at
all but jest this money.  The people that _buys_ the property is the
suff'rers; because as soon 's it's found out 'at we didn't own it--which
won't be long after we've slid--the sale won't be valid, and it 'll all
go back to the estate.  These yer orphans 'll git their house back agin,
and that's enough for _them_; they're young and spry, and k'n easy
earn a livin'.  _they_ ain't a-goin to suffer.  Why, jest think--there's
thous'n's and thous'n's that ain't nigh so well off.  Bless you, _they_
ain't got noth'n' to complain of.
Well, the king he talked him blind; so at last he give in, and said all
right, but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay, and that
doctor hanging over them.  But the king says:
Cuss the doctor!  What do we k'yer for _him_?  Hain't we got all the
fools in town on our side?  And ain't that a big enough majority in any
town?
So they got ready to go down stairs again.  The duke says:
I don't think we put that money in a good place.
That cheered me up.  I'd begun to think I warn't going to get a hint of
no kind to help me.  The king says:
Why?
Because Mary Jane 'll be in mourning from this out; and first you know
the nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds
up and put 'em away; and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and
not borrow some of it?
Your head's level agin, duke, says the king; and he comes a-fumbling
under the curtain two or three foot from where I was.  I stuck tight to
the wall and kept mighty still, though quivery; and I wondered what them
fellows would say to me if they catched me; and I tried to think what
I'd better do if they did catch me.  But the king he got the bag before
I could think more than about a half a thought, and he never suspicioned
I was around.  They took and shoved the bag through a rip in the straw
tick that was under the feather-bed, and crammed it in a foot or two
amongst the straw and said it was all right now, because a nigger only
makes up the feather-bed, and don't turn over the straw tick only about
twice a year, and so it warn't in no danger of getting stole now.
But I knowed better.  I had it out of there before they was half-way
down stairs.  I groped along up to my cubby, and hid it there till I
could get a chance to do better.  I judged I better hide it outside
of the house somewheres, because if they missed it they would give the
house a good ransacking:  I knowed that very well.  Then I turned in,
with my clothes all on; but I couldn't a gone to sleep if I'd a wanted
to, I was in such a sweat to get through with the business.  By and by I
heard the king and the duke come up; so I rolled off my pallet and laid
with my chin at the top of my ladder, and waited to see if anything was
going to happen.  But nothing did.
So I held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadn't
begun yet; and then I slipped down the ladder.
CHAPTER XXVII.
I crept to their doors and listened; they was snoring.  So I tiptoed
along, and got down stairs all right.  There warn't a sound anywheres.
I peeped through a crack of the dining-room door, and see the men that
was watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs.  The door
was open into the parlor, where the corpse was laying, and there was a
candle in both rooms. I passed along, and the parlor door was open; but
I see there warn't nobody in there but the remainders of Peter; so I
shoved on by; but the front door was locked, and the key wasn't there.
Just then I heard somebody coming down the stairs, back behind me.  I
run in the parlor and took a swift look around, and the only place I
see to hide the bag was in the coffin.  The lid was shoved along about
a foot, showing the dead man's face down in there, with a wet cloth over
it, and his shroud on.  I tucked the money-bag in under the lid, just
down beyond where his hands was crossed, which made me creep, they was
so cold, and then I run back across the room and in behind the door.
The person coming was Mary Jane.  She went to the coffin, very soft, and
kneeled down and looked in; then she put up her handkerchief, and I see
she begun to cry, though I couldn't hear her, and her back was to me.  I
slid out, and as I passed the dining-room I thought I'd make sure them
watchers hadn't seen me; so I looked through the crack, and everything
was all right.  They hadn't stirred.
I slipped up to bed, feeling ruther blue, on accounts of the thing
playing out that way after I had took so much trouble and run so much
resk about it.  Says I, if it could stay where it is, all right; because
when we get down the river a hundred mile or two I could write back to
Mary Jane, and she could dig him up again and get it; but that ain't the
thing that's going to happen; the thing that's going to happen is, the
money 'll be found when they come to screw on the lid.  Then the king
'll get it again, and it 'll be a long day before he gives anybody
another chance to smouch it from him. Of course I _wanted_ to slide
down and get it out of there, but I dasn't try it.  Every minute it was
getting earlier now, and pretty soon some of them watchers would begin
to stir, and I might get catched--catched with six thousand dollars in my
hands that nobody hadn't hired me to take care of.  I don't wish to be
mixed up in no such business as that, I says to myself.
When I got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up, and the
watchers was gone.  There warn't nobody around but the family and the
widow Bartley and our tribe.  I watched their faces to see if anything
had been happening, but I couldn't tell.
Towards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man, and they
set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs, and then
set all our chairs in rows, and borrowed more from the neighbors till
the hall and the parlor and the dining-room was full.  I see the coffin
lid was the way it was before, but I dasn't go to look in under it, with
folks around.
Then the people begun to flock in, and the beats and the girls took
seats in the front row at the head of the coffin, and for a half an hour
the people filed around slow, in single rank, and looked down at the
dead man's face a minute, and some dropped in a tear, and it was
all very still and solemn, only the girls and the beats holding
handkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads bent, and sobbing a
little.  There warn't no other sound but the scraping of the feet on
the floor and blowing noses--because people always blows them more at a
funeral than they do at other places except church.
When the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his
black gloves with his softy soothering ways, putting on the last
touches, and getting people and things all ship-shape and comfortable,
and making no more sound than a cat.  He never spoke; he moved people
around, he squeezed in late ones, he opened up passageways, and done
it with nods, and signs with his hands.  Then he took his place over
against the wall. He was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest man I ever
see; and there warn't no more smile to him than there is to a ham.
They had borrowed a melodeum--a sick one; and when everything was ready
a young woman set down and worked it, and it was pretty skreeky and
colicky, and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter was the only one
that had a good thing, according to my notion.  Then the Reverend Hobson
opened up, slow and solemn, and begun to talk; and straight off the most
outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard; it was only
one dog, but he made a most powerful racket, and he kept it up right
along; the parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait--you
couldn't hear yourself think.  It was right down awkward, and nobody
didn't seem to know what to do.  But pretty soon they see that
long-legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say,
Don't you worry--just depend on me.  Then he stooped down and begun
to glide along the wall, just his shoulders showing over the people's
heads.  So he glided along, and the powwow and racket getting more and
more outrageous all the time; and at last, when he had gone around two
sides of the room, he disappears down cellar.  Then in about two seconds
we heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or
two, and then everything was dead still, and the parson begun his solemn
talk where he left off.  In a minute or two here comes this undertaker's
back and shoulders gliding along the wall again; and so he glided and
glided around three sides of the room, and then rose up, and shaded his
mouth with his hands, and stretched his neck out towards the preacher,
over the people's heads, and says, in a kind of a coarse whisper, _He
had a rat_!  Then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to
his place.  You could see it was a great satisfaction to the people,
because naturally they wanted to know.  A little thing like that don't
cost nothing, and it's just the little things that makes a man to be
looked up to and liked.  There warn't no more popular man in town than
what that undertaker was.
Well, the funeral sermon was very good, but pison long and tiresome; and
then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage, and
at last the job was through, and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the
coffin with his screw-driver.  I was in a sweat then, and watched him
pretty keen. But he never meddled at all; just slid the lid along as
soft as mush, and screwed it down tight and fast.  So there I was!  I
didn't know whether the money was in there or not.  So, says I, s'pose
somebody has hogged that bag on the sly?--now how do I know whether
to write to Mary Jane or not? S'pose she dug him up and didn't find
nothing, what would she think of me? Blame it, I says, I might get
hunted up and jailed; I'd better lay low and keep dark, and not write at
all; the thing's awful mixed now; trying to better it, I've worsened it
a hundred times, and I wish to goodness I'd just let it alone, dad fetch
the whole business!
They buried him, and we come back home, and I went to watching faces
again--I couldn't help it, and I couldn't rest easy.  But nothing come of
it; the faces didn't tell me nothing.
The king he visited around in the evening, and sweetened everybody up,
and made himself ever so friendly; and he give out the idea that his
congregation over in England would be in a sweat about him, so he must
hurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home.  He was
very sorry he was so pushed, and so was everybody; they wished he could
stay longer, but they said they could see it couldn't be done.  And he
said of course him and William would take the girls home with them; and
that pleased everybody too, because then the girls would be well fixed
and amongst their own relations; and it pleased the girls, too--tickled
them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world; and told
him to sell out as quick as he wanted to, they would be ready.  Them
poor things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them
getting fooled and lied to so, but I didn't see no safe way for me to
chip in and change the general tune.
Well, blamed if the king didn't bill the house and the niggers and all
the property for auction straight off--sale two days after the funeral;
but anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to.
So the next day after the funeral, along about noon-time, the girls' joy
got the first jolt.  A couple of nigger traders come along, and the king
sold them the niggers reasonable, for three-day drafts as they called
it, and away they went, the two sons up the river to Memphis, and their
mother down the river to Orleans.  I thought them poor girls and them
niggers would break their hearts for grief; they cried around each
other, and took on so it most made me down sick to see it.  The girls
said they hadn't ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold
away from the town.  I can't ever get it out of my memory, the sight of
them poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each other's necks
and crying; and I reckon I couldn't a stood it all, but would a had
to bust out and tell on our gang if I hadn't knowed the sale warn't no
account and the niggers would be back home in a week or two.
The thing made a big stir in the town, too, and a good many come out
flatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the
children that way.  It injured the frauds some; but the old fool he
bulled right along, spite of all the duke could say or do, and I tell
you the duke was powerful uneasy.
Next day was auction day.  About broad day in the morning the king and
the duke come up in the garret and woke me up, and I see by their look
that there was trouble.  The king says:
Was you in my room night before last?
No, your majesty--which was the way I always called him when nobody but
our gang warn't around.
Was you in there yisterday er last night?
No, your majesty.
Honor bright, now--no lies.
Honor bright, your majesty, I'm telling you the truth.  I hain't been
a-near your room since Miss Mary Jane took you and the duke and showed
it to you.
The duke says:
Have you seen anybody else go in there?
No, your grace, not as I remember, I believe.
Stop and think.
I studied awhile and see my chance; then I says:
Well, I see the niggers go in there several times.
Both of them gave a little jump, and looked like they hadn't ever
expected it, and then like they _had_.  Then the duke says:
What, all of them?
No--leastways, not all at once--that is, I don't think I ever see them
all come _out_ at once but just one time.
Hello!  When was that?
It was the day we had the funeral.  In the morning.  It warn't early,
because I overslept.  I was just starting down the ladder, and I see
them.
Well, go on, _go_ on!  What did they do?  How'd they act?
They didn't do nothing.  And they didn't act anyway much, as fur as I
see. They tiptoed away; so I seen, easy enough, that they'd shoved in
there to do up your majesty's room, or something, s'posing you was up;
and found you _warn't_ up, and so they was hoping to slide out of the
way of trouble without waking you up, if they hadn't already waked you
up.
Great guns, _this_ is a go! says the king; and both of them looked
pretty sick and tolerable silly.  They stood there a-thinking and
scratching their heads a minute, and the duke he bust into a kind of a
little raspy chuckle, and says:
It does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand.  They let on
to be _sorry_ they was going out of this region!  And I believed they
_was_ sorry, and so did you, and so did everybody.  Don't ever tell _me_
any more that a nigger ain't got any histrionic talent.  Why, the way
they played that thing it would fool _anybody_.  In my opinion, there's
a fortune in 'em.  If I had capital and a theater, I wouldn't want a
better lay-out than that--and here we've gone and sold 'em for a song.
Yes, and ain't privileged to sing the song yet.  Say, where _is_ that
song--that draft?
In the bank for to be collected.  Where _would_ it be?
Well, _that's_ all right then, thank goodness.
Says I, kind of timid-like:
Is something gone wrong?
The king whirls on me and rips out:
None o' your business!  You keep your head shet, and mind y'r own
affairs--if you got any.  Long as you're in this town don't you forgit
_that_--you hear?  Then he says to the duke, We got to jest swaller it
and say noth'n':  mum's the word for _us_.
As they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again, and
says:
Quick sales _and_ small profits!  It's a good business--yes.
The king snarls around on him and says:
I was trying to do for the best in sellin' 'em out so quick.  If the
profits has turned out to be none, lackin' considable, and none to
carry, is it my fault any more'n it's yourn?
Well, _they'd_ be in this house yet and we _wouldn't_ if I could a got
my advice listened to.
The king sassed back as much as was safe for him, and then swapped
around and lit into _me_ again.  He give me down the banks for not
coming and _telling_ him I see the niggers come out of his room acting
that way--said any fool would a _knowed_ something was up.  And then
waltzed in and cussed _himself_ awhile, and said it all come of him not
laying late and taking his natural rest that morning, and he'd be
blamed if he'd ever do it again.  So they went off a-jawing; and I felt
dreadful glad I'd worked it all off on to the niggers, and yet hadn't
done the niggers no harm by it.
CHAPTER XXVIII.
BY and by it was getting-up time.  So I come down the ladder and started
for down-stairs; but as I come to the girls' room the door was open, and
I see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk, which was open and she'd
been packing things in it--getting ready to go to England.  But she
had stopped now with a folded gown in her lap, and had her face in her
hands, crying.  I felt awful bad to see it; of course anybody would.  I
went in there and says:
Miss Mary Jane, you can't a-bear to see people in trouble, and I
can't--most always.  Tell me about it.
So she done it.  And it was the niggers--I just expected it.  She said
the beautiful trip to England was most about spoiled for her; she didn't
know _how_ she was ever going to be happy there, knowing the mother and
the children warn't ever going to see each other no more--and then busted
out bitterer than ever, and flung up her hands, and says:
Oh, dear, dear, to think they ain't _ever_ going to see each other any
more!
But they _will_--and inside of two weeks--and I _know_ it! says I.
Laws, it was out before I could think!  And before I could budge she
throws her arms around my neck and told me to say it _again_, say it
_again_, say it _again_!
I see I had spoke too sudden and said too much, and was in a close
place. I asked her to let me think a minute; and she set there, very
impatient and excited and handsome, but looking kind of happy and
eased-up, like a person that's had a tooth pulled out.  So I went to
studying it out.  I says to myself, I reckon a body that ups and tells
the truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks,
though I ain't had no experience, and can't say for certain; but it
looks so to me, anyway; and yet here's a case where I'm blest if it
don't look to me like the truth is better and actuly _safer_ than a lie.
I must lay it by in my mind, and think it over some time or other, it's
so kind of strange and unregular. I never see nothing like it.  Well, I
says to myself at last, I'm a-going to chance it; I'll up and tell the
truth this time, though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of
powder and touching it off just to see where you'll go to. Then I says:
Miss Mary Jane, is there any place out of town a little ways where you
could go and stay three or four days?
Yes; Mr. Lothrop's.  Why?
Never mind why yet.  If I'll tell you how I know the niggers will see
each other again inside of two weeks--here in this house--and _prove_ how
I know it--will you go to Mr. Lothrop's and stay four days?
Four days! she says; I'll stay a year!
All right, I says, I don't want nothing more out of _you_ than just
your word--I druther have it than another man's kiss-the-Bible.  She
smiled and reddened up very sweet, and I says, If you don't mind it,
I'll shut the door--and bolt it.
Then I come back and set down again, and says:
Don't you holler.  Just set still and take it like a man.  I got to
tell the truth, and you want to brace up, Miss Mary, because it's a
bad kind, and going to be hard to take, but there ain't no help for
it.  These uncles of yourn ain't no uncles at all; they're a couple of
frauds--regular dead-beats.  There, now we're over the worst of it, you
can stand the rest middling easy.
It jolted her up like everything, of course; but I was over the shoal
water now, so I went right along, her eyes a-blazing higher and higher
all the time, and told her every blame thing, from where we first struck
that young fool going up to the steamboat, clear through to where she
flung herself on to the king's breast at the front door and he kissed
her sixteen or seventeen times--and then up she jumps, with her face
afire like sunset, and says:
The brute!  Come, don't waste a minute--not a _second_--we'll have them
tarred and feathered, and flung in the river!
Says I:
Cert'nly.  But do you mean _before_ you go to Mr. Lothrop's, or--
Oh, she says, what am I _thinking_ about! she says, and set right
down again.  Don't mind what I said--please don't--you _won't,_ now,
_will_ you? Laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that
I said I would die first.  I never thought, I was so stirred up, she
says; now go on, and I won't do so any more.  You tell me what to do,
and whatever you say I'll do it.
Well, I says, it's a rough gang, them two frauds, and I'm fixed so
I got to travel with them a while longer, whether I want to or not--I
druther not tell you why; and if you was to blow on them this town would
get me out of their claws, and I'd be all right; but there'd be another
person that you don't know about who'd be in big trouble.  Well, we
got to save _him_, hain't we?  Of course.  Well, then, we won't blow on
them.
Saying them words put a good idea in my head.  I see how maybe I could
get me and Jim rid of the frauds; get them jailed here, and then leave.
But I didn't want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody aboard
to answer questions but me; so I didn't want the plan to begin working
till pretty late to-night.  I says:
Miss Mary Jane, I'll tell you what we'll do, and you won't have to stay
at Mr. Lothrop's so long, nuther.  How fur is it?
A little short of four miles--right out in the country, back here.
Well, that 'll answer.  Now you go along out there, and lay low
till nine or half-past to-night, and then get them to fetch you home
again--tell them you've thought of something.  If you get here before
eleven put a candle in this window, and if I don't turn up wait _till_
eleven, and _then_ if I don't turn up it means I'm gone, and out of the
way, and safe. Then you come out and spread the news around, and get
these beats jailed.
Good, she says, I'll do it.
And if it just happens so that I don't get away, but get took up along
with them, you must up and say I told you the whole thing beforehand,
and you must stand by me all you can.
Stand by you! indeed I will.  They sha'n't touch a hair of your head!
she says, and I see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she said
it, too.
If I get away I sha'n't be here, I says, to prove these rapscallions
ain't your uncles, and I couldn't do it if I _was_ here.  I could swear
they was beats and bummers, that's all, though that's worth something.
Well, there's others can do that better than what I can, and they're
people that ain't going to be doubted as quick as I'd be.  I'll tell you
how to find them.  Gimme a pencil and a piece of paper.  There--'Royal
Nonesuch, Bricksville.'  Put it away, and don't lose it.  When the
court wants to find out something about these two, let them send up to
Bricksville and say they've got the men that played the Royal Nonesuch,
and ask for some witnesses--why, you'll have that entire town down here
before you can hardly wink, Miss Mary.  And they'll come a-biling, too.
I judged we had got everything fixed about right now.  So I says:
Just let the auction go right along, and don't worry.  Nobody don't
have to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction
on accounts of the short notice, and they ain't going out of this till
they get that money; and the way we've fixed it the sale ain't going to
count, and they ain't going to get no money.  It's just like the way
it was with the niggers--it warn't no sale, and the niggers will be
back before long.  Why, they can't collect the money for the _niggers_
yet--they're in the worst kind of a fix, Miss Mary.
Well, she says, I'll run down to breakfast now, and then I'll start
straight for Mr. Lothrop's.
'Deed, _that_ ain't the ticket, Miss Mary Jane, I says, by no manner
of means; go _before_ breakfast.
Why?
What did you reckon I wanted you to go at all for, Miss Mary?
Well, I never thought--and come to think, I don't know.  What was it?
Why, it's because you ain't one of these leather-face people.  I don't
want no better book than what your face is.  A body can set down and
read it off like coarse print.  Do you reckon you can go and face your
uncles when they come to kiss you good-morning, and never--
There, there, don't!  Yes, I'll go before breakfast--I'll be glad to.
And leave my sisters with them?
Yes; never mind about them.  They've got to stand it yet a while.  They
might suspicion something if all of you was to go.  I don't want you to
see them, nor your sisters, nor nobody in this town; if a neighbor was
to ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something.
No, you go right along, Miss Mary Jane, and I'll fix it with all of
them. I'll tell Miss Susan to give your love to your uncles and say
you've went away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change, or
to see a friend, and you'll be back to-night or early in the morning.
Gone to see a friend is all right, but I won't have my love given to
them.
Well, then, it sha'n't be.  It was well enough to tell _her_ so--no
harm in it.  It was only a little thing to do, and no trouble; and it's
the little things that smooths people's roads the most, down here below;
it would make Mary Jane comfortable, and it wouldn't cost nothing.  Then
I says:  There's one more thing--that bag of money.
Well, they've got that; and it makes me feel pretty silly to think
_how_ they got it.
No, you're out, there.  They hain't got it.
Why, who's got it?
I wish I knowed, but I don't.  I _had_ it, because I stole it from
them; and I stole it to give to you; and I know where I hid it, but I'm
afraid it ain't there no more.  I'm awful sorry, Miss Mary Jane, I'm
just as sorry as I can be; but I done the best I could; I did honest.  I
come nigh getting caught, and I had to shove it into the first place I
come to, and run--and it warn't a good place.
Oh, stop blaming yourself--it's too bad to do it, and I won't allow
it--you couldn't help it; it wasn't your fault.  Where did you hide it?
I didn't want to set her to thinking about her troubles again; and I
couldn't seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that
corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach.  So
for a minute I didn't say nothing; then I says:
I'd ruther not _tell_ you where I put it, Miss Mary Jane, if you don't
mind letting me off; but I'll write it for you on a piece of paper, and
you can read it along the road to Mr. Lothrop's, if you want to.  Do you
reckon that 'll do?
Oh, yes.
So I wrote:  I put it in the coffin.  It was in there when you was
crying there, away in the night.  I was behind the door, and I was
mighty sorry for you, Miss Mary Jane.
It made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by
herself in the night, and them devils laying there right under her own
roof, shaming her and robbing her; and when I folded it up and give it
to her I see the water come into her eyes, too; and she shook me by the
hand, hard, and says:
_Good_-bye.  I'm going to do everything just as you've told me; and if
I don't ever see you again, I sha'n't ever forget you and I'll think of
you a many and a many a time, and I'll _pray_ for you, too!--and she was
gone.
Pray for me!  I reckoned if she knowed me she'd take a job that was more
nearer her size.  But I bet she done it, just the same--she was just that
kind.  She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took the notion--there
warn't no back-down to her, I judge.  You may say what you want to, but
in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl I ever see; in
my opinion she was just full of sand.  It sounds like flattery, but it
ain't no flattery.  And when it comes to beauty--and goodness, too--she
lays over them all.  I hain't ever seen her since that time that I see
her go out of that door; no, I hain't ever seen her since, but I reckon
I've thought of her a many and a many a million times, and of her saying
she would pray for me; and if ever I'd a thought it would do any good
for me to pray for _her_, blamed if I wouldn't a done it or bust.
Well, Mary Jane she lit out the back way, I reckon; because nobody see
her go.  When I struck Susan and the hare-lip, I says:
What's the name of them people over on t'other side of the river that
you all goes to see sometimes?
They says:
There's several; but it's the Proctors, mainly.
That's the name, I says; I most forgot it.  Well, Miss Mary Jane she
told me to tell you she's gone over there in a dreadful hurry--one of
them's sick.
Which one?
I don't know; leastways, I kinder forget; but I thinks it's--
Sakes alive, I hope it ain't _Hanner_?
I'm sorry to say it, I says, but Hanner's the very one.
My goodness, and she so well only last week!  Is she took bad?
It ain't no name for it.  They set up with her all night, Miss Mary
Jane said, and they don't think she'll last many hours.
Only think of that, now!  What's the matter with her?
I couldn't think of anything reasonable, right off that way, so I says:
Mumps.
Mumps your granny!  They don't set up with people that's got the
mumps.
They don't, don't they?  You better bet they do with _these_ mumps.
These mumps is different.  It's a new kind, Miss Mary Jane said.
How's it a new kind?
Because it's mixed up with other things.
What other things?
Well, measles, and whooping-cough, and erysiplas, and consumption, and
yaller janders, and brain-fever, and I don't know what all.
My land!  And they call it the _mumps_?
That's what Miss Mary Jane said.
Well, what in the nation do they call it the _mumps_ for?
Why, because it _is_ the mumps.  That's what it starts with.
Well, ther' ain't no sense in it.  A body might stump his toe, and take
pison, and fall down the well, and break his neck, and bust his brains
out, and somebody come along and ask what killed him, and some numskull
up and say, 'Why, he stumped his _toe_.'  Would ther' be any sense
in that? _No_.  And ther' ain't no sense in _this_, nuther.  Is it
ketching?
Is it _ketching_?  Why, how you talk.  Is a _harrow_ catching--in the
dark? If you don't hitch on to one tooth, you're bound to on another,
ain't you? And you can't get away with that tooth without fetching the
whole harrow along, can you?  Well, these kind of mumps is a kind of a
harrow, as you may say--and it ain't no slouch of a harrow, nuther, you
come to get it hitched on good.
Well, it's awful, I think, says the hare-lip.  I'll go to Uncle
Harvey and--
Oh, yes, I says, I _would_.  Of _course_ I would.  I wouldn't lose no
time.
Well, why wouldn't you?
Just look at it a minute, and maybe you can see.  Hain't your uncles
obleegd to get along home to England as fast as they can?  And do you
reckon they'd be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that
journey by yourselves?  _you_ know they'll wait for you.  So fur, so
good. Your uncle Harvey's a preacher, ain't he?  Very well, then; is a
_preacher_ going to deceive a steamboat clerk? is he going to deceive
a _ship clerk?_--so as to get them to let Miss Mary Jane go aboard?  Now
_you_ know he ain't.  What _will_ he do, then?  Why, he'll say, 'It's a
great pity, but my church matters has got to get along the best way they
can; for my niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribus-unum mumps,
and so it's my bounden duty to set down here and wait the three months
it takes to show on her if she's got it.'  But never mind, if you think
it's best to tell your uncle Harvey--
Shucks, and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good
times in England whilst we was waiting to find out whether Mary Jane's
got it or not?  Why, you talk like a muggins.
Well, anyway, maybe you'd better tell some of the neighbors.
Listen at that, now.  You do beat all for natural stupidness.  Can't
you _see_ that _they'd_ go and tell?  Ther' ain't no way but just to not
tell anybody at _all_.
Well, maybe you're right--yes, I judge you _are_ right.
But I reckon we ought to tell Uncle Harvey she's gone out a while,
anyway, so he won't be uneasy about her?
Yes, Miss Mary Jane she wanted you to do that.  She says, 'Tell them to
give Uncle Harvey and William my love and a kiss, and say I've run over
the river to see Mr.'--Mr.--what _is_ the name of that rich family your
uncle Peter used to think so much of?--I mean the one that--
Why, you must mean the Apthorps, ain't it?
Of course; bother them kind of names, a body can't ever seem to
remember them, half the time, somehow.  Yes, she said, say she has run
over for to ask the Apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buy
this house, because she allowed her uncle Peter would ruther they had
it than anybody else; and she's going to stick to them till they say
they'll come, and then, if she ain't too tired, she's coming home; and
if she is, she'll be home in the morning anyway.  She said, don't say
nothing about the Proctors, but only about the Apthorps--which 'll be
perfectly true, because she is going there to speak about their buying
the house; I know it, because she told me so herself.
All right, they said, and cleared out to lay for their uncles, and
give them the love and the kisses, and tell them the message.
Everything was all right now.  The girls wouldn't say nothing because
they wanted to go to England; and the king and the duke would ruther
Mary Jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of
Doctor Robinson.  I felt very good; I judged I had done it pretty neat--I
reckoned Tom Sawyer couldn't a done it no neater himself.  Of course he
would a throwed more style into it, but I can't do that very handy, not
being brung up to it.
Well, they held the auction in the public square, along towards the end
of the afternoon, and it strung along, and strung along, and the old man
he was on hand and looking his level pisonest, up there longside of the
auctioneer, and chipping in a little Scripture now and then, or a little
goody-goody saying of some kind, and the duke he was around goo-gooing
for sympathy all he knowed how, and just spreading himself generly.
But by and by the thing dragged through, and everything was
sold--everything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard.  So
they'd got to work that off--I never see such a girafft as the king was
for wanting to swallow _everything_.  Well, whilst they was at it a
steamboat landed, and in about two minutes up comes a crowd a-whooping
and yelling and laughing and carrying on, and singing out:
_Here's_ your opposition line! here's your two sets o' heirs to old
Peter Wilks--and you pays your money and you takes your choice!
CHAPTER XXIX.
THEY was fetching a very nice-looking old gentleman along, and a
nice-looking younger one, with his right arm in a sling.  And, my souls,
how the people yelled and laughed, and kept it up.  But I didn't see no
joke about it, and I judged it would strain the duke and the king some
to see any.  I reckoned they'd turn pale.  But no, nary a pale did
_they_ turn. The duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up, but
just went a goo-gooing around, happy and satisfied, like a jug that's
googling out buttermilk; and as for the king, he just gazed and gazed
down sorrowful on them new-comers like it give him the stomach-ache in
his very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in the
world.  Oh, he done it admirable.  Lots of the principal people
gethered around the king, to let him see they was on his side.  That old
gentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death.  Pretty
soon he begun to speak, and I see straight off he pronounced _like_ an
Englishman--not the king's way, though the king's _was_ pretty good for
an imitation.  I can't give the old gent's words, nor I can't imitate
him; but he turned around to the crowd, and says, about like this:
This is a surprise to me which I wasn't looking for; and I'll
acknowledge, candid and frank, I ain't very well fixed to meet it and
answer it; for my brother and me has had misfortunes; he's broke his
arm, and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the
night by a mistake.  I am Peter Wilks' brother Harvey, and this is his
brother William, which can't hear nor speak--and can't even make signs to
amount to much, now't he's only got one hand to work them with.  We are
who we say we are; and in a day or two, when I get the baggage, I can
prove it. But up till then I won't say nothing more, but go to the hotel
and wait.
So him and the new dummy started off; and the king he laughs, and
blethers out:
Broke his arm--_very_ likely, _ain't_ it?--and very convenient, too,
for a fraud that's got to make signs, and ain't learnt how.  Lost
their baggage! That's _mighty_ good!--and mighty ingenious--under the
_circumstances_!
So he laughed again; and so did everybody else, except three or four,
or maybe half a dozen.  One of these was that doctor; another one was
a sharp-looking gentleman, with a carpet-bag of the old-fashioned kind
made out of carpet-stuff, that had just come off of the steamboat and
was talking to him in a low voice, and glancing towards the king now and
then and nodding their heads--it was Levi Bell, the lawyer that was gone
up to Louisville; and another one was a big rough husky that come along
and listened to all the old gentleman said, and was listening to the
king now. And when the king got done this husky up and says:
Say, looky here; if you are Harvey Wilks, when'd you come to this
town?
The day before the funeral, friend, says the king.
But what time o' day?
In the evenin'--'bout an hour er two before sundown.
_How'd_ you come?
I come down on the Susan Powell from Cincinnati.
Well, then, how'd you come to be up at the Pint in the _mornin_'--in a
canoe?
I warn't up at the Pint in the mornin'.
It's a lie.
Several of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an
old man and a preacher.
Preacher be hanged, he's a fraud and a liar.  He was up at the Pint
that mornin'.  I live up there, don't I?  Well, I was up there, and
he was up there.  I see him there.  He come in a canoe, along with Tim
Collins and a boy.
The doctor he up and says:
Would you know the boy again if you was to see him, Hines?
I reckon I would, but I don't know.  Why, yonder he is, now.  I know
him perfectly easy.
It was me he pointed at.  The doctor says:
Neighbors, I don't know whether the new couple is frauds or not; but if
_these_ two ain't frauds, I am an idiot, that's all.  I think it's our
duty to see that they don't get away from here till we've looked into
this thing. Come along, Hines; come along, the rest of you.  We'll take
these fellows to the tavern and affront them with t'other couple, and I
reckon we'll find out _something_ before we get through.
It was nuts for the crowd, though maybe not for the king's friends; so
we all started.  It was about sundown.  The doctor he led me along by
the hand, and was plenty kind enough, but he never let go my hand.
We all got in a big room in the hotel, and lit up some candles, and
fetched in the new couple.  First, the doctor says:
I don't wish to be too hard on these two men, but I think they're
frauds, and they may have complices that we don't know nothing about.
If they have, won't the complices get away with that bag of gold Peter
Wilks left?  It ain't unlikely.  If these men ain't frauds, they won't
object to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove
they're all right--ain't that so?
Everybody agreed to that.  So I judged they had our gang in a pretty
tight place right at the outstart.  But the king he only looked
sorrowful, and says:
Gentlemen, I wish the money was there, for I ain't got no disposition
to throw anything in the way of a fair, open, out-and-out investigation
o' this misable business; but, alas, the money ain't there; you k'n send
and see, if you want to.
Where is it, then?
Well, when my niece give it to me to keep for her I took and hid it
inside o' the straw tick o' my bed, not wishin' to bank it for the few
days we'd be here, and considerin' the bed a safe place, we not bein'
used to niggers, and suppos'n' 'em honest, like servants in England.
The niggers stole it the very next mornin' after I had went down
stairs; and when I sold 'em I hadn't missed the money yit, so they got
clean away with it.  My servant here k'n tell you 'bout it, gentlemen.
The doctor and several said Shucks! and I see nobody didn't altogether
believe him.  One man asked me if I see the niggers steal it.  I said
no, but I see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away, and I
never thought nothing, only I reckoned they was afraid they had waked up
my master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them.
That was all they asked me.  Then the doctor whirls on me and says:
Are _you_ English, too?
I says yes; and him and some others laughed, and said, Stuff!
Well, then they sailed in on the general investigation, and there we had
it, up and down, hour in, hour out, and nobody never said a word about
supper, nor ever seemed to think about it--and so they kept it up, and
kept it up; and it _was_ the worst mixed-up thing you ever see.  They
made the king tell his yarn, and they made the old gentleman tell his'n;
and anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a _seen_ that the
old gentleman was spinning truth and t'other one lies.  And by and by
they had me up to tell what I knowed.  The king he give me a left-handed
look out of the corner of his eye, and so I knowed enough to talk on the
right side.  I begun to tell about Sheffield, and how we lived there,
and all about the English Wilkses, and so on; but I didn't get pretty
fur till the doctor begun to laugh; and Levi Bell, the lawyer, says:
Set down, my boy; I wouldn't strain myself if I was you.  I reckon
you ain't used to lying, it don't seem to come handy; what you want is
practice.  You do it pretty awkward.
I didn't care nothing for the compliment, but I was glad to be let off,
anyway.
The doctor he started to say something, and turns and says:
If you'd been in town at first, Levi Bell-- The king broke in and
reached out his hand, and says:
Why, is this my poor dead brother's old friend that he's wrote so often
about?
The lawyer and him shook hands, and the lawyer smiled and looked
pleased, and they talked right along awhile, and then got to one side
and talked low; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says:
That 'll fix it.  I'll take the order and send it, along with your
brother's, and then they'll know it's all right.
So they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and twisted
his head to one side, and chawed his tongue, and scrawled off something;
and then they give the pen to the duke--and then for the first time the
duke looked sick.  But he took the pen and wrote.  So then the lawyer
turns to the new old gentleman and says:
You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names.
The old gentleman wrote, but nobody couldn't read it.  The lawyer looked
powerful astonished, and says:
Well, it beats _me_--and snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket,
and examined them, and then examined the old man's writing, and then
_them_ again; and then says:  These old letters is from Harvey Wilks;
and here's _these_ two handwritings, and anybody can see they didn't
write them (the king and the duke looked sold and foolish, I tell
you, to see how the lawyer had took them in), and here's _this_ old
gentleman's hand writing, and anybody can tell, easy enough, _he_ didn't
write them--fact is, the scratches he makes ain't properly _writing_ at
all.  Now, here's some letters from--
The new old gentleman says:
If you please, let me explain.  Nobody can read my hand but my brother
there--so he copies for me.  It's _his_ hand you've got there, not mine.
_Well_! says the lawyer, this _is_ a state of things.  I've got some
of William's letters, too; so if you'll get him to write a line or so we
can com--
He _can't_ write with his left hand, says the old gentleman.  If he
could use his right hand, you would see that he wrote his own letters
and mine too.  Look at both, please--they're by the same hand.
The lawyer done it, and says:
I believe it's so--and if it ain't so, there's a heap stronger
resemblance than I'd noticed before, anyway.  Well, well, well!  I
thought we was right on the track of a solution, but it's gone to grass,
partly.  But anyway, one thing is proved--_these_ two ain't either of 'em
Wilkses--and he wagged his head towards the king and the duke.
Well, what do you think?  That muleheaded old fool wouldn't give in
_then_! Indeed he wouldn't.  Said it warn't no fair test.  Said his
brother William was the cussedest joker in the world, and hadn't tried
to write--_he_ see William was going to play one of his jokes the minute
he put the pen to paper.  And so he warmed up and went warbling and
warbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was
saying _himself_; but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in, and says:
I've thought of something.  Is there anybody here that helped to lay
out my br--helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying?
Yes, says somebody, me and Ab Turner done it.  We're both here.
Then the old man turns towards the king, and says:
Perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast?
Blamed if the king didn't have to brace up mighty quick, or he'd a
squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under, it took
him so sudden; and, mind you, it was a thing that was calculated to make
most _anybody_ sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any
notice, because how was _he_ going to know what was tattooed on the man?
He whitened a little; he couldn't help it; and it was mighty still in
there, and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him.  Says
I to myself, _now_ he'll throw up the sponge--there ain't no more use.
Well, did he?  A body can't hardly believe it, but he didn't.  I reckon
he thought he'd keep the thing up till he tired them people out, so
they'd thin out, and him and the duke could break loose and get away.
Anyway, he set there, and pretty soon he begun to smile, and says:
Mf!  It's a _very_ tough question, _ain't_ it!  _yes_, sir, I k'n
tell you what's tattooed on his breast.  It's jest a small, thin, blue
arrow--that's what it is; and if you don't look clost, you can't see it.
_now_ what do you say--hey?
Well, I never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-out
cheek.
The new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard, and
his eye lights up like he judged he'd got the king _this_ time, and
says:
There--you've heard what he said!  Was there any such mark on Peter
Wilks' breast?
Both of them spoke up and says:
We didn't see no such mark.
Good! says the old gentleman.  Now, what you _did_ see on his breast
was a small dim P, and a B (which is an initial he dropped when he was
young), and a W, with dashes between them, so:  P--B--W--and he marked
them that way on a piece of paper.  Come, ain't that what you saw?
Both of them spoke up again, and says:
No, we _didn't_.  We never seen any marks at all.
Well, everybody _was_ in a state of mind now, and they sings out:
The whole _bilin_' of 'm 's frauds!  Le's duck 'em! le's drown 'em!
le's ride 'em on a rail! and everybody was whooping at once, and there
was a rattling powwow.  But the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells,
and says:
Gentlemen--gentle_men!_  Hear me just a word--just a _single_ word--if you
_please_!  There's one way yet--let's go and dig up the corpse and look.
That took them.
Hooray! they all shouted, and was starting right off; but the lawyer
and the doctor sung out:
Hold on, hold on!  Collar all these four men and the boy, and fetch
_them_ along, too!
We'll do it! they all shouted; and if we don't find them marks we'll
lynch the whole gang!
I _was_ scared, now, I tell you.  But there warn't no getting away, you
know. They gripped us all, and marched us right along, straight for the
graveyard, which was a mile and a half down the river, and the whole
town at our heels, for we made noise enough, and it was only nine in the
evening.
As we went by our house I wished I hadn't sent Mary Jane out of town;
because now if I could tip her the wink she'd light out and save me, and
blow on our dead-beats.
Well, we swarmed along down the river road, just carrying on like
wildcats; and to make it more scary the sky was darking up, and the
lightning beginning to wink and flitter, and the wind to shiver amongst
the leaves. This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I ever
was in; and I was kinder stunned; everything was going so different from
what I had allowed for; stead of being fixed so I could take my own time
if I wanted to, and see all the fun, and have Mary Jane at my back to
save me and set me free when the close-fit come, here was nothing in the
world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoo-marks.  If they
didn't find them--
I couldn't bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn't think
about nothing else.  It got darker and darker, and it was a beautiful
time to give the crowd the slip; but that big husky had me by the
wrist--Hines--and a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip.  He
dragged me right along, he was so excited, and I had to run to keep up.
When they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it
like an overflow.  And when they got to the grave they found they had
about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted, but nobody hadn't
thought to fetch a lantern.  But they sailed into digging anyway by the
flicker of the lightning, and sent a man to the nearest house, a half a
mile off, to borrow one.
So they dug and dug like everything; and it got awful dark, and the rain
started, and the wind swished and swushed along, and the lightning come
brisker and brisker, and the thunder boomed; but them people never took
no notice of it, they was so full of this business; and one minute
you could see everything and every face in that big crowd, and the
shovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave, and the next second the
dark wiped it all out, and you couldn't see nothing at all.
At last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid, and then
such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was, to
scrouge in and get a sight, you never see; and in the dark, that way, it
was awful.  Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so,
and I reckon he clean forgot I was in the world, he was so excited and
panting.
All of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare,
and somebody sings out:
By the living jingo, here's the bag of gold on his breast!
Hines let out a whoop, like everybody else, and dropped my wrist and
give a big surge to bust his way in and get a look, and the way I lit
out and shinned for the road in the dark there ain't nobody can tell.
I had the road all to myself, and I fairly flew--leastways, I had it all
to myself except the solid dark, and the now-and-then glares, and the
buzzing of the rain, and the thrashing of the wind, and the splitting of
the thunder; and sure as you are born I did clip it along!
When I struck the town I see there warn't nobody out in the storm, so
I never hunted for no back streets, but humped it straight through the
main one; and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye and
set it. No light there; the house all dark--which made me feel sorry and
disappointed, I didn't know why.  But at last, just as I was sailing by,
_flash_ comes the light in Mary Jane's window! and my heart swelled up
sudden, like to bust; and the same second the house and all was behind
me in the dark, and wasn't ever going to be before me no more in this
world. She _was_ the best girl I ever see, and had the most sand.
The minute I was far enough above the town to see I could make the
towhead, I begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow, and the first
time the lightning showed me one that wasn't chained I snatched it and
shoved. It was a canoe, and warn't fastened with nothing but a rope.
The towhead was a rattling big distance off, away out there in the
middle of the river, but I didn't lose no time; and when I struck the
raft at last I was so fagged I would a just laid down to blow and gasp
if I could afforded it.  But I didn't.  As I sprung aboard I sung out:
Out with you, Jim, and set her loose!  Glory be to goodness, we're shut
of them!
Jim lit out, and was a-coming for me with both arms spread, he was so
full of joy; but when I glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up
in my mouth and I went overboard backwards; for I forgot he was old King
Lear and a drownded A-rab all in one, and it most scared the livers and
lights out of me.  But Jim fished me out, and was going to hug me and
bless me, and so on, he was so glad I was back and we was shut of the
king and the duke, but I says:
Not now; have it for breakfast, have it for breakfast!  Cut loose and
let her slide!
So in two seconds away we went a-sliding down the river, and it _did_
seem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river, and
nobody to bother us.  I had to skip around a bit, and jump up and crack
my heels a few times--I couldn't help it; but about the third crack
I noticed a sound that I knowed mighty well, and held my breath and
listened and waited; and sure enough, when the next flash busted out
over the water, here they come!--and just a-laying to their oars and
making their skiff hum!  It was the king and the duke.
So I wilted right down on to the planks then, and give up; and it was
all I could do to keep from crying.
CHAPTER XXX.
WHEN they got aboard the king went for me, and shook me by the collar,
and says:
Tryin' to give us the slip, was ye, you pup!  Tired of our company,
hey?
I says:
No, your majesty, we warn't--_please_ don't, your majesty!
Quick, then, and tell us what _was_ your idea, or I'll shake the
insides out o' you!
Honest, I'll tell you everything just as it happened, your majesty.
The man that had a-holt of me was very good to me, and kept saying he
had a boy about as big as me that died last year, and he was sorry
to see a boy in such a dangerous fix; and when they was all took by
surprise by finding the gold, and made a rush for the coffin, he lets go
of me and whispers, 'Heel it now, or they'll hang ye, sure!' and I lit
out.  It didn't seem no good for _me_ to stay--I couldn't do nothing,
and I didn't want to be hung if I could get away.  So I never stopped
running till I found the canoe; and when I got here I told Jim to hurry,
or they'd catch me and hang me yet, and said I was afeard you and the
duke wasn't alive now, and I was awful sorry, and so was Jim, and was
awful glad when we see you coming; you may ask Jim if I didn't.
Jim said it was so; and the king told him to shut up, and said, Oh,
yes, it's _mighty_ likely! and shook me up again, and said he reckoned
he'd drownd me.  But the duke says:
Leggo the boy, you old idiot!  Would _you_ a done any different?  Did
you inquire around for _him_ when you got loose?  I don't remember it.
So the king let go of me, and begun to cuss that town and everybody in
it. But the duke says:
You better a blame' sight give _yourself_ a good cussing, for you're
the one that's entitled to it most.  You hain't done a thing from the
start that had any sense in it, except coming out so cool and cheeky
with that imaginary blue-arrow mark.  That _was_ bright--it was right
down bully; and it was the thing that saved us.  For if it hadn't been
for that they'd a jailed us till them Englishmen's baggage come--and
then--the penitentiary, you bet! But that trick took 'em to the
graveyard, and the gold done us a still bigger kindness; for if the
excited fools hadn't let go all holts and made that rush to get a
look we'd a slept in our cravats to-night--cravats warranted to _wear_,
too--longer than _we'd_ need 'em.
They was still a minute--thinking; then the king says, kind of
absent-minded like:
Mf!  And we reckoned the _niggers_ stole it!
That made me squirm!
Yes, says the duke, kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic, _we_
did.
After about a half a minute the king drawls out:
Leastways, I did.
The duke says, the same way:
On the contrary, I did.
The king kind of ruffles up, and says:
Looky here, Bilgewater, what'r you referrin' to?
The duke says, pretty brisk:
When it comes to that, maybe you'll let me ask, what was _you_
referring to?
Shucks! says the king, very sarcastic; but I don't know--maybe you was
asleep, and didn't know what you was about.
The duke bristles up now, and says:
Oh, let _up_ on this cussed nonsense; do you take me for a blame' fool?
Don't you reckon I know who hid that money in that coffin?
_Yes_, sir!  I know you _do_ know, because you done it yourself!
It's a lie!--and the duke went for him.  The king sings out:
Take y'r hands off!--leggo my throat!--I take it all back!
The duke says:
Well, you just own up, first, that you _did_ hide that money there,
intending to give me the slip one of these days, and come back and dig
it up, and have it all to yourself.
Wait jest a minute, duke--answer me this one question, honest and fair;
if you didn't put the money there, say it, and I'll b'lieve you, and
take back everything I said.
You old scoundrel, I didn't, and you know I didn't.  There, now!
Well, then, I b'lieve you.  But answer me only jest this one more--now
_don't_ git mad; didn't you have it in your mind to hook the money and
hide it?
The duke never said nothing for a little bit; then he says:
Well, I don't care if I _did_, I didn't _do_ it, anyway.  But you not
only had it in mind to do it, but you _done_ it.
I wisht I never die if I done it, duke, and that's honest.  I won't say
I warn't goin' to do it, because I _was_; but you--I mean somebody--got in
ahead o' me.
It's a lie!  You done it, and you got to _say_ you done it, or--
The king began to gurgle, and then he gasps out:
'Nough!--I _own up!_
I was very glad to hear him say that; it made me feel much more easier
than what I was feeling before.  So the duke took his hands off and
says:
If you ever deny it again I'll drown you.  It's _well_ for you to set
there and blubber like a baby--it's fitten for you, after the way
you've acted. I never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble
everything--and I a-trusting you all the time, like you was my own
father.  You ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it
saddled on to a lot of poor niggers, and you never say a word for 'em.
It makes me feel ridiculous to think I was soft enough to _believe_
that rubbage.  Cuss you, I can see now why you was so anxious to make
up the deffisit--you wanted to get what money I'd got out of the Nonesuch
and one thing or another, and scoop it _all_!
The king says, timid, and still a-snuffling:
Why, duke, it was you that said make up the deffisit; it warn't me.
Dry up!  I don't want to hear no more out of you! says the duke.  And
_now_ you see what you GOT by it.  They've got all their own money back,
and all of _ourn_ but a shekel or two _besides_.  G'long to bed, and
don't you deffersit _me_ no more deffersits, long 's _you_ live!
So the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort,
and before long the duke tackled HIS bottle; and so in about a half an
hour they was as thick as thieves again, and the tighter they got the
lovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in each other's arms.  They
both got powerful mellow, but I noticed the king didn't get mellow
enough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money-bag
again.  That made me feel easy and satisfied.  Of course when they got
to snoring we had a long gabble, and I told Jim everything.
CHAPTER XXXI.
WE dasn't stop again at any town for days and days; kept right along
down the river.  We was down south in the warm weather now, and a mighty
long ways from home.  We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on
them, hanging down from the limbs like long, gray beards.  It was the
first I ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn and
dismal.  So now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger, and they
begun to work the villages again.
First they done a lecture on temperance; but they didn't make enough
for them both to get drunk on.  Then in another village they started
a dancing-school; but they didn't know no more how to dance than a
kangaroo does; so the first prance they made the general public jumped
in and pranced them out of town.  Another time they tried to go at
yellocution; but they didn't yellocute long till the audience got up and
give them a solid good cussing, and made them skip out.  They tackled
missionarying, and mesmerizing, and doctoring, and telling fortunes, and
a little of everything; but they couldn't seem to have no luck.  So at
last they got just about dead broke, and laid around the raft as she
floated along, thinking and thinking, and never saying nothing, by the
half a day at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate.
And at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in
the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time.
Jim and me got uneasy.  We didn't like the look of it.  We judged they
was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever.  We turned it
over and over, and at last we made up our minds they was going to break
into somebody's house or store, or was going into the counterfeit-money
business, or something. So then we was pretty scared, and made up an
agreement that we wouldn't have nothing in the world to do with such
actions, and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold
shake and clear out and leave them behind. Well, early one morning we
hid the raft in a good, safe place about two mile below a little bit of
a shabby village named Pikesville, and the king he went ashore and told
us all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see
if anybody had got any wind of the Royal Nonesuch there yet. (House to
rob, you _mean_, says I to myself; and when you get through robbing it
you'll come back here and wonder what has become of me and Jim and the
raft--and you'll have to take it out in wondering.) And he said if he
warn't back by midday the duke and me would know it was all right, and
we was to come along.
So we stayed where we was.  The duke he fretted and sweated around, and
was in a mighty sour way.  He scolded us for everything, and we couldn't
seem to do nothing right; he found fault with every little thing.
Something was a-brewing, sure.  I was good and glad when midday come
and no king; we could have a change, anyway--and maybe a chance for _the_
change on top of it.  So me and the duke went up to the village, and
hunted around there for the king, and by and by we found him in the
back room of a little low doggery, very tight, and a lot of loafers
bullyragging him for sport, and he a-cussing and a-threatening with all
his might, and so tight he couldn't walk, and couldn't do nothing to
them.  The duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool, and the king
begun to sass back, and the minute they was fairly at it I lit out and
shook the reefs out of my hind legs, and spun down the river road like
a deer, for I see our chance; and I made up my mind that it would be a
long day before they ever see me and Jim again.  I got down there all
out of breath but loaded up with joy, and sung out:
Set her loose, Jim! we're all right now!
But there warn't no answer, and nobody come out of the wigwam.  Jim was
gone!  I set up a shout--and then another--and then another one; and run
this way and that in the woods, whooping and screeching; but it warn't
no use--old Jim was gone.  Then I set down and cried; I couldn't help
it. But I couldn't set still long.  Pretty soon I went out on the road,
trying to think what I better do, and I run across a boy walking, and
asked him if he'd seen a strange nigger dressed so and so, and he says:
Yes.
Whereabouts? says I.
Down to Silas Phelps' place, two mile below here.  He's a runaway
nigger, and they've got him.  Was you looking for him?
You bet I ain't!  I run across him in the woods about an hour or two
ago, and he said if I hollered he'd cut my livers out--and told me to lay
down and stay where I was; and I done it.  Been there ever since; afeard
to come out.
Well, he says, you needn't be afeard no more, becuz they've got him.
He run off f'm down South, som'ers.
It's a good job they got him.
Well, I _reckon_!  There's two hunderd dollars reward on him.  It's
like picking up money out'n the road.
Yes, it is--and I could a had it if I'd been big enough; I see him
_first_. Who nailed him?
It was an old fellow--a stranger--and he sold out his chance in him for
forty dollars, becuz he's got to go up the river and can't wait.  Think
o' that, now!  You bet _I'd_ wait, if it was seven year.
That's me, every time, says I.  But maybe his chance ain't worth
no more than that, if he'll sell it so cheap.  Maybe there's something
ain't straight about it.
But it _is_, though--straight as a string.  I see the handbill myself.
It tells all about him, to a dot--paints him like a picture, and tells
the plantation he's frum, below Newr_leans_.  No-sirree-_bob_, they
ain't no trouble 'bout _that_ speculation, you bet you.  Say, gimme a
chaw tobacker, won't ye?
I didn't have none, so he left.  I went to the raft, and set down in the
wigwam to think.  But I couldn't come to nothing.  I thought till I wore
my head sore, but I couldn't see no way out of the trouble.  After all
this long journey, and after all we'd done for them scoundrels, here it
was all come to nothing, everything all busted up and ruined, because
they could have the heart to serve Jim such a trick as that, and make
him a slave again all his life, and amongst strangers, too, for forty
dirty dollars.
Once I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for Jim to
be a slave at home where his family was, as long as he'd _got_ to be a
slave, and so I'd better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him to
tell Miss Watson where he was.  But I soon give up that notion for two
things: she'd be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness
for leaving her, and so she'd sell him straight down the river again;
and if she didn't, everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger,
and they'd make Jim feel it all the time, and so he'd feel ornery and
disgraced. And then think of _me_!  It would get all around that Huck
Finn helped a nigger to get his freedom; and if I was ever to see
anybody from that town again I'd be ready to get down and lick his boots
for shame.  That's just the way:  a person does a low-down thing, and
then he don't want to take no consequences of it. Thinks as long as he
can hide it, it ain't no disgrace.  That was my fix exactly. The more I
studied about this the more my conscience went to grinding me, and the
more wicked and low-down and ornery I got to feeling. And at last, when
it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of Providence
slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was being
watched all the time from up there in heaven, whilst I was stealing a
poor old woman's nigger that hadn't ever done me no harm, and now was
showing me there's One that's always on the lookout, and ain't a-going
to allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no further,
I most dropped in my tracks I was so scared.  Well, I tried the best I
could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying I was brung
up wicked, and so I warn't so much to blame; but something inside of me
kept saying, There was the Sunday-school, you could a gone to it; and
if you'd a done it they'd a learnt you there that people that acts as
I'd been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire.
It made me shiver.  And I about made up my mind to pray, and see if I
couldn't try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better.  So
I kneeled down.  But the words wouldn't come.  Why wouldn't they?  It
warn't no use to try and hide it from Him.  Nor from _me_, neither.  I
knowed very well why they wouldn't come.  It was because my heart warn't
right; it was because I warn't square; it was because I was playing
double.  I was letting _on_ to give up sin, but away inside of me I was
holding on to the biggest one of all.  I was trying to make my mouth
_say_ I would do the right thing and the clean thing, and go and write
to that nigger's owner and tell where he was; but deep down in me I
knowed it was a lie, and He knowed it.  You can't pray a lie--I found
that out.
So I was full of trouble, full as I could be; and didn't know what to
do. At last I had an idea; and I says, I'll go and write the letter--and
then see if I can pray.  Why, it was astonishing, the way I felt as
light as a feather right straight off, and my troubles all gone.  So I
got a piece of paper and a pencil, all glad and excited, and set down
and wrote:
Miss Watson, your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below
Pikesville, and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the
reward if you send.
_Huck Finn._
I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever
felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now.  But I didn't do it
straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking--thinking
how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost
and going to hell.  And went on thinking.  And got to thinking over our
trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time:  in the day
and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we
a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing.  But somehow I
couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the
other kind.  I'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n, 'stead of
calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when
I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp,
up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call
me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how
good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling
the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was
the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the _only_ one he's
got now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.
It was a close place.  I took it up, and held it in my hand.  I was
a-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and
I knowed it.  I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then
says to myself:
All right, then, I'll _go_ to hell--and tore it up.
It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said.  And I let
them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming.  I shoved the
whole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again,
which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn't.  And
for a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again;
and if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as
long as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.
Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some
considerable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that
suited me.  So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down
the river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my
raft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in.  I slept the
night through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast,
and put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or
another in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore.  I landed
below where I judged was Phelps's place, and hid my bundle in the woods,
and then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her and
sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a quarter
of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.
Then I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on
it, Phelps's Sawmill, and when I come to the farm-houses, two or
three hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn't
see nobody around, though it was good daylight now.  But I didn't mind,
because I didn't want to see nobody just yet--I only wanted to get the
lay of the land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there from
the village, not from below.  So I just took a look, and shoved along,
straight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got there was
the duke.  He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch--three-night
performance--like that other time.  They had the cheek, them frauds!  I
was right on him before I could shirk.  He looked astonished, and says:
Hel-_lo_!  Where'd _you_ come from?  Then he says, kind of glad and
eager, Where's the raft?--got her in a good place?
I says:
Why, that's just what I was going to ask your grace.
Then he didn't look so joyful, and says:
What was your idea for asking _me_? he says.
Well, I says, when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says
to myself, we can't get him home for hours, till he's soberer; so I went
a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait.  A man up and offered
me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch
a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to the boat,
and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him
along, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we after
him.  We didn't have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the
country till we tired him out.  We never got him till dark; then we
fetched him over, and I started down for the raft.  When I got there and
see it was gone, I says to myself, 'They've got into trouble and had to
leave; and they've took my nigger, which is the only nigger I've got in
the world, and now I'm in a strange country, and ain't got no property
no more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;' so I set down and
cried.  I slept in the woods all night.  But what _did_ become of the
raft, then?--and Jim--poor Jim!
Blamed if I know--that is, what's become of the raft.  That old fool had
made a trade and got forty dollars, and when we found him in the doggery
the loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every cent but
what he'd spent for whisky; and when I got him home late last night and
found the raft gone, we said, 'That little rascal has stole our raft and
shook us, and run off down the river.'
I wouldn't shake my _nigger_, would I?--the only nigger I had in the
world, and the only property.
We never thought of that.  Fact is, I reckon we'd come to consider him
_our_ nigger; yes, we did consider him so--goodness knows we had trouble
enough for him.  So when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke,
there warn't anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch another
shake. And I've pegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn.  Where's
that ten cents? Give it here.
I had considerable money, so I give him ten cents, but begged him to
spend it for something to eat, and give me some, because it was all the
money I had, and I hadn't had nothing to eat since yesterday.  He never
said nothing.  The next minute he whirls on me and says:
Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us?  We'd skin him if he done
that!
How can he blow?  Hain't he run off?
No!  That old fool sold him, and never divided with me, and the money's
gone.
_Sold_ him?  I says, and begun to cry; why, he was _my_ nigger, and
that was my money.  Where is he?--I want my nigger.
Well, you can't _get_ your nigger, that's all--so dry up your
blubbering. Looky here--do you think _you'd_ venture to blow on us?
Blamed if I think I'd trust you.  Why, if you _was_ to blow on us--
He stopped, but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes
before. I went on a-whimpering, and says:
I don't want to blow on nobody; and I ain't got no time to blow, nohow.
I got to turn out and find my nigger.
He looked kinder bothered, and stood there with his bills fluttering on
his arm, thinking, and wrinkling up his forehead.  At last he says:
I'll tell you something.  We got to be here three days.  If you'll
promise you won't blow, and won't let the nigger blow, I'll tell you
where to find him.
So I promised, and he says:
A farmer by the name of Silas Ph-- and then he stopped.  You see, he
started to tell me the truth; but when he stopped that way, and begun to
study and think again, I reckoned he was changing his mind.  And so he
was. He wouldn't trust me; he wanted to make sure of having me out of
the way the whole three days.  So pretty soon he says:
The man that bought him is named Abram Foster--Abram G. Foster--and he
lives forty mile back here in the country, on the road to Lafayette.
All right, I says, I can walk it in three days.  And I'll start this
very afternoon.
No you wont, you'll start _now_; and don't you lose any time about it,
neither, nor do any gabbling by the way.  Just keep a tight tongue in
your head and move right along, and then you won't get into trouble with
_us_, d'ye hear?
That was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played for.  I
wanted to be left free to work my plans.
So clear out, he says; and you can tell Mr. Foster whatever you want
to. Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim _is_ your nigger--some
idiots don't require documents--leastways I've heard there's such down
South here.  And when you tell him the handbill and the reward's bogus,
maybe he'll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for
getting 'em out.  Go 'long now, and tell him anything you want to; but
mind you don't work your jaw any _between_ here and there.
So I left, and struck for the back country.  I didn't look around, but I
kinder felt like he was watching me.  But I knowed I could tire him out
at that.  I went straight out in the country as much as a mile before
I stopped; then I doubled back through the woods towards Phelps'.  I
reckoned I better start in on my plan straight off without fooling
around, because I wanted to stop Jim's mouth till these fellows could
get away.  I didn't want no trouble with their kind.  I'd seen all I
wanted to of them, and wanted to get entirely shut of them.
CHAPTER XXXII.
WHEN I got there it was all still and Sunday-like, and hot and sunshiny;
the hands was gone to the fields; and there was them kind of faint
dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and
like everybody's dead and gone; and if a breeze fans along and quivers
the leaves it makes you feel mournful, because you feel like it's
spirits whispering--spirits that's been dead ever so many years--and you
always think they're talking about _you_.  As a general thing it makes a
body wish _he_ was dead, too, and done with it all.
Phelps' was one of these little one-horse cotton plantations, and they
all look alike.  A rail fence round a two-acre yard; a stile made out
of logs sawed off and up-ended in steps, like barrels of a different
length, to climb over the fence with, and for the women to stand on when
they are going to jump on to a horse; some sickly grass-patches in the
big yard, but mostly it was bare and smooth, like an old hat with the
nap rubbed off; big double log-house for the white folks--hewed logs,
with the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar, and these mud-stripes
been whitewashed some time or another; round-log kitchen, with a big
broad, open but roofed passage joining it to the house; log smoke-house
back of the kitchen; three little log nigger-cabins in a row t'other
side the smoke-house; one little hut all by itself away down against
the back fence, and some outbuildings down a piece the other side;
ash-hopper and big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut; bench by
the kitchen door, with bucket of water and a gourd; hound asleep there
in the sun; more hounds asleep round about; about three shade trees away
off in a corner; some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place
by the fence; outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch; then
the cotton fields begins, and after the fields the woods.
I went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash-hopper, and
started for the kitchen.  When I got a little ways I heard the dim hum
of a spinning-wheel wailing along up and sinking along down again;
and then I knowed for certain I wished I was dead--for that _is_ the
lonesomest sound in the whole world.
I went right along, not fixing up any particular plan, but just trusting
to Providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come; for
I'd noticed that Providence always did put the right words in my mouth
if I left it alone.
When I got half-way, first one hound and then another got up and went
for me, and of course I stopped and faced them, and kept still.  And
such another powwow as they made!  In a quarter of a minute I was a kind
of a hub of a wheel, as you may say--spokes made out of dogs--circle of
fifteen of them packed together around me, with their necks and noses
stretched up towards me, a-barking and howling; and more a-coming; you
could see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres.
A nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rolling-pin in her
hand, singing out, Begone _you_ Tige! you Spot! begone sah! and she
fetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them howling,
and then the rest followed; and the next second half of them come back,
wagging their tails around me, and making friends with me.  There ain't
no harm in a hound, nohow.
And behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger
boys without anything on but tow-linen shirts, and they hung on to their
mother's gown, and peeped out from behind her at me, bashful, the way
they always do.  And here comes the white woman running from the house,
about forty-five or fifty year old, bareheaded, and her spinning-stick
in her hand; and behind her comes her little white children, acting the
same way the little niggers was doing.  She was smiling all over so she
could hardly stand--and says:
It's _you_, at last!--_ain't_ it?
I out with a Yes'm before I thought.
She grabbed me and hugged me tight; and then gripped me by both hands
and shook and shook; and the tears come in her eyes, and run down over;
and she couldn't seem to hug and shake enough, and kept saying, You
don't look as much like your mother as I reckoned you would; but law
sakes, I don't care for that, I'm so glad to see you!  Dear, dear, it
does seem like I could eat you up!  Children, it's your cousin Tom!--tell
him howdy.
But they ducked their heads, and put their fingers in their mouths, and
hid behind her.  So she run on:
Lize, hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right away--or did you get
your breakfast on the boat?
I said I had got it on the boat.  So then she started for the house,
leading me by the hand, and the children tagging after.  When we got
there she set me down in a split-bottomed chair, and set herself down on
a little low stool in front of me, holding both of my hands, and says:
Now I can have a _good_ look at you; and, laws-a-me, I've been hungry
for it a many and a many a time, all these long years, and it's come
at last! We been expecting you a couple of days and more.  What kep'
you?--boat get aground?
Yes'm--she--
Don't say yes'm--say Aunt Sally.  Where'd she get aground?
I didn't rightly know what to say, because I didn't know whether the
boat would be coming up the river or down.  But I go a good deal on
instinct; and my instinct said she would be coming up--from down towards
Orleans. That didn't help me much, though; for I didn't know the names
of bars down that way.  I see I'd got to invent a bar, or forget the
name of the one we got aground on--or--Now I struck an idea, and fetched
it out:
It warn't the grounding--that didn't keep us back but a little.  We
blowed out a cylinder-head.
Good gracious! anybody hurt?
No'm.  Killed a nigger.
Well, it's lucky; because sometimes people do get hurt.  Two years ago
last Christmas your uncle Silas was coming up from Newrleans on the old
Lally Rook, and she blowed out a cylinder-head and crippled a man.  And
I think he died afterwards.  He was a Baptist.  Your uncle Silas knowed
a family in Baton Rouge that knowed his people very well.  Yes, I
remember now, he _did_ die.  Mortification set in, and they had to
amputate him. But it didn't save him.  Yes, it was mortification--that
was it.  He turned blue all over, and died in the hope of a glorious
resurrection. They say he was a sight to look at.  Your uncle's been up
to the town every day to fetch you. And he's gone again, not more'n an
hour ago; he'll be back any minute now. You must a met him on the road,
didn't you?--oldish man, with a--
No, I didn't see nobody, Aunt Sally.  The boat landed just at daylight,
and I left my baggage on the wharf-boat and went looking around the town
and out a piece in the country, to put in the time and not get here too
soon; and so I come down the back way.
Who'd you give the baggage to?
Nobody.
Why, child, it 'll be stole!
Not where I hid it I reckon it won't, I says.
How'd you get your breakfast so early on the boat?
It was kinder thin ice, but I says:
The captain see me standing around, and told me I better have something
to eat before I went ashore; so he took me in the texas to the officers'
lunch, and give me all I wanted.
I was getting so uneasy I couldn't listen good.  I had my mind on the
children all the time; I wanted to get them out to one side and pump
them a little, and find out who I was.  But I couldn't get no show, Mrs.
Phelps kept it up and run on so.  Pretty soon she made the cold chills
streak all down my back, because she says:
But here we're a-running on this way, and you hain't told me a word
about Sis, nor any of them.  Now I'll rest my works a little, and you
start up yourn; just tell me _everything_--tell me all about 'm all every
one of 'm; and how they are, and what they're doing, and what they told
you to tell me; and every last thing you can think of.
Well, I see I was up a stump--and up it good.  Providence had stood by
me this fur all right, but I was hard and tight aground now.  I see it
warn't a bit of use to try to go ahead--I'd got to throw up my hand.  So
I says to myself, here's another place where I got to resk the truth.
I opened my mouth to begin; but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind
the bed, and says:
Here he comes!  Stick your head down lower--there, that'll do; you can't
be seen now.  Don't you let on you're here.  I'll play a joke on him.
Children, don't you say a word.
I see I was in a fix now.  But it warn't no use to worry; there warn't
nothing to do but just hold still, and try and be ready to stand from
under when the lightning struck.
I had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in; then
the bed hid him.  Mrs. Phelps she jumps for him, and says:
Has he come?
No, says her husband.
Good-_ness_ gracious! she says, what in the warld can have become of
him?
I can't imagine, says the old gentleman; and I must say it makes me
dreadful uneasy.
Uneasy! she says; I'm ready to go distracted!  He _must_ a come; and
you've missed him along the road.  I _know_ it's so--something tells me
so.
Why, Sally, I _couldn't_ miss him along the road--_you_ know that.
But oh, dear, dear, what _will_ Sis say!  He must a come!  You must a
missed him.  He--
Oh, don't distress me any more'n I'm already distressed.  I don't know
what in the world to make of it.  I'm at my wit's end, and I don't mind
acknowledging 't I'm right down scared.  But there's no hope that he's
come; for he _couldn't_ come and me miss him.  Sally, it's terrible--just
terrible--something's happened to the boat, sure!
Why, Silas!  Look yonder!--up the road!--ain't that somebody coming?
He sprung to the window at the head of the bed, and that give Mrs.
Phelps the chance she wanted.  She stooped down quick at the foot of the
bed and give me a pull, and out I come; and when he turned back from the
window there she stood, a-beaming and a-smiling like a house afire, and
I standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside.  The old gentleman stared,
and says:
Why, who's that?
Who do you reckon 't is?
I hain't no idea.  Who _is_ it?
It's _Tom Sawyer!_
By jings, I most slumped through the floor!  But there warn't no time to
swap knives; the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook, and kept on
shaking; and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and
cry; and then how they both did fire off questions about Sid, and Mary,
and the rest of the tribe.
But if they was joyful, it warn't nothing to what I was; for it was like
being born again, I was so glad to find out who I was.  Well, they froze
to me for two hours; and at last, when my chin was so tired it couldn't
hardly go any more, I had told them more about my family--I mean the
Sawyer family--than ever happened to any six Sawyer families.  And I
explained all about how we blowed out a cylinder-head at the mouth of
White River, and it took us three days to fix it.  Which was all right,
and worked first-rate; because _they_ didn't know but what it would take
three days to fix it.  If I'd a called it a bolthead it would a done
just as well.
Now I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side, and pretty
uncomfortable all up the other.  Being Tom Sawyer was easy and
comfortable, and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by I hear a
steamboat coughing along down the river.  Then I says to myself, s'pose
Tom Sawyer comes down on that boat?  And s'pose he steps in here any
minute, and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keep
quiet?
Well, I couldn't _have_ it that way; it wouldn't do at all.  I must go
up the road and waylay him.  So I told the folks I reckoned I would go
up to the town and fetch down my baggage.  The old gentleman was for
going along with me, but I said no, I could drive the horse myself, and
I druther he wouldn't take no trouble about me.
CHAPTER XXXIII.
SO I started for town in the wagon, and when I was half-way I see a
wagon coming, and sure enough it was Tom Sawyer, and I stopped and
waited till he come along.  I says Hold on! and it stopped alongside,
and his mouth opened up like a trunk, and stayed so; and he swallowed
two or three times like a person that's got a dry throat, and then says:
I hain't ever done you no harm.  You know that.  So, then, what you
want to come back and ha'nt _me_ for?
I says:
I hain't come back--I hain't been _gone_.
When he heard my voice it righted him up some, but he warn't quite
satisfied yet.  He says:
Don't you play nothing on me, because I wouldn't on you.  Honest injun
now, you ain't a ghost?
Honest injun, I ain't, I says.
Well--I--I--well, that ought to settle it, of course; but I can't somehow
seem to understand it no way.  Looky here, warn't you ever murdered _at
all?_
No.  I warn't ever murdered at all--I played it on them.  You come in
here and feel of me if you don't believe me.
So he done it; and it satisfied him; and he was that glad to see me
again he didn't know what to do.  And he wanted to know all about it
right off, because it was a grand adventure, and mysterious, and so it
hit him where he lived.  But I said, leave it alone till by and by; and
told his driver to wait, and we drove off a little piece, and I told
him the kind of a fix I was in, and what did he reckon we better do?  He
said, let him alone a minute, and don't disturb him.  So he thought and
thought, and pretty soon he says:
It's all right; I've got it.  Take my trunk in your wagon, and let on
it's your'n; and you turn back and fool along slow, so as to get to the
house about the time you ought to; and I'll go towards town a piece, and
take a fresh start, and get there a quarter or a half an hour after you;
and you needn't let on to know me at first.
I says:
All right; but wait a minute.  There's one more thing--a thing that
_nobody_ don't know but me.  And that is, there's a nigger here that
I'm a-trying to steal out of slavery, and his name is _Jim_--old Miss
Watson's Jim.
He says:
What!  Why, Jim is--
He stopped and went to studying.  I says:
I know what you'll say.  You'll say it's dirty, low-down business; but
what if it is?  I'm low down; and I'm a-going to steal him, and I want
you keep mum and not let on.  Will you?
His eye lit up, and he says:
I'll _help_ you steal him!
Well, I let go all holts then, like I was shot.  It was the most
astonishing speech I ever heard--and I'm bound to say Tom Sawyer fell
considerable in my estimation.  Only I couldn't believe it.  Tom Sawyer
a _nigger-stealer!_
Oh, shucks!  I says; you're joking.
I ain't joking, either.
Well, then, I says, joking or no joking, if you hear anything said
about a runaway nigger, don't forget to remember that _you_ don't know
nothing about him, and I don't know nothing about him.
Then we took the trunk and put it in my wagon, and he drove off his
way and I drove mine.  But of course I forgot all about driving slow on
accounts of being glad and full of thinking; so I got home a heap too
quick for that length of a trip.  The old gentleman was at the door, and
he says:
Why, this is wonderful!  Whoever would a thought it was in that mare
to do it?  I wish we'd a timed her.  And she hain't sweated a hair--not
a hair. It's wonderful.  Why, I wouldn't take a hundred dollars for that
horse now--I wouldn't, honest; and yet I'd a sold her for fifteen before,
and thought 'twas all she was worth.
That's all he said.  He was the innocentest, best old soul I ever see.
But it warn't surprising; because he warn't only just a farmer, he was
a preacher, too, and had a little one-horse log church down back of the
plantation, which he built it himself at his own expense, for a church
and schoolhouse, and never charged nothing for his preaching, and it was
worth it, too.  There was plenty other farmer-preachers like that, and
done the same way, down South.
In about half an hour Tom's wagon drove up to the front stile, and Aunt
Sally she see it through the window, because it was only about fifty
yards, and says:
Why, there's somebody come!  I wonder who 'tis?  Why, I do believe it's
a stranger.  Jimmy (that's one of the children) run and tell Lize to
put on another plate for dinner.
Everybody made a rush for the front door, because, of course, a stranger
don't come _every_ year, and so he lays over the yaller-fever, for
interest, when he does come.  Tom was over the stile and starting for
the house; the wagon was spinning up the road for the village, and we
was all bunched in the front door.  Tom had his store clothes on, and an
audience--and that was always nuts for Tom Sawyer.  In them circumstances
it warn't no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was
suitable.  He warn't a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep; no,
he come ca'm and important, like the ram.  When he got a-front of us he
lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty, like it was the lid of a box
that had butterflies asleep in it and he didn't want to disturb them,
and says:
Mr. Archibald Nichols, I presume?
No, my boy, says the old gentleman, I'm sorry to say 't your driver
has deceived you; Nichols's place is down a matter of three mile more.
Come in, come in.
Tom he took a look back over his shoulder, and says, Too late--he's out
of sight.
Yes, he's gone, my son, and you must come in and eat your dinner with
us; and then we'll hitch up and take you down to Nichols's.
Oh, I _can't_ make you so much trouble; I couldn't think of it.  I'll
walk--I don't mind the distance.
But we won't _let_ you walk--it wouldn't be Southern hospitality to do
it. Come right in.
Oh, _do_, says Aunt Sally; it ain't a bit of trouble to us, not a
bit in the world.  You must stay.  It's a long, dusty three mile, and
we can't let you walk.  And, besides, I've already told 'em to put on
another plate when I see you coming; so you mustn't disappoint us.  Come
right in and make yourself at home.
So Tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome, and let himself be
persuaded, and come in; and when he was in he said he was a stranger
from Hicksville, Ohio, and his name was William Thompson--and he made
another bow.
Well, he run on, and on, and on, making up stuff about Hicksville and
everybody in it he could invent, and I getting a little nervious, and
wondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape; and at last,
still talking along, he reached over and kissed Aunt Sally right on the
mouth, and then settled back again in his chair comfortable, and was
going on talking; but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of
her hand, and says:
You owdacious puppy!
He looked kind of hurt, and says:
I'm surprised at you, m'am.
You're s'rp--Why, what do you reckon I am?  I've a good notion to take
and--Say, what do you mean by kissing me?
He looked kind of humble, and says:
I didn't mean nothing, m'am.  I didn't mean no harm.  I--I--thought you'd
like it.
Why, you born fool!  She took up the spinning stick, and it looked
like it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it.
What made you think I'd like it?
Well, I don't know.  Only, they--they--told me you would.
_They_ told you I would.  Whoever told you's _another_ lunatic.  I
never heard the beat of it.  Who's _they_?
Why, everybody.  They all said so, m'am.
It was all she could do to hold in; and her eyes snapped, and her
fingers worked like she wanted to scratch him; and she says:
Who's 'everybody'?  Out with their names, or ther'll be an idiot
short.
He got up and looked distressed, and fumbled his hat, and says:
I'm sorry, and I warn't expecting it.  They told me to.  They all told
me to.  They all said, kiss her; and said she'd like it.  They all said
it--every one of them.  But I'm sorry, m'am, and I won't do it no more--I
won't, honest.
You won't, won't you?  Well, I sh'd _reckon_ you won't!
No'm, I'm honest about it; I won't ever do it again--till you ask me.
Till I _ask_ you!  Well, I never see the beat of it in my born days!
I lay you'll be the Methusalem-numskull of creation before ever I ask
you--or the likes of you.
Well, he says, it does surprise me so.  I can't make it out, somehow.
They said you would, and I thought you would.  But-- He stopped and
looked around slow, like he wished he could run across a friendly eye
somewheres, and fetched up on the old gentleman's, and says, Didn't
_you_ think she'd like me to kiss her, sir?
Why, no; I--I--well, no, I b'lieve I didn't.
Then he looks on around the same way to me, and says:
Tom, didn't _you_ think Aunt Sally 'd open out her arms and say, 'Sid
Sawyer--'
My land! she says, breaking in and jumping for him, you impudent
young rascal, to fool a body so-- and was going to hug him, but he
fended her off, and says:
No, not till you've asked me first.
So she didn't lose no time, but asked him; and hugged him and kissed
him over and over again, and then turned him over to the old man, and he
took what was left.  And after they got a little quiet again she says:
Why, dear me, I never see such a surprise.  We warn't looking for _you_
at all, but only Tom.  Sis never wrote to me about anybody coming but
him.
It's because it warn't _intended_ for any of us to come but Tom, he
says; but I begged and begged, and at the last minute she let me
come, too; so, coming down the river, me and Tom thought it would be a
first-rate surprise for him to come here to the house first, and for me
to by and by tag along and drop in, and let on to be a stranger.  But it
was a mistake, Aunt Sally.  This ain't no healthy place for a stranger
to come.
No--not impudent whelps, Sid.  You ought to had your jaws boxed; I
hain't been so put out since I don't know when.  But I don't care, I
don't mind the terms--I'd be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to
have you here. Well, to think of that performance!  I don't deny it, I
was most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smack.
We had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and
the kitchen; and there was things enough on that table for seven
families--and all hot, too; none of your flabby, tough meat that's laid
in a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of
old cold cannibal in the morning.  Uncle Silas he asked a pretty long
blessing over it, but it was worth it; and it didn't cool it a bit,
neither, the way I've seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times.
There was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon, and me
and Tom was on the lookout all the time; but it warn't no use, they
didn't happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger, and we was afraid
to try to work up to it.  But at supper, at night, one of the little
boys says:
Pa, mayn't Tom and Sid and me go to the show?
No, says the old man, I reckon there ain't going to be any; and you
couldn't go if there was; because the runaway nigger told Burton and
me all about that scandalous show, and Burton said he would tell the
people; so I reckon they've drove the owdacious loafers out of town
before this time.
So there it was!--but I couldn't help it.  Tom and me was to sleep in the
same room and bed; so, being tired, we bid good-night and went up to
bed right after supper, and clumb out of the window and down the
lightning-rod, and shoved for the town; for I didn't believe anybody was
going to give the king and the duke a hint, and so if I didn't hurry up
and give them one they'd get into trouble sure.
On the road Tom he told me all about how it was reckoned I was murdered,
and how pap disappeared pretty soon, and didn't come back no more, and
what a stir there was when Jim run away; and I told Tom all about our
Royal Nonesuch rapscallions, and as much of the raft voyage as I had
time to; and as we struck into the town and up through the the middle of
it--it was as much as half-after eight, then--here comes a raging rush of
people with torches, and an awful whooping and yelling, and banging tin
pans and blowing horns; and we jumped to one side to let them go by;
and as they went by I see they had the king and the duke astraddle of a
rail--that is, I knowed it _was_ the king and the duke, though they was
all over tar and feathers, and didn't look like nothing in the
world that was human--just looked like a couple of monstrous big
soldier-plumes.  Well, it made me sick to see it; and I was sorry for
them poor pitiful rascals, it seemed like I couldn't ever feel any
hardness against them any more in the world.  It was a dreadful thing to
see.  Human beings _can_ be awful cruel to one another.
We see we was too late--couldn't do no good.  We asked some stragglers
about it, and they said everybody went to the show looking very
innocent; and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the
middle of his cavortings on the stage; then somebody give a signal, and
the house rose up and went for them.
So we poked along back home, and I warn't feeling so brash as I was
before, but kind of ornery, and humble, and to blame, somehow--though
I hadn't done nothing.  But that's always the way; it don't make no
difference whether you do right or wrong, a person's conscience ain't
got no sense, and just goes for him anyway.  If I had a yaller dog that
didn't know no more than a person's conscience does I would pison him.
It takes up more room than all the rest of a person's insides, and yet
ain't no good, nohow.  Tom Sawyer he says the same.
CHAPTER XXXIV.
WE stopped talking, and got to thinking.  By and by Tom says:
Looky here, Huck, what fools we are to not think of it before!  I bet I
know where Jim is.
No!  Where?
In that hut down by the ash-hopper.  Why, looky here.  When we was at
dinner, didn't you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles?
Yes.
What did you think the vittles was for?
For a dog.
So 'd I. Well, it wasn't for a dog.
Why?
Because part of it was watermelon.
So it was--I noticed it.  Well, it does beat all that I never thought
about a dog not eating watermelon.  It shows how a body can see and
don't see at the same time.
Well, the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in, and he locked it
again when he came out.  He fetched uncle a key about the time we got up
from table--same key, I bet.  Watermelon shows man, lock shows prisoner;
and it ain't likely there's two prisoners on such a little plantation,
and where the people's all so kind and good.  Jim's the prisoner.  All
right--I'm glad we found it out detective fashion; I wouldn't give shucks
for any other way.  Now you work your mind, and study out a plan to
steal Jim, and I will study out one, too; and we'll take the one we like
the best.
What a head for just a boy to have!  If I had Tom Sawyer's head I
wouldn't trade it off to be a duke, nor mate of a steamboat, nor clown
in a circus, nor nothing I can think of.  I went to thinking out a plan,
but only just to be doing something; I knowed very well where the right
plan was going to come from.  Pretty soon Tom says:
Ready?
Yes, I says.
All right--bring it out.
My plan is this, I says.  We can easy find out if it's Jim in there.
Then get up my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my raft over from the
island.  Then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the
old man's britches after he goes to bed, and shove off down the river
on the raft with Jim, hiding daytimes and running nights, the way me and
Jim used to do before.  Wouldn't that plan work?
_Work_?  Why, cert'nly it would work, like rats a-fighting.  But it's
too blame' simple; there ain't nothing _to_ it.  What's the good of a
plan that ain't no more trouble than that?  It's as mild as goose-milk.
Why, Huck, it wouldn't make no more talk than breaking into a soap
factory.
I never said nothing, because I warn't expecting nothing different; but
I knowed mighty well that whenever he got _his_ plan ready it wouldn't
have none of them objections to it.
And it didn't.  He told me what it was, and I see in a minute it was
worth fifteen of mine for style, and would make Jim just as free a man
as mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides.  So I was satisfied,
and said we would waltz in on it.  I needn't tell what it was here,
because I knowed it wouldn't stay the way, it was.  I knowed he would be
changing it around every which way as we went along, and heaving in new
bullinesses wherever he got a chance.  And that is what he done.
Well, one thing was dead sure, and that was that Tom Sawyer was in
earnest, and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery.
That was the thing that was too many for me.  Here was a boy that was
respectable and well brung up; and had a character to lose; and folks at
home that had characters; and he was bright and not leather-headed; and
knowing and not ignorant; and not mean, but kind; and yet here he was,
without any more pride, or rightness, or feeling, than to stoop to
this business, and make himself a shame, and his family a shame,
before everybody.  I _couldn't_ understand it no way at all.  It was
outrageous, and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so; and so be
his true friend, and let him quit the thing right where he was and save
himself. And I _did_ start to tell him; but he shut me up, and says:
Don't you reckon I know what I'm about?  Don't I generly know what I'm
about?
Yes.
Didn't I _say_ I was going to help steal the nigger?
Yes.
_Well_, then.
That's all he said, and that's all I said.  It warn't no use to say any
more; because when he said he'd do a thing, he always done it.  But I
couldn't make out how he was willing to go into this thing; so I just
let it go, and never bothered no more about it.  If he was bound to have
it so, I couldn't help it.
When we got home the house was all dark and still; so we went on down to
the hut by the ash-hopper for to examine it.  We went through the yard
so as to see what the hounds would do.  They knowed us, and didn't make
no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by
in the night.  When we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and
the two sides; and on the side I warn't acquainted with--which was the
north side--we found a square window-hole, up tolerable high, with just
one stout board nailed across it.  I says:
Here's the ticket.  This hole's big enough for Jim to get through if we
wrench off the board.
Tom says:
It's as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and as easy as
playing hooky.  I should _hope_ we can find a way that's a little more
complicated than _that_, Huck Finn.
Well, then, I says, how 'll it do to saw him out, the way I done
before I was murdered that time?
That's more _like_, he says.  It's real mysterious, and troublesome,
and good, he says; but I bet we can find a way that's twice as long.
There ain't no hurry; le's keep on looking around.
Betwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to that
joined the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank.  It was as long
as the hut, but narrow--only about six foot wide.  The door to it was at
the south end, and was padlocked.  Tom he went to the soap-kettle and
searched around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with;
so he took it and prized out one of the staples.  The chain fell down,
and we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and struck a match,
and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn't no connection
with it; and there warn't no floor to the shed, nor nothing in it but
some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow.
The match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the staple again, and
the door was locked as good as ever. Tom was joyful.  He says;
Now we're all right.  We'll _dig_ him out.  It 'll take about a week!
Then we started for the house, and I went in the back door--you only have
to pull a buckskin latch-string, they don't fasten the doors--but that
warn't romantical enough for Tom Sawyer; no way would do him but he must
climb up the lightning-rod.  But after he got up half way about three
times, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time most
busted his brains out, he thought he'd got to give it up; but after he
was rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck, and this
time he made the trip.
In the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger cabins
to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jim--if it
_was_ Jim that was being fed.  The niggers was just getting through
breakfast and starting for the fields; and Jim's nigger was piling up
a tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the others was
leaving, the key come from the house.
This nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was
all tied up in little bunches with thread.  That was to keep witches
off.  He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, and
making him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of
strange words and noises, and he didn't believe he was ever witched so
long before in his life.  He got so worked up, and got to running on so
about his troubles, he forgot all about what he'd been a-going to do.
So Tom says:
What's the vittles for?  Going to feed the dogs?
The nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face, like when you
heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says:
Yes, Mars Sid, A dog.  Cur'us dog, too.  Does you want to go en look at
'im?
Yes.
I hunched Tom, and whispers:
You going, right here in the daybreak?  _that_ warn't the plan.
No, it warn't; but it's the plan _now_.
So, drat him, we went along, but I didn't like it much.  When we got in
we couldn't hardly see anything, it was so dark; but Jim was there, sure
enough, and could see us; and he sings out:
Why, _Huck_!  En good _lan_'! ain' dat Misto Tom?
I just knowed how it would be; I just expected it.  I didn't know
nothing to do; and if I had I couldn't a done it, because that nigger
busted in and says:
Why, de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen?
We could see pretty well now.  Tom he looked at the nigger, steady and
kind of wondering, and says:
Does _who_ know us?
Why, dis-yer runaway nigger.
I don't reckon he does; but what put that into your head?
What _put_ it dar?  Didn' he jis' dis minute sing out like he knowed
you?
Tom says, in a puzzled-up kind of way:
Well, that's mighty curious.  _Who_ sung out? _when_ did he sing out?
_what_ did he sing out? And turns to me, perfectly ca'm, and says,
Did _you_ hear anybody sing out?
Of course there warn't nothing to be said but the one thing; so I says:
No; I ain't heard nobody say nothing.
Then he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him before,
and says:
Did you sing out?
No, sah, says Jim; I hain't said nothing, sah.
Not a word?
No, sah, I hain't said a word.
Did you ever see us before?
No, sah; not as I knows on.
So Tom turns to the nigger, which was looking wild and distressed, and
says, kind of severe:
What do you reckon's the matter with you, anyway?  What made you think
somebody sung out?
Oh, it's de dad-blame' witches, sah, en I wisht I was dead, I do.
Dey's awluz at it, sah, en dey do mos' kill me, dey sk'yers me so.
Please to don't tell nobody 'bout it sah, er ole Mars Silas he'll scole
me; 'kase he say dey _ain't_ no witches.  I jis' wish to goodness he was
heah now--_den_ what would he say!  I jis' bet he couldn' fine no way to
git aroun' it _dis_ time.  But it's awluz jis' so; people dat's _sot_,
stays sot; dey won't look into noth'n'en fine it out f'r deyselves, en
when _you_ fine it out en tell um 'bout it, dey doan' b'lieve you.
Tom give him a dime, and said we wouldn't tell nobody; and told him to
buy some more thread to tie up his wool with; and then looks at Jim, and
says:
I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger.  If I was to
catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away, I wouldn't give
him up, I'd hang him.  And whilst the nigger stepped to the door to
look at the dime and bite it to see if it was good, he whispers to Jim
and says:
Don't ever let on to know us.  And if you hear any digging going on
nights, it's us; we're going to set you free.
Jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it; then the nigger
come back, and we said we'd come again some time if the nigger wanted
us to; and he said he would, more particular if it was dark, because the
witches went for him mostly in the dark, and it was good to have folks
around then.
CHAPTER XXXV.
IT would be most an hour yet till breakfast, so we left and struck down
into the woods; because Tom said we got to have _some_ light to see how
to dig by, and a lantern makes too much, and might get us into trouble;
what we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that's called
fox-fire, and just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a
dark place.  We fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds, and set down
to rest, and Tom says, kind of dissatisfied:
Blame it, this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be.
And so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan.
There ain't no watchman to be drugged--now there _ought_ to be a
watchman.  There ain't even a dog to give a sleeping-mixture to.  And
there's Jim chained by one leg, with a ten-foot chain, to the leg of his
bed:  why, all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off
the chain.  And Uncle Silas he trusts everybody; sends the key to the
punkin-headed nigger, and don't send nobody to watch the nigger.  Jim
could a got out of that window-hole before this, only there wouldn't be
no use trying to travel with a ten-foot chain on his leg.  Why, drat it,
Huck, it's the stupidest arrangement I ever see. You got to invent _all_
the difficulties.  Well, we can't help it; we got to do the best we can
with the materials we've got. Anyhow, there's one thing--there's more
honor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers,
where there warn't one of them furnished to you by the people who it was
their duty to furnish them, and you had to contrive them all out of your
own head.  Now look at just that one thing of the lantern.  When you
come down to the cold facts, we simply got to _let on_ that a lantern's
resky.  Why, we could work with a torchlight procession if we wanted to,
I believe.  Now, whilst I think of it, we got to hunt up something to
make a saw out of the first chance we get.
What do we want of a saw?
What do we _want_ of it?  Hain't we got to saw the leg of Jim's bed
off, so as to get the chain loose?
Why, you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain
off.
Well, if that ain't just like you, Huck Finn.  You _can_ get up the
infant-schooliest ways of going at a thing.  Why, hain't you ever read
any books at all?--Baron Trenck, nor Casanova, nor Benvenuto Chelleeny,
nor Henri IV., nor none of them heroes?  Who ever heard of getting a
prisoner loose in such an old-maidy way as that?  No; the way all the
best authorities does is to saw the bed-leg in two, and leave it just
so, and swallow the sawdust, so it can't be found, and put some dirt and
grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal can't see
no sign of it's being sawed, and thinks the bed-leg is perfectly sound.
Then, the night you're ready, fetch the leg a kick, down she goes; slip
off your chain, and there you are.  Nothing to do but hitch your
rope ladder to the battlements, shin down it, break your leg in the
moat--because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short, you know--and
there's your horses and your trusty vassles, and they scoop you up and
fling you across a saddle, and away you go to your native Langudoc, or
Navarre, or wherever it is. It's gaudy, Huck.  I wish there was a moat
to this cabin. If we get time, the night of the escape, we'll dig one.
I says:
What do we want of a moat when we're going to snake him out from under
the cabin?
But he never heard me.  He had forgot me and everything else.  He had
his chin in his hand, thinking.  Pretty soon he sighs and shakes his
head; then sighs again, and says:
No, it wouldn't do--there ain't necessity enough for it.
For what?  I says.
Why, to saw Jim's leg off, he says.
Good land!  I says; why, there ain't _no_ necessity for it.  And what
would you want to saw his leg off for, anyway?
Well, some of the best authorities has done it.  They couldn't get the
chain off, so they just cut their hand off and shoved.  And a leg would
be better still.  But we got to let that go.  There ain't necessity
enough in this case; and, besides, Jim's a nigger, and wouldn't
understand the reasons for it, and how it's the custom in Europe; so
we'll let it go.  But there's one thing--he can have a rope ladder; we
can tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough.  And we
can send it to him in a pie; it's mostly done that way.  And I've et
worse pies.
Why, Tom Sawyer, how you talk, I says; Jim ain't got no use for a
rope ladder.
He _has_ got use for it.  How _you_ talk, you better say; you don't
know nothing about it.  He's _got_ to have a rope ladder; they all do.
What in the nation can he _do_ with it?
_Do_ with it?  He can hide it in his bed, can't he?  That's what they
all do; and _he's_ got to, too.  Huck, you don't ever seem to want to do
anything that's regular; you want to be starting something fresh all the
time. S'pose he _don't_ do nothing with it? ain't it there in his bed,
for a clew, after he's gone? and don't you reckon they'll want clews?
Of course they will.  And you wouldn't leave them any?  That would be a
_pretty_ howdy-do, _wouldn't_ it!  I never heard of such a thing.
Well, I says, if it's in the regulations, and he's got to have
it, all right, let him have it; because I don't wish to go back on no
regulations; but there's one thing, Tom Sawyer--if we go to tearing up
our sheets to make Jim a rope ladder, we're going to get into trouble
with Aunt Sally, just as sure as you're born.  Now, the way I look at
it, a hickry-bark ladder don't cost nothing, and don't waste nothing,
and is just as good to load up a pie with, and hide in a straw tick,
as any rag ladder you can start; and as for Jim, he ain't had no
experience, and so he don't care what kind of a--
Oh, shucks, Huck Finn, if I was as ignorant as you I'd keep
still--that's what I'D do.  Who ever heard of a state prisoner escaping
by a hickry-bark ladder?  Why, it's perfectly ridiculous.
Well, all right, Tom, fix it your own way; but if you'll take my
advice, you'll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline.
He said that would do.  And that gave him another idea, and he says:
Borrow a shirt, too.
What do we want of a shirt, Tom?
Want it for Jim to keep a journal on.
Journal your granny--_Jim_ can't write.
S'pose he _can't_ write--he can make marks on the shirt, can't he, if
we make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron
barrel-hoop?
Why, Tom, we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better
one; and quicker, too.
_Prisoners_ don't have geese running around the donjon-keep to pull
pens out of, you muggins.  They _always_ make their pens out of the
hardest, toughest, troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or
something like that they can get their hands on; and it takes them weeks
and weeks and months and months to file it out, too, because they've got
to do it by rubbing it on the wall.  _They_ wouldn't use a goose-quill
if they had it. It ain't regular.
Well, then, what'll we make him the ink out of?
Many makes it out of iron-rust and tears; but that's the common sort
and women; the best authorities uses their own blood.  Jim can do that;
and when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious message
to let the world know where he's captivated, he can write it on the
bottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window.  The
Iron Mask always done that, and it's a blame' good way, too.
Jim ain't got no tin plates.  They feed him in a pan.
That ain't nothing; we can get him some.
Can't nobody _read_ his plates.
That ain't got anything to _do_ with it, Huck Finn.  All _he's_ got to
do is to write on the plate and throw it out.  You don't _have_ to be
able to read it. Why, half the time you can't read anything a prisoner
writes on a tin plate, or anywhere else.
Well, then, what's the sense in wasting the plates?
Why, blame it all, it ain't the _prisoner's_ plates.
But it's _somebody's_ plates, ain't it?
Well, spos'n it is?  What does the _prisoner_ care whose--
He broke off there, because we heard the breakfast-horn blowing.  So we
cleared out for the house.
Along during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the
clothes-line; and I found an old sack and put them in it, and we went
down and got the fox-fire, and put that in too.  I called it borrowing,
because that was what pap always called it; but Tom said it warn't
borrowing, it was stealing.  He said we was representing prisoners; and
prisoners don't care how they get a thing so they get it, and nobody
don't blame them for it, either.  It ain't no crime in a prisoner to
steal the thing he needs to get away with, Tom said; it's his right; and
so, as long as we was representing a prisoner, we had a perfect right to
steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves
out of prison with.  He said if we warn't prisoners it would be a very
different thing, and nobody but a mean, ornery person would steal when
he warn't a prisoner.  So we allowed we would steal everything there was
that come handy.  And yet he made a mighty fuss, one day, after that,
when I stole a watermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it; and he
made me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it
was for. Tom said that what he meant was, we could steal anything we
_needed_. Well, I says, I needed the watermelon.  But he said I didn't
need it to get out of prison with; there's where the difference was.
He said if I'd a wanted it to hide a knife in, and smuggle it to Jim
to kill the seneskal with, it would a been all right.  So I let it go at
that, though I couldn't see no advantage in my representing a prisoner
if I got to set down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like
that every time I see a chance to hog a watermelon.
Well, as I was saying, we waited that morning till everybody was settled
down to business, and nobody in sight around the yard; then Tom he
carried the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keep
watch.  By and by he come out, and we went and set down on the woodpile
to talk.  He says:
Everything's all right now except tools; and that's easy fixed.
Tools?  I says.
Yes.
Tools for what?
Why, to dig with.  We ain't a-going to _gnaw_ him out, are we?
Ain't them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a
nigger out with?  I says.
He turns on me, looking pitying enough to make a body cry, and says:
Huck Finn, did you _ever_ hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels,
and all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with?
Now I want to ask you--if you got any reasonableness in you at all--what
kind of a show would _that_ give him to be a hero?  Why, they might as
well lend him the key and done with it.  Picks and shovels--why, they
wouldn't furnish 'em to a king.
Well, then, I says, if we don't want the picks and shovels, what do
we want?
A couple of case-knives.
To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?
Yes.
Confound it, it's foolish, Tom.
It don't make no difference how foolish it is, it's the _right_ way--and
it's the regular way.  And there ain't no _other_ way, that ever I heard
of, and I've read all the books that gives any information about these
things. They always dig out with a case-knife--and not through dirt, mind
you; generly it's through solid rock.  And it takes them weeks and weeks
and weeks, and for ever and ever.  Why, look at one of them prisoners in
the bottom dungeon of the Castle Deef, in the harbor of Marseilles, that
dug himself out that way; how long was _he_ at it, you reckon?
I don't know.
Well, guess.
I don't know.  A month and a half.
_Thirty-seven year_--and he come out in China.  _That's_ the kind.  I
wish the bottom of _this_ fortress was solid rock.
_Jim_ don't know nobody in China.
What's _that_ got to do with it?  Neither did that other fellow.  But
you're always a-wandering off on a side issue.  Why can't you stick to
the main point?
All right--I don't care where he comes out, so he _comes_ out; and Jim
don't, either, I reckon.  But there's one thing, anyway--Jim's too old to
be dug out with a case-knife.  He won't last.
Yes he will _last_, too.  You don't reckon it's going to take
thirty-seven years to dig out through a _dirt_ foundation, do you?
How long will it take, Tom?
Well, we can't resk being as long as we ought to, because it mayn't
take very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New Orleans.
He'll hear Jim ain't from there.  Then his next move will be to
advertise Jim, or something like that.  So we can't resk being as long
digging him out as we ought to.  By rights I reckon we ought to be
a couple of years; but we can't.  Things being so uncertain, what I
recommend is this:  that we really dig right in, as quick as we can;
and after that, we can _let on_, to ourselves, that we was at it
thirty-seven years.  Then we can snatch him out and rush him away the
first time there's an alarm.  Yes, I reckon that 'll be the best way.
Now, there's _sense_ in that, I says.  Letting on don't cost nothing;
letting on ain't no trouble; and if it's any object, I don't mind
letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year.  It wouldn't strain
me none, after I got my hand in.  So I'll mosey along now, and smouch a
couple of case-knives.
Smouch three, he says; we want one to make a saw out of.
Tom, if it ain't unregular and irreligious to sejest it, I says,
there's an old rusty saw-blade around yonder sticking under the
weather-boarding behind the smoke-house.
He looked kind of weary and discouraged-like, and says:
It ain't no use to try to learn you nothing, Huck.  Run along and
smouch the knives--three of them.  So I done it.
CHAPTER XXXVI.
AS soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the
lightning-rod, and shut ourselves up in the lean-to, and got out our
pile of fox-fire, and went to work.  We cleared everything out of the
way, about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log.  Tom
said he was right behind Jim's bed now, and we'd dig in under it, and
when we got through there couldn't nobody in the cabin ever know there
was any hole there, because Jim's counter-pin hung down most to the
ground, and you'd have to raise it up and look under to see the hole.
So we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight; and then
we was dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you couldn't see
we'd done anything hardly.  At last I says:
This ain't no thirty-seven year job; this is a thirty-eight year job,
Tom Sawyer.
He never said nothing.  But he sighed, and pretty soon he stopped
digging, and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking.
Then he says:
It ain't no use, Huck, it ain't a-going to work.  If we was prisoners
it would, because then we'd have as many years as we wanted, and no
hurry; and we wouldn't get but a few minutes to dig, every day, while
they was changing watches, and so our hands wouldn't get blistered, and
we could keep it up right along, year in and year out, and do it right,
and the way it ought to be done.  But _we_ can't fool along; we got to
rush; we ain't got no time to spare.  If we was to put in another
night this way we'd have to knock off for a week to let our hands get
well--couldn't touch a case-knife with them sooner.
Well, then, what we going to do, Tom?
I'll tell you.  It ain't right, and it ain't moral, and I wouldn't like
it to get out; but there ain't only just the one way:  we got to dig him
out with the picks, and _let on_ it's case-knives.
_Now_ you're _talking_!  I says; your head gets leveler and leveler
all the time, Tom Sawyer, I says.  Picks is the thing, moral or no
moral; and as for me, I don't care shucks for the morality of it, nohow.
When I start in to steal a nigger, or a watermelon, or a Sunday-school
book, I ain't no ways particular how it's done so it's done.  What I
want is my nigger; or what I want is my watermelon; or what I want is my
Sunday-school book; and if a pick's the handiest thing, that's the thing
I'm a-going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that Sunday-school
book out with; and I don't give a dead rat what the authorities thinks
about it nuther.
Well, he says, there's excuse for picks and letting-on in a case like
this; if it warn't so, I wouldn't approve of it, nor I wouldn't stand by
and see the rules broke--because right is right, and wrong is wrong,
and a body ain't got no business doing wrong when he ain't ignorant and
knows better.  It might answer for _you_ to dig Jim out with a pick,
_without_ any letting on, because you don't know no better; but it
wouldn't for me, because I do know better.  Gimme a case-knife.
He had his own by him, but I handed him mine.  He flung it down, and
says:
Gimme a _case-knife_.
I didn't know just what to do--but then I thought.  I scratched around
amongst the old tools, and got a pickaxe and give it to him, and he took
it and went to work, and never said a word.
He was always just that particular.  Full of principle.
So then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shoveled, turn about,
and made the fur fly.  We stuck to it about a half an hour, which was as
long as we could stand up; but we had a good deal of a hole to show for
it. When I got up stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom doing
his level best with the lightning-rod, but he couldn't come it, his
hands was so sore.  At last he says:
It ain't no use, it can't be done.  What you reckon I better do?  Can't
you think of no way?
Yes, I says, but I reckon it ain't regular.  Come up the stairs, and
let on it's a lightning-rod.
So he done it.
Next day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house,
for to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow candles; and I
hung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance, and stole three tin
plates.  Tom says it wasn't enough; but I said nobody wouldn't ever see
the plates that Jim throwed out, because they'd fall in the dog-fennel
and jimpson weeds under the window-hole--then we could tote them back and
he could use them over again.  So Tom was satisfied.  Then he says:
Now, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to Jim.
Take them in through the hole, I says, when we get it done.
He only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody ever heard
of such an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying.  By and by he
said he had ciphered out two or three ways, but there warn't no need to
decide on any of them yet.  Said we'd got to post Jim first.
That night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and took
one of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heard
Jim snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didn't wake him.  Then we
whirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a half
the job was done.  We crept in under Jim's bed and into the cabin, and
pawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim awhile,
and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up gentle
and gradual.  He was so glad to see us he most cried; and called us
honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for having us
hunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away,
and clearing out without losing any time.  But Tom he showed him how
unregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans,
and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; and
not to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, _sure_.
So Jim he said it was all right, and we set there and talked over old
times awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of questions, and when Jim told
him Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him, and Aunt
Sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat, and
both of them was kind as they could be, Tom says:
_Now_ I know how to fix it.  We'll send you some things by them.
I said, Don't do nothing of the kind; it's one of the most jackass
ideas I ever struck; but he never paid no attention to me; went right
on.  It was his way when he'd got his plans set.
So he told Jim how we'd have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and other
large things by Nat, the nigger that fed him, and he must be on the
lookout, and not be surprised, and not let Nat see him open them; and
we would put small things in uncle's coat-pockets and he must steal them
out; and we would tie things to aunt's apron-strings or put them in her
apron-pocket, if we got a chance; and told him what they would be and
what they was for.  And told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with
his blood, and all that. He told him everything.  Jim he couldn't see
no sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was white folks and knowed
better than him; so he was satisfied, and said he would do it all just
as Tom said.
Jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good
sociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to
bed, with hands that looked like they'd been chawed.  Tom was in high
spirits. He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and the
most intellectural; and said if he only could see his way to it we would
keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children to
get out; for he believed Jim would come to like it better and better the
more he got used to it.  He said that in that way it could be strung out
to as much as eighty year, and would be the best time on record.  And he
said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it.
In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass
candlestick into handy sizes, and Tom put them and the pewter spoon in
his pocket.  Then we went to the nigger cabins, and while I got Nat's
notice off, Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a
corn-pone that was in Jim's pan, and we went along with Nat to see how
it would work, and it just worked noble; when Jim bit into it it most
mashed all his teeth out; and there warn't ever anything could a worked
better. Tom said so himself. Jim he never let on but what it was only
just a piece of rock or something like that that's always getting into
bread, you know; but after that he never bit into nothing but what he
jabbed his fork into it in three or four places first.
And whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light, here comes a
couple of the hounds bulging in from under Jim's bed; and they kept on
piling in till there was eleven of them, and there warn't hardly room
in there to get your breath.  By jings, we forgot to fasten that lean-to
door!  The nigger Nat he only just hollered Witches once, and keeled
over on to the floor amongst the dogs, and begun to groan like he was
dying.  Tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of Jim's meat,
and the dogs went for it, and in two seconds he was out himself and back
again and shut the door, and I knowed he'd fixed the other door too.
Then he went to work on the nigger, coaxing him and petting him, and
asking him if he'd been imagining he saw something again.  He raised up,
and blinked his eyes around, and says:
Mars Sid, you'll say I's a fool, but if I didn't b'lieve I see most a
million dogs, er devils, er some'n, I wisht I may die right heah in dese
tracks.  I did, mos' sholy.  Mars Sid, I _felt_ um--I _felt_ um, sah; dey
was all over me.  Dad fetch it, I jis' wisht I could git my han's on one
er dem witches jis' wunst--on'y jis' wunst--it's all I'd ast.  But mos'ly
I wisht dey'd lemme 'lone, I does.
Tom says:
Well, I tell you what I think.  What makes them come here just at this
runaway nigger's breakfast-time?  It's because they're hungry; that's
the reason.  You make them a witch pie; that's the thing for _you_ to
do.
But my lan', Mars Sid, how's I gwyne to make 'm a witch pie?  I doan'
know how to make it.  I hain't ever hearn er sich a thing b'fo'.
Well, then, I'll have to make it myself.
Will you do it, honey?--will you?  I'll wusshup de groun' und' yo' foot,
I will!
All right, I'll do it, seeing it's you, and you've been good to us and
showed us the runaway nigger.  But you got to be mighty careful.  When
we come around, you turn your back; and then whatever we've put in the
pan, don't you let on you see it at all.  And don't you look when Jim
unloads the pan--something might happen, I don't know what.  And above
all, don't you _handle_ the witch-things.
_Hannel 'M_, Mars Sid?  What _is_ you a-talkin' 'bout?  I wouldn'
lay de weight er my finger on um, not f'r ten hund'd thous'n billion
dollars, I wouldn't.
CHAPTER XXXVII.
THAT was all fixed.  So then we went away and went to the rubbage-pile
in the back yard, where they keep the old boots, and rags, and pieces
of bottles, and wore-out tin things, and all such truck, and scratched
around and found an old tin washpan, and stopped up the holes as well as
we could, to bake the pie in, and took it down cellar and stole it full
of flour and started for breakfast, and found a couple of shingle-nails
that Tom said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his name and
sorrows on the dungeon walls with, and dropped one of them in Aunt
Sally's apron-pocket which was hanging on a chair, and t'other we stuck
in the band of Uncle Silas's hat, which was on the bureau, because we
heard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway nigger's
house this morning, and then went to breakfast, and Tom dropped the
pewter spoon in Uncle Silas's coat-pocket, and Aunt Sally wasn't come
yet, so we had to wait a little while.
And when she come she was hot and red and cross, and couldn't hardly
wait for the blessing; and then she went to sluicing out coffee with one
hand and cracking the handiest child's head with her thimble with the
other, and says:
I've hunted high and I've hunted low, and it does beat all what _has_
become of your other shirt.
My heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things, and a hard
piece of corn-crust started down my throat after it and got met on the
road with a cough, and was shot across the table, and took one of the
children in the eye and curled him up like a fishing-worm, and let a cry
out of him the size of a warwhoop, and Tom he turned kinder blue around
the gills, and it all amounted to a considerable state of things for
about a quarter of a minute or as much as that, and I would a sold out
for half price if there was a bidder.  But after that we was all right
again--it was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold.
Uncle Silas he says:
It's most uncommon curious, I can't understand it.  I know perfectly
well I took it _off_, because--
Because you hain't got but one _on_.  Just _listen_ at the man!  I know
you took it off, and know it by a better way than your wool-gethering
memory, too, because it was on the clo's-line yesterday--I see it there
myself. But it's gone, that's the long and the short of it, and you'll
just have to change to a red flann'l one till I can get time to make a
new one. And it 'll be the third I've made in two years.  It just keeps
a body on the jump to keep you in shirts; and whatever you do manage to
_do_ with 'm all is more'n I can make out.  A body 'd think you _would_
learn to take some sort of care of 'em at your time of life.
I know it, Sally, and I do try all I can.  But it oughtn't to be
altogether my fault, because, you know, I don't see them nor have
nothing to do with them except when they're on me; and I don't believe
I've ever lost one of them _off_ of me.
Well, it ain't _your_ fault if you haven't, Silas; you'd a done it
if you could, I reckon.  And the shirt ain't all that's gone, nuther.
Ther's a spoon gone; and _that_ ain't all.  There was ten, and now
ther's only nine. The calf got the shirt, I reckon, but the calf never
took the spoon, _that's_ certain.
Why, what else is gone, Sally?
Ther's six _candles_ gone--that's what.  The rats could a got the
candles, and I reckon they did; I wonder they don't walk off with the
whole place, the way you're always going to stop their holes and don't
do it; and if they warn't fools they'd sleep in your hair, Silas--_you'd_
never find it out; but you can't lay the _spoon_ on the rats, and that I
know.
Well, Sally, I'm in fault, and I acknowledge it; I've been remiss; but
I won't let to-morrow go by without stopping up them holes.
Oh, I wouldn't hurry; next year 'll do.  Matilda Angelina Araminta
_Phelps!_
Whack comes the thimble, and the child snatches her claws out of the
sugar-bowl without fooling around any.  Just then the nigger woman steps
on to the passage, and says:
Missus, dey's a sheet gone.
A _sheet_ gone!  Well, for the land's sake!
I'll stop up them holes to-day, says Uncle Silas, looking sorrowful.
Oh, _do_ shet up!--s'pose the rats took the _sheet_?  _where's_ it gone,
Lize?
Clah to goodness I hain't no notion, Miss' Sally.  She wuz on de
clo'sline yistiddy, but she done gone:  she ain' dah no mo' now.
I reckon the world _is_ coming to an end.  I _never_ see the beat of it
in all my born days.  A shirt, and a sheet, and a spoon, and six can--
Missus, comes a young yaller wench, dey's a brass cannelstick
miss'n.
Cler out from here, you hussy, er I'll take a skillet to ye!
Well, she was just a-biling.  I begun to lay for a chance; I reckoned
I would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated.  She
kept a-raging right along, running her insurrection all by herself, and
everybody else mighty meek and quiet; and at last Uncle Silas, looking
kind of foolish, fishes up that spoon out of his pocket.  She stopped,
with her mouth open and her hands up; and as for me, I wished I was in
Jeruslem or somewheres. But not long, because she says:
It's _just_ as I expected.  So you had it in your pocket all the time;
and like as not you've got the other things there, too.  How'd it get
there?
I reely don't know, Sally, he says, kind of apologizing, or you know
I would tell.  I was a-studying over my text in Acts Seventeen before
breakfast, and I reckon I put it in there, not noticing, meaning to put
my Testament in, and it must be so, because my Testament ain't in; but
I'll go and see; and if the Testament is where I had it, I'll know I
didn't put it in, and that will show that I laid the Testament down and
took up the spoon, and--
Oh, for the land's sake!  Give a body a rest!  Go 'long now, the whole
kit and biling of ye; and don't come nigh me again till I've got back my
peace of mind.
I'D a heard her if she'd a said it to herself, let alone speaking it
out; and I'd a got up and obeyed her if I'd a been dead.  As we was
passing through the setting-room the old man he took up his hat, and the
shingle-nail fell out on the floor, and he just merely picked it up and
laid it on the mantel-shelf, and never said nothing, and went out.  Tom
see him do it, and remembered about the spoon, and says:
Well, it ain't no use to send things by _him_ no more, he ain't
reliable. Then he says:  But he done us a good turn with the spoon,
anyway, without knowing it, and so we'll go and do him one without _him_
knowing it--stop up his rat-holes.
There was a noble good lot of them down cellar, and it took us a whole
hour, but we done the job tight and good and shipshape.  Then we heard
steps on the stairs, and blowed out our light and hid; and here comes
the old man, with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in t'other,
looking as absent-minded as year before last.  He went a mooning around,
first to one rat-hole and then another, till he'd been to them all.
Then he stood about five minutes, picking tallow-drip off of his candle
and thinking.  Then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairs,
saying:
Well, for the life of me I can't remember when I done it.  I could
show her now that I warn't to blame on account of the rats.  But never
mind--let it go.  I reckon it wouldn't do no good.
And so he went on a-mumbling up stairs, and then we left.  He was a
mighty nice old man.  And always is.
Tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon, but he said
we'd got to have it; so he took a think.  When he had ciphered it out
he told me how we was to do; then we went and waited around the
spoon-basket till we see Aunt Sally coming, and then Tom went to
counting the spoons and laying them out to one side, and I slid one of
them up my sleeve, and Tom says:
Why, Aunt Sally, there ain't but nine spoons _yet_.
She says:
Go 'long to your play, and don't bother me.  I know better, I counted
'm myself.
Well, I've counted them twice, Aunty, and I can't make but nine.
She looked out of all patience, but of course she come to count--anybody
would.
I declare to gracious ther' _ain't_ but nine! she says.  Why, what in
the world--plague _take_ the things, I'll count 'm again.
So I slipped back the one I had, and when she got done counting, she
says:
Hang the troublesome rubbage, ther's _ten_ now! and she looked huffy
and bothered both.  But Tom says:
Why, Aunty, I don't think there's ten.
You numskull, didn't you see me _count 'm?_
I know, but--
Well, I'll count 'm _again_.
So I smouched one, and they come out nine, same as the other time.
Well, she _was_ in a tearing way--just a-trembling all over, she was so
mad.  But she counted and counted till she got that addled she'd start
to count in the basket for a spoon sometimes; and so, three times they
come out right, and three times they come out wrong.  Then she grabbed
up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat
galley-west; and she said cle'r out and let her have some peace, and if
we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she'd skin
us.  So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her apron-pocket whilst
she was a-giving us our sailing orders, and Jim got it all right, along
with her shingle nail, before noon.  We was very well satisfied with
this business, and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took,
because he said _now_ she couldn't ever count them spoons twice alike
again to save her life; and wouldn't believe she'd counted them right if
she _did_; and said that after she'd about counted her head off for the
next three days he judged she'd give it up and offer to kill anybody
that wanted her to ever count them any more.
So we put the sheet back on the line that night, and stole one out of
her closet; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a
couple of days till she didn't know how many sheets she had any more,
and she didn't _care_, and warn't a-going to bullyrag the rest of her
soul out about it, and wouldn't count them again not to save her life;
she druther die first.
So we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon
and the candles, by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up
counting; and as to the candlestick, it warn't no consequence, it would
blow over by and by.
But that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie.  We
fixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got it
done at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and we
had to use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through, and
we got burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out with
the smoke; because, you see, we didn't want nothing but a crust, and we
couldn't prop it up right, and she would always cave in.  But of course
we thought of the right way at last--which was to cook the ladder, too,
in the pie.  So then we laid in with Jim the second night, and tore
up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together, and long
before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person
with.  We let on it took nine months to make it.
And in the forenoon we took it down to the woods, but it wouldn't go
into the pie.  Being made of a whole sheet, that way, there was rope
enough for forty pies if we'd a wanted them, and plenty left over
for soup, or sausage, or anything you choose.  We could a had a whole
dinner.
But we didn't need it.  All we needed was just enough for the pie, and
so we throwed the rest away.  We didn't cook none of the pies in the
wash-pan--afraid the solder would melt; but Uncle Silas he had a noble
brass warming-pan which he thought considerable of, because it belonged
to one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over from
England with William the Conqueror in the Mayflower or one of them early
ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and things
that was valuable, not on account of being any account, because they
warn't, but on account of them being relicts, you know, and we snaked
her out, private, and took her down there, but she failed on the first
pies, because we didn't know how, but she come up smiling on the last
one.  We took and lined her with dough, and set her in the coals, and
loaded her up with rag rope, and put on a dough roof, and shut down the
lid, and put hot embers on top, and stood off five foot, with the long
handle, cool and comfortable, and in fifteen minutes she turned out a
pie that was a satisfaction to look at. But the person that et it would
want to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along, for if that rope
ladder wouldn't cramp him down to business I don't know nothing what I'm
talking about, and lay him in enough stomach-ache to last him till next
time, too.
Nat didn't look when we put the witch pie in Jim's pan; and we put the
three tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles; and so Jim
got everything all right, and as soon as he was by himself he busted
into the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick,
and scratched some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the
window-hole.
CHAPTER XXXVIII.
MAKING them pens was a distressid tough job, and so was the saw; and Jim
allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all.  That's the
one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall.  But he had to have
it; Tom said he'd _got_ to; there warn't no case of a state prisoner not
scrabbling his inscription to leave behind, and his coat of arms.
Look at Lady Jane Grey, he says; look at Gilford Dudley; look at old
Northumberland!  Why, Huck, s'pose it _is_ considerble trouble?--what
you going to do?--how you going to get around it?  Jim's _got_ to do his
inscription and coat of arms.  They all do.
Jim says:
Why, Mars Tom, I hain't got no coat o' arm; I hain't got nuffn but dish
yer ole shirt, en you knows I got to keep de journal on dat.
Oh, you don't understand, Jim; a coat of arms is very different.
Well, I says, Jim's right, anyway, when he says he ain't got no coat
of arms, because he hain't.
I reckon I knowed that, Tom says, but you bet he'll have one before
he goes out of this--because he's going out _right_, and there ain't
going to be no flaws in his record.
So whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece, Jim
a-making his'n out of the brass and I making mine out of the spoon,
Tom set to work to think out the coat of arms.  By and by he said he'd
struck so many good ones he didn't hardly know which to take, but there
was one which he reckoned he'd decide on.  He says:
On the scutcheon we'll have a bend _or_ in the dexter base, a saltire
_murrey_ in the fess, with a dog, couchant, for common charge, and under
his foot a chain embattled, for slavery, with a chevron _vert_ in a
chief engrailed, and three invected lines on a field _azure_, with the
nombril points rampant on a dancette indented; crest, a runaway nigger,
_sable_, with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister; and a
couple of gules for supporters, which is you and me; motto, _Maggiore
Fretta, Minore Otto._  Got it out of a book--means the more haste the
less speed.
Geewhillikins, I says, but what does the rest of it mean?
We ain't got no time to bother over that, he says; we got to dig in
like all git-out.
Well, anyway, I says, what's _some_ of it?  What's a fess?
A fess--a fess is--_you_ don't need to know what a fess is.  I'll show
him how to make it when he gets to it.
Shucks, Tom, I says, I think you might tell a person.  What's a bar
sinister?
Oh, I don't know.  But he's got to have it.  All the nobility does.
That was just his way.  If it didn't suit him to explain a thing to you,
he wouldn't do it.  You might pump at him a week, it wouldn't make no
difference.
He'd got all that coat of arms business fixed, so now he started in to
finish up the rest of that part of the work, which was to plan out a
mournful inscription--said Jim got to have one, like they all done.  He
made up a lot, and wrote them out on a paper, and read them off, so:
1.  Here a captive heart busted. 2.  Here a poor prisoner, forsook by
the world and friends, fretted his sorrowful life. 3.  Here a lonely
heart broke, and a worn spirit went to its rest, after thirty-seven
years of solitary captivity. 4.  Here, homeless and friendless, after
thirty-seven years of bitter captivity, perished a noble stranger,
natural son of Louis XIV.
Tom's voice trembled whilst he was reading them, and he most broke down.
When he got done he couldn't no way make up his mind which one for Jim
to scrabble on to the wall, they was all so good; but at last he allowed
he would let him scrabble them all on.  Jim said it would take him a
year to scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a nail, and he
didn't know how to make letters, besides; but Tom said he would block
them out for him, and then he wouldn't have nothing to do but just
follow the lines.  Then pretty soon he says:
Come to think, the logs ain't a-going to do; they don't have log walls
in a dungeon:  we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock.  We'll fetch
a rock.
Jim said the rock was worse than the logs; he said it would take him
such a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldn't ever get out.
But Tom said he would let me help him do it.  Then he took a look to
see how me and Jim was getting along with the pens.  It was most pesky
tedious hard work and slow, and didn't give my hands no show to get
well of the sores, and we didn't seem to make no headway, hardly; so Tom
says:
I know how to fix it.  We got to have a rock for the coat of arms and
mournful inscriptions, and we can kill two birds with that same rock.
There's a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill, and we'll smouch it,
and carve the things on it, and file out the pens and the saw on it,
too.
It warn't no slouch of an idea; and it warn't no slouch of a grindstone
nuther; but we allowed we'd tackle it.  It warn't quite midnight yet,
so we cleared out for the mill, leaving Jim at work.  We smouched the
grindstone, and set out to roll her home, but it was a most nation tough
job. Sometimes, do what we could, we couldn't keep her from falling
over, and she come mighty near mashing us every time.  Tom said she was
going to get one of us, sure, before we got through.  We got her half
way; and then we was plumb played out, and most drownded with sweat.  We
see it warn't no use; we got to go and fetch Jim. So he raised up his
bed and slid the chain off of the bed-leg, and wrapt it round and round
his neck, and we crawled out through our hole and down there, and Jim
and me laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing; and
Tom superintended.  He could out-superintend any boy I ever see.  He
knowed how to do everything.
Our hole was pretty big, but it warn't big enough to get the grindstone
through; but Jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough.  Then Tom
marked out them things on it with the nail, and set Jim to work on them,
with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the
lean-to for a hammer, and told him to work till the rest of his candle
quit on him, and then he could go to bed, and hide the grindstone under
his straw tick and sleep on it.  Then we helped him fix his chain back
on the bed-leg, and was ready for bed ourselves.  But Tom thought of
something, and says:
You got any spiders in here, Jim?
No, sah, thanks to goodness I hain't, Mars Tom.
All right, we'll get you some.
But bless you, honey, I doan' _want_ none.  I's afeard un um.  I jis'
's soon have rattlesnakes aroun'.
Tom thought a minute or two, and says:
It's a good idea.  And I reckon it's been done.  It _must_ a been done;
it stands to reason.  Yes, it's a prime good idea.  Where could you keep
it?
Keep what, Mars Tom?
Why, a rattlesnake.
De goodness gracious alive, Mars Tom!  Why, if dey was a rattlesnake to
come in heah I'd take en bust right out thoo dat log wall, I would, wid
my head.
Why, Jim, you wouldn't be afraid of it after a little.  You could tame
it.
_Tame_ it!
Yes--easy enough.  Every animal is grateful for kindness and petting,
and they wouldn't _think_ of hurting a person that pets them.  Any book
will tell you that.  You try--that's all I ask; just try for two or three
days. Why, you can get him so, in a little while, that he'll love you;
and sleep with you; and won't stay away from you a minute; and will let
you wrap him round your neck and put his head in your mouth.
_Please_, Mars Tom--_doan_' talk so!  I can't _stan_' it!  He'd _let_
me shove his head in my mouf--fer a favor, hain't it?  I lay he'd wait a
pow'ful long time 'fo' I _ast_ him.  En mo' en dat, I doan' _want_ him
to sleep wid me.
Jim, don't act so foolish.  A prisoner's _got_ to have some kind of a
dumb pet, and if a rattlesnake hain't ever been tried, why, there's more
glory to be gained in your being the first to ever try it than any other
way you could ever think of to save your life.
Why, Mars Tom, I doan' _want_ no sich glory.  Snake take 'n bite
Jim's chin off, den _whah_ is de glory?  No, sah, I doan' want no sich
doin's.
Blame it, can't you _try_?  I only _want_ you to try--you needn't keep
it up if it don't work.
But de trouble all _done_ ef de snake bite me while I's a tryin' him.
Mars Tom, I's willin' to tackle mos' anything 'at ain't onreasonable,
but ef you en Huck fetches a rattlesnake in heah for me to tame, I's
gwyne to _leave_, dat's _shore_.
Well, then, let it go, let it go, if you're so bull-headed about it.
We can get you some garter-snakes, and you can tie some buttons on
their tails, and let on they're rattlesnakes, and I reckon that 'll have
to do.
I k'n stan' _dem_, Mars Tom, but blame' 'f I couldn' get along widout
um, I tell you dat.  I never knowed b'fo' 't was so much bother and
trouble to be a prisoner.
Well, it _always_ is when it's done right.  You got any rats around
here?
No, sah, I hain't seed none.
Well, we'll get you some rats.
Why, Mars Tom, I doan' _want_ no rats.  Dey's de dadblamedest creturs
to 'sturb a body, en rustle roun' over 'im, en bite his feet, when he's
tryin' to sleep, I ever see.  No, sah, gimme g'yarter-snakes, 'f I's
got to have 'm, but doan' gimme no rats; I hain' got no use f'r um,
skasely.
But, Jim, you _got_ to have 'em--they all do.  So don't make no more
fuss about it.  Prisoners ain't ever without rats.  There ain't no
instance of it.  And they train them, and pet them, and learn them
tricks, and they get to be as sociable as flies.  But you got to play
music to them.  You got anything to play music on?
I ain' got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o' paper, en a juice-harp;
but I reck'n dey wouldn' take no stock in a juice-harp.
Yes they would _they_ don't care what kind of music 'tis.  A
jews-harp's plenty good enough for a rat.  All animals like music--in a
prison they dote on it.  Specially, painful music; and you can't get no
other kind out of a jews-harp.  It always interests them; they come out
to see what's the matter with you.  Yes, you're all right; you're fixed
very well.  You want to set on your bed nights before you go to sleep,
and early in the mornings, and play your jews-harp; play 'The Last Link
is Broken'--that's the thing that 'll scoop a rat quicker 'n anything
else; and when you've played about two minutes you'll see all the rats,
and the snakes, and spiders, and things begin to feel worried about you,
and come.  And they'll just fairly swarm over you, and have a noble good
time.
Yes, _dey_ will, I reck'n, Mars Tom, but what kine er time is _Jim_
havin'? Blest if I kin see de pint.  But I'll do it ef I got to.  I
reck'n I better keep de animals satisfied, en not have no trouble in de
house.
Tom waited to think it over, and see if there wasn't nothing else; and
pretty soon he says:
Oh, there's one thing I forgot.  Could you raise a flower here, do you
reckon?
I doan know but maybe I could, Mars Tom; but it's tolable dark in heah,
en I ain' got no use f'r no flower, nohow, en she'd be a pow'ful sight
o' trouble.
Well, you try it, anyway.  Some other prisoners has done it.
One er dem big cat-tail-lookin' mullen-stalks would grow in heah, Mars
Tom, I reck'n, but she wouldn't be wuth half de trouble she'd coss.
Don't you believe it.  We'll fetch you a little one and you plant it in
the corner over there, and raise it.  And don't call it mullen, call it
Pitchiola--that's its right name when it's in a prison.  And you want to
water it with your tears.
Why, I got plenty spring water, Mars Tom.
You don't _want_ spring water; you want to water it with your tears.
It's the way they always do.
Why, Mars Tom, I lay I kin raise one er dem mullen-stalks twyste wid
spring water whiles another man's a _start'n_ one wid tears.
That ain't the idea.  You _got_ to do it with tears.
She'll die on my han's, Mars Tom, she sholy will; kase I doan' skasely
ever cry.
So Tom was stumped.  But he studied it over, and then said Jim would
have to worry along the best he could with an onion.  He promised
he would go to the nigger cabins and drop one, private, in Jim's
coffee-pot, in the morning. Jim said he would jis' 's soon have
tobacker in his coffee; and found so much fault with it, and with the
work and bother of raising the mullen, and jews-harping the rats, and
petting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things, on top of
all the other work he had to do on pens, and inscriptions, and journals,
and things, which made it more trouble and worry and responsibility to
be a prisoner than anything he ever undertook, that Tom most lost all
patience with him; and said he was just loadened down with more gaudier
chances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name for
himself, and yet he didn't know enough to appreciate them, and they was
just about wasted on him.  So Jim he was sorry, and said he wouldn't
behave so no more, and then me and Tom shoved for bed.
CHAPTER XXXIX.
IN the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat-trap and
fetched it down, and unstopped the best rat-hole, and in about an hour
we had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones; and then we took it and put
it in a safe place under Aunt Sally's bed.  But while we was gone for
spiders little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps found
it there, and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out,
and they did; and Aunt Sally she come in, and when we got back she was
a-standing on top of the bed raising Cain, and the rats was doing what
they could to keep off the dull times for her.  So she took and dusted
us both with the hickry, and we was as much as two hours catching
another fifteen or sixteen, drat that meddlesome cub, and they warn't
the likeliest, nuther, because the first haul was the pick of the flock.
I never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was.
We got a splendid stock of sorted spiders, and bugs, and frogs, and
caterpillars, and one thing or another; and we like to got a hornet's
nest, but we didn't.  The family was at home.  We didn't give it right
up, but stayed with them as long as we could; because we allowed we'd
tire them out or they'd got to tire us out, and they done it.  Then we
got allycumpain and rubbed on the places, and was pretty near all right
again, but couldn't set down convenient.  And so we went for the snakes,
and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes, and put them in
a bag, and put it in our room, and by that time it was supper-time, and
a rattling good honest day's work:  and hungry?--oh, no, I reckon not!
And there warn't a blessed snake up there when we went back--we didn't
half tie the sack, and they worked out somehow, and left.  But it didn't
matter much, because they was still on the premises somewheres.  So
we judged we could get some of them again.  No, there warn't no real
scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell.  You'd see
them dripping from the rafters and places every now and then; and they
generly landed in your plate, or down the back of your neck, and most
of the time where you didn't want them.  Well, they was handsome and
striped, and there warn't no harm in a million of them; but that never
made no difference to Aunt Sally; she despised snakes, be the breed what
they might, and she couldn't stand them no way you could fix it; and
every time one of them flopped down on her, it didn't make no difference
what she was doing, she would just lay that work down and light out.  I
never see such a woman.  And you could hear her whoop to Jericho.  You
couldn't get her to take a-holt of one of them with the tongs.  And if
she turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a
howl that you would think the house was afire.  She disturbed the old
man so that he said he could most wish there hadn't ever been no snakes
created.  Why, after every last snake had been gone clear out of the
house for as much as a week Aunt Sally warn't over it yet; she warn't
near over it; when she was setting thinking about something you could
touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump
right out of her stockings.  It was very curious.  But Tom said all
women was just so.  He said they was made that way for some reason or
other.
We got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way, and she
allowed these lickings warn't nothing to what she would do if we ever
loaded up the place again with them.  I didn't mind the lickings,
because they didn't amount to nothing; but I minded the trouble we
had to lay in another lot.  But we got them laid in, and all the other
things; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim's was when they'd
all swarm out for music and go for him.  Jim didn't like the spiders,
and the spiders didn't like Jim; and so they'd lay for him, and make it
mighty warm for him.  And he said that between the rats and the snakes
and the grindstone there warn't no room in bed for him, skasely; and
when there was, a body couldn't sleep, it was so lively, and it was
always lively, he said, because _they_ never all slept at one time, but
took turn about, so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck, and
when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch, so he always had one
gang under him, in his way, and t'other gang having a circus over him,
and if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance at
him as he crossed over. He said if he ever got out this time he wouldn't
ever be a prisoner again, not for a salary.
Well, by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape.
The shirt was sent in early, in a pie, and every time a rat bit Jim he
would get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh;
the pens was made, the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the
grindstone; the bed-leg was sawed in two, and we had et up the sawdust,
and it give us a most amazing stomach-ache.  We reckoned we was all
going to die, but didn't.  It was the most undigestible sawdust I ever
see; and Tom said the same.
But as I was saying, we'd got all the work done now, at last; and we was
all pretty much fagged out, too, but mainly Jim.  The old man had wrote
a couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to come and get their
runaway nigger, but hadn't got no answer, because there warn't no such
plantation; so he allowed he would advertise Jim in the St. Louis and
New Orleans papers; and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones it give me
the cold shivers, and I see we hadn't no time to lose. So Tom said, now
for the nonnamous letters.
What's them?  I says.
Warnings to the people that something is up.  Sometimes it's done one
way, sometimes another.  But there's always somebody spying around that
gives notice to the governor of the castle.  When Louis XVI. was going
to light out of the Tooleries, a servant-girl done it.  It's a very good
way, and so is the nonnamous letters.  We'll use them both.  And it's
usual for the prisoner's mother to change clothes with him, and she
stays in, and he slides out in her clothes.  We'll do that, too.
But looky here, Tom, what do we want to _warn_ anybody for that
something's up?  Let them find it out for themselves--it's their
lookout.
Yes, I know; but you can't depend on them.  It's the way they've acted
from the very start--left us to do _everything_.  They're so confiding
and mullet-headed they don't take notice of nothing at all.  So if we
don't _give_ them notice there won't be nobody nor nothing to interfere
with us, and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape 'll go
off perfectly flat; won't amount to nothing--won't be nothing _to_ it.
Well, as for me, Tom, that's the way I'd like.
Shucks! he says, and looked disgusted.  So I says:
But I ain't going to make no complaint.  Any way that suits you suits
me. What you going to do about the servant-girl?
You'll be her.  You slide in, in the middle of the night, and hook that
yaller girl's frock.
Why, Tom, that 'll make trouble next morning; because, of course, she
prob'bly hain't got any but that one.
I know; but you don't want it but fifteen minutes, to carry the
nonnamous letter and shove it under the front door.
All right, then, I'll do it; but I could carry it just as handy in my
own togs.
You wouldn't look like a servant-girl _then_, would you?
No, but there won't be nobody to see what I look like, _anyway_.
That ain't got nothing to do with it.  The thing for us to do is just
to do our _duty_, and not worry about whether anybody _sees_ us do it or
not. Hain't you got no principle at all?
All right, I ain't saying nothing; I'm the servant-girl.  Who's Jim's
mother?
I'm his mother.  I'll hook a gown from Aunt Sally.
Well, then, you'll have to stay in the cabin when me and Jim leaves.
Not much.  I'll stuff Jim's clothes full of straw and lay it on his bed
to represent his mother in disguise, and Jim 'll take the nigger woman's
gown off of me and wear it, and we'll all evade together.  When a
prisoner of style escapes it's called an evasion.  It's always called
so when a king escapes, f'rinstance.  And the same with a king's son;
it don't make no difference whether he's a natural one or an unnatural
one.
So Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter, and I smouched the yaller wench's
frock that night, and put it on, and shoved it under the front door, the
way Tom told me to.  It said:
Beware.  Trouble is brewing.  Keep a sharp lookout. _Unknown_ _Friend_.
Next night we stuck a picture, which Tom drawed in blood, of a skull and
crossbones on the front door; and next night another one of a coffin on
the back door.  I never see a family in such a sweat.  They couldn't a
been worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying for them
behind everything and under the beds and shivering through the air.  If
a door banged, Aunt Sally she jumped and said ouch! if anything fell,
she jumped and said ouch! if you happened to touch her, when she
warn't noticing, she done the same; she couldn't face noway and be
satisfied, because she allowed there was something behind her every
time--so she was always a-whirling around sudden, and saying ouch, and
before she'd got two-thirds around she'd whirl back again, and say it
again; and she was afraid to go to bed, but she dasn't set up.  So the
thing was working very well, Tom said; he said he never see a thing work
more satisfactory. He said it showed it was done right.
So he said, now for the grand bulge!  So the very next morning at the
streak of dawn we got another letter ready, and was wondering what we
better do with it, because we heard them say at supper they was going
to have a nigger on watch at both doors all night.  Tom he went down the
lightning-rod to spy around; and the nigger at the back door was asleep,
and he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back.  This letter
said:
Don't betray me, I wish to be your friend.  There is a desprate gang of
cutthroats from over in the Indian Territory going to steal your runaway
nigger to-night, and they have been trying to scare you so as you will
stay in the house and not bother them.  I am one of the gang, but have
got religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again, and
will betray the helish design. They will sneak down from northards,
along the fence, at midnight exact, with a false key, and go in the
nigger's cabin to get him. I am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn
if I see any danger; but stead of that I will _baa_ like a sheep soon as
they get in and not blow at all; then whilst they are getting his
chains loose, you slip there and lock them in, and can kill them at your
leasure.  Don't do anything but just the way I am telling you, if you do
they will suspicion something and raise whoop-jamboreehoo. I do not wish
any reward but to know I have done the right thing. _Unknown Friend._
CHAPTER XL.
WE was feeling pretty good after breakfast, and took my canoe and went
over the river a-fishing, with a lunch, and had a good time, and took a
look at the raft and found her all right, and got home late to supper,
and found them in such a sweat and worry they didn't know which end they
was standing on, and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done
supper, and wouldn't tell us what the trouble was, and never let on a
word about the new letter, but didn't need to, because we knowed as much
about it as anybody did, and as soon as we was half up stairs and her
back was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good
lunch and took it up to our room and went to bed, and got up about
half-past eleven, and Tom put on Aunt Sally's dress that he stole and
was going to start with the lunch, but says:
Where's the butter?
I laid out a hunk of it, I says, on a piece of a corn-pone.
Well, you _left_ it laid out, then--it ain't here.
We can get along without it, I says.
We can get along _with_ it, too, he says; just you slide down cellar
and fetch it.  And then mosey right down the lightning-rod and come
along. I'll go and stuff the straw into Jim's clothes to represent his
mother in disguise, and be ready to _baa_ like a sheep and shove soon as
you get there.
So out he went, and down cellar went I. The hunk of butter, big as
a person's fist, was where I had left it, so I took up the slab of
corn-pone with it on, and blowed out my light, and started up stairs
very stealthy, and got up to the main floor all right, but here comes
Aunt Sally with a candle, and I clapped the truck in my hat, and clapped
my hat on my head, and the next second she see me; and she says:
You been down cellar?
Yes'm.
What you been doing down there?
Noth'n.
_Noth'n!_
No'm.
Well, then, what possessed you to go down there this time of night?
I don't know 'm.
You don't _know_?  Don't answer me that way. Tom, I want to know what
you been _doing_ down there.
I hain't been doing a single thing, Aunt Sally, I hope to gracious if I
have.
I reckoned she'd let me go now, and as a generl thing she would; but I
s'pose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat
about every little thing that warn't yard-stick straight; so she says,
very decided:
You just march into that setting-room and stay there till I come.  You
been up to something you no business to, and I lay I'll find out what it
is before I'M done with you.
So she went away as I opened the door and walked into the setting-room.
My, but there was a crowd there!  Fifteen farmers, and every one of them
had a gun.  I was most powerful sick, and slunk to a chair and set down.
They was setting around, some of them talking a little, in a low voice,
and all of them fidgety and uneasy, but trying to look like they warn't;
but I knowed they was, because they was always taking off their hats,
and putting them on, and scratching their heads, and changing their
seats, and fumbling with their buttons.  I warn't easy myself, but I
didn't take my hat off, all the same.
I did wish Aunt Sally would come, and get done with me, and lick me, if
she wanted to, and let me get away and tell Tom how we'd overdone this
thing, and what a thundering hornet's-nest we'd got ourselves into, so
we could stop fooling around straight off, and clear out with Jim before
these rips got out of patience and come for us.
At last she come and begun to ask me questions, but I _couldn't_ answer
them straight, I didn't know which end of me was up; because these men
was in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right NOW and
lay for them desperadoes, and saying it warn't but a few minutes to
midnight; and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the
sheep-signal; and here was Aunty pegging away at the questions, and
me a-shaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks I was
that scared; and the place getting hotter and hotter, and the butter
beginning to melt and run down my neck and behind my ears; and pretty
soon, when one of them says, I'M for going and getting in the cabin
_first_ and right _now_, and catching them when they come, I most
dropped; and a streak of butter come a-trickling down my forehead, and
Aunt Sally she see it, and turns white as a sheet, and says:
For the land's sake, what _is_ the matter with the child?  He's got the
brain-fever as shore as you're born, and they're oozing out!
And everybody runs to see, and she snatches off my hat, and out comes
the bread and what was left of the butter, and she grabbed me, and
hugged me, and says:
Oh, what a turn you did give me! and how glad and grateful I am it
ain't no worse; for luck's against us, and it never rains but it pours,
and when I see that truck I thought we'd lost you, for I knowed by
the color and all it was just like your brains would be if--Dear,
dear, whyd'nt you _tell_ me that was what you'd been down there for, I
wouldn't a cared.  Now cler out to bed, and don't lemme see no more of
you till morning!
I was up stairs in a second, and down the lightning-rod in another one,
and shinning through the dark for the lean-to.  I couldn't hardly get my
words out, I was so anxious; but I told Tom as quick as I could we must
jump for it now, and not a minute to lose--the house full of men, yonder,
with guns!
His eyes just blazed; and he says:
No!--is that so?  _ain't_ it bully!  Why, Huck, if it was to do over
again, I bet I could fetch two hundred!  If we could put it off till--
Hurry!  _Hurry_!  I says.  Where's Jim?
Right at your elbow; if you reach out your arm you can touch him.
He's dressed, and everything's ready.  Now we'll slide out and give the
sheep-signal.
But then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door, and heard them
begin to fumble with the pad-lock, and heard a man say:
I _told_ you we'd be too soon; they haven't come--the door is locked.
Here, I'll lock some of you into the cabin, and you lay for 'em in the
dark and kill 'em when they come; and the rest scatter around a piece,
and listen if you can hear 'em coming.
So in they come, but couldn't see us in the dark, and most trod on
us whilst we was hustling to get under the bed.  But we got under all
right, and out through the hole, swift but soft--Jim first, me next,
and Tom last, which was according to Tom's orders.  Now we was in the
lean-to, and heard trampings close by outside.  So we crept to the door,
and Tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack, but couldn't make
out nothing, it was so dark; and whispered and said he would listen
for the steps to get further, and when he nudged us Jim must glide out
first, and him last.  So he set his ear to the crack and listened, and
listened, and listened, and the steps a-scraping around out there all
the time; and at last he nudged us, and we slid out, and stooped down,
not breathing, and not making the least noise, and slipped stealthy
towards the fence in Injun file, and got to it all right, and me and Jim
over it; but Tom's britches catched fast on a splinter on the top
rail, and then he hear the steps coming, so he had to pull loose, which
snapped the splinter and made a noise; and as he dropped in our tracks
and started somebody sings out:
Who's that?  Answer, or I'll shoot!
But we didn't answer; we just unfurled our heels and shoved.  Then there
was a rush, and a _Bang, Bang, Bang!_ and the bullets fairly whizzed
around us! We heard them sing out:
Here they are!  They've broke for the river!  After 'em, boys, and turn
loose the dogs!
So here they come, full tilt.  We could hear them because they wore
boots and yelled, but we didn't wear no boots and didn't yell.  We was
in the path to the mill; and when they got pretty close on to us we
dodged into the bush and let them go by, and then dropped in behind
them.  They'd had all the dogs shut up, so they wouldn't scare off the
robbers; but by this time somebody had let them loose, and here they
come, making powwow enough for a million; but they was our dogs; so we
stopped in our tracks till they catched up; and when they see it warn't
nobody but us, and no excitement to offer them, they only just said
howdy, and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering; and
then we up-steam again, and whizzed along after them till we was nearly
to the mill, and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was
tied, and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the
river, but didn't make no more noise than we was obleeged to. Then we
struck out, easy and comfortable, for the island where my raft was; and
we could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down the
bank, till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out.  And when
we stepped on to the raft I says:
_Now_, old Jim, you're a free man again, and I bet you won't ever be a
slave no more.
En a mighty good job it wuz, too, Huck.  It 'uz planned beautiful, en
it 'uz done beautiful; en dey ain't _nobody_ kin git up a plan dat's mo'
mixed-up en splendid den what dat one wuz.
We was all glad as we could be, but Tom was the gladdest of all because
he had a bullet in the calf of his leg.
When me and Jim heard that we didn't feel so brash as what we did
before. It was hurting him considerable, and bleeding; so we laid him in
the wigwam and tore up one of the duke's shirts for to bandage him, but
he says:
Gimme the rags; I can do it myself.  Don't stop now; don't fool around
here, and the evasion booming along so handsome; man the sweeps, and set
her loose!  Boys, we done it elegant!--'deed we did.  I wish _we'd_ a
had the handling of Louis XVI., there wouldn't a been no 'Son of Saint
Louis, ascend to heaven!' wrote down in _his_ biography; no, sir, we'd
a whooped him over the _border_--that's what we'd a done with _him_--and
done it just as slick as nothing at all, too.  Man the sweeps--man the
sweeps!
But me and Jim was consulting--and thinking.  And after we'd thought a
minute, I says:
Say it, Jim.
So he says:
Well, den, dis is de way it look to me, Huck.  Ef it wuz _him_ dat 'uz
bein' sot free, en one er de boys wuz to git shot, would he say, 'Go on
en save me, nemmine 'bout a doctor f'r to save dis one?'  Is dat like
Mars Tom Sawyer?  Would he say dat?  You _bet_ he wouldn't!  _well_,
den, is _Jim_ gywne to say it?  No, sah--I doan' budge a step out'n dis
place 'dout a _doctor_, not if it's forty year!
I knowed he was white inside, and I reckoned he'd say what he did say--so
it was all right now, and I told Tom I was a-going for a doctor.
He raised considerable row about it, but me and Jim stuck to it and
wouldn't budge; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose
himself; but we wouldn't let him.  Then he give us a piece of his mind,
but it didn't do no good.
So when he sees me getting the canoe ready, he says:
Well, then, if you're bound to go, I'll tell you the way to do when you
get to the village.  Shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and
fast, and make him swear to be silent as the grave, and put a purse
full of gold in his hand, and then take and lead him all around the
back alleys and everywheres in the dark, and then fetch him here in the
canoe, in a roundabout way amongst the islands, and search him and take
his chalk away from him, and don't give it back to him till you get him
back to the village, or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it
again. It's the way they all do.
So I said I would, and left, and Jim was to hide in the woods when he
see the doctor coming till he was gone again.
CHAPTER XLI.
THE doctor was an old man; a very nice, kind-looking old man when I got
him up.  I told him me and my brother was over on Spanish Island hunting
yesterday afternoon, and camped on a piece of a raft we found, and about
midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams, for it went off and
shot him in the leg, and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and
not say nothing about it, nor let anybody know, because we wanted to
come home this evening and surprise the folks.
Who is your folks? he says.
The Phelpses, down yonder.
Oh, he says.  And after a minute, he says:
How'd you say he got shot?
He had a dream, I says, and it shot him.
Singular dream, he says.
So he lit up his lantern, and got his saddle-bags, and we started.  But
when he sees the canoe he didn't like the look of her--said she was big
enough for one, but didn't look pretty safe for two.  I says:
Oh, you needn't be afeard, sir, she carried the three of us easy
enough.
What three?
Why, me and Sid, and--and--and _the guns_; that's what I mean.
Oh, he says.
But he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her, and shook his head,
and said he reckoned he'd look around for a bigger one.  But they was
all locked and chained; so he took my canoe, and said for me to wait
till he come back, or I could hunt around further, or maybe I better
go down home and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to.  But
I said I didn't; so I told him just how to find the raft, and then he
started.
I struck an idea pretty soon.  I says to myself, spos'n he can't fix
that leg just in three shakes of a sheep's tail, as the saying is?
spos'n it takes him three or four days?  What are we going to do?--lay
around there till he lets the cat out of the bag?  No, sir; I know what
_I'll_ do.  I'll wait, and when he comes back if he says he's got to
go any more I'll get down there, too, if I swim; and we'll take and tie
him, and keep him, and shove out down the river; and when Tom's done
with him we'll give him what it's worth, or all we got, and then let him
get ashore.
So then I crept into a lumber-pile to get some sleep; and next time I
waked up the sun was away up over my head!  I shot out and went for the
doctor's house, but they told me he'd gone away in the night some time
or other, and warn't back yet.  Well, thinks I, that looks powerful bad
for Tom, and I'll dig out for the island right off.  So away I shoved,
and turned the corner, and nearly rammed my head into Uncle Silas's
stomach! He says:
Why, _Tom!_  Where you been all this time, you rascal?
I hain't been nowheres, I says, only just hunting for the runaway
nigger--me and Sid.
Why, where ever did you go? he says.  Your aunt's been mighty
uneasy.
She needn't, I says, because we was all right.  We followed the men
and the dogs, but they outrun us, and we lost them; but we thought we
heard them on the water, so we got a canoe and took out after them and
crossed over, but couldn't find nothing of them; so we cruised along
up-shore till we got kind of tired and beat out; and tied up the canoe
and went to sleep, and never waked up till about an hour ago; then we
paddled over here to hear the news, and Sid's at the post-office to see
what he can hear, and I'm a-branching out to get something to eat for
us, and then we're going home.
So then we went to the post-office to get Sid; but just as I
suspicioned, he warn't there; so the old man he got a letter out of the
office, and we waited awhile longer, but Sid didn't come; so the old man
said, come along, let Sid foot it home, or canoe it, when he got done
fooling around--but we would ride.  I couldn't get him to let me stay
and wait for Sid; and he said there warn't no use in it, and I must come
along, and let Aunt Sally see we was all right.
When we got home Aunt Sally was that glad to see me she laughed and
cried both, and hugged me, and give me one of them lickings of hern that
don't amount to shucks, and said she'd serve Sid the same when he come.
And the place was plum full of farmers and farmers' wives, to dinner;
and such another clack a body never heard.  Old Mrs. Hotchkiss was the
worst; her tongue was a-going all the time.  She says:
Well, Sister Phelps, I've ransacked that-air cabin over, an' I b'lieve
the nigger was crazy.  I says to Sister Damrell--didn't I, Sister
Damrell?--s'I, he's crazy, s'I--them's the very words I said.  You all
hearn me: he's crazy, s'I; everything shows it, s'I.  Look at that-air
grindstone, s'I; want to tell _me_'t any cretur 't's in his right mind
's a goin' to scrabble all them crazy things onto a grindstone, s'I?
Here sich 'n' sich a person busted his heart; 'n' here so 'n' so
pegged along for thirty-seven year, 'n' all that--natcherl son o' Louis
somebody, 'n' sich everlast'n rubbage.  He's plumb crazy, s'I; it's what
I says in the fust place, it's what I says in the middle, 'n' it's what
I says last 'n' all the time--the nigger's crazy--crazy 's Nebokoodneezer,
s'I.
An' look at that-air ladder made out'n rags, Sister Hotchkiss, says
old Mrs. Damrell; what in the name o' goodness _could_ he ever want
of--
The very words I was a-sayin' no longer ago th'n this minute to Sister
Utterback, 'n' she'll tell you so herself.  Sh-she, look at that-air rag
ladder, sh-she; 'n' s'I, yes, _look_ at it, s'I--what _could_ he a-wanted
of it, s'I.  Sh-she, Sister Hotchkiss, sh-she--
But how in the nation'd they ever _git_ that grindstone _in_ there,
_anyway_? 'n' who dug that-air _hole_? 'n' who--
My very _words_, Brer Penrod!  I was a-sayin'--pass that-air sasser o'
m'lasses, won't ye?--I was a-sayin' to Sister Dunlap, jist this minute,
how _did_ they git that grindstone in there, s'I.  Without _help_, mind
you--'thout _help_!  _that's_ wher 'tis.  Don't tell _me_, s'I; there
_wuz_ help, s'I; 'n' ther' wuz a _plenty_ help, too, s'I; ther's ben a
_dozen_ a-helpin' that nigger, 'n' I lay I'd skin every last nigger on
this place but _I'd_ find out who done it, s'I; 'n' moreover, s'I--
A _dozen_ says you!--_forty_ couldn't a done every thing that's been
done. Look at them case-knife saws and things, how tedious they've been
made; look at that bed-leg sawed off with 'm, a week's work for six men;
look at that nigger made out'n straw on the bed; and look at--
You may _well_ say it, Brer Hightower!  It's jist as I was a-sayin'
to Brer Phelps, his own self.  S'e, what do _you_ think of it, Sister
Hotchkiss, s'e? Think o' what, Brer Phelps, s'I?  Think o' that bed-leg
sawed off that a way, s'e?  _think_ of it, s'I?  I lay it never sawed
_itself_ off, s'I--somebody _sawed_ it, s'I; that's my opinion, take it
or leave it, it mayn't be no 'count, s'I, but sich as 't is, it's my
opinion, s'I, 'n' if any body k'n start a better one, s'I, let him _do_
it, s'I, that's all.  I says to Sister Dunlap, s'I--
Why, dog my cats, they must a ben a house-full o' niggers in there
every night for four weeks to a done all that work, Sister Phelps.  Look
at that shirt--every last inch of it kivered over with secret African
writ'n done with blood!  Must a ben a raft uv 'm at it right along, all
the time, amost.  Why, I'd give two dollars to have it read to me; 'n'
as for the niggers that wrote it, I 'low I'd take 'n' lash 'm t'll--
People to _help_ him, Brother Marples!  Well, I reckon you'd _think_
so if you'd a been in this house for a while back.  Why, they've stole
everything they could lay their hands on--and we a-watching all the time,
mind you. They stole that shirt right off o' the line! and as for that
sheet they made the rag ladder out of, ther' ain't no telling how
many times they _didn't_ steal that; and flour, and candles, and
candlesticks, and spoons, and the old warming-pan, and most a thousand
things that I disremember now, and my new calico dress; and me and
Silas and my Sid and Tom on the constant watch day _and_ night, as I was
a-telling you, and not a one of us could catch hide nor hair nor sight
nor sound of them; and here at the last minute, lo and behold you, they
slides right in under our noses and fools us, and not only fools _us_
but the Injun Territory robbers too, and actuly gets _away_ with that
nigger safe and sound, and that with sixteen men and twenty-two dogs
right on their very heels at that very time!  I tell you, it just bangs
anything I ever _heard_ of. Why, _sperits_ couldn't a done better and
been no smarter. And I reckon they must a _been_ sperits--because, _you_
know our dogs, and ther' ain't no better; well, them dogs never even got
on the _track_ of 'm once!  You explain _that_ to me if you can!--_any_
of you!
Well, it does beat--
Laws alive, I never--
So help me, I wouldn't a be--
_House_-thieves as well as--
Goodnessgracioussakes, I'd a ben afeard to live in sich a--
'Fraid to _live_!--why, I was that scared I dasn't hardly go to bed, or
get up, or lay down, or _set_ down, Sister Ridgeway.  Why, they'd steal
the very--why, goodness sakes, you can guess what kind of a fluster I was
in by the time midnight come last night.  I hope to gracious if I warn't
afraid they'd steal some o' the family!  I was just to that pass I
didn't have no reasoning faculties no more.  It looks foolish enough
_now_, in the daytime; but I says to myself, there's my two poor boys
asleep, 'way up stairs in that lonesome room, and I declare to goodness
I was that uneasy 't I crep' up there and locked 'em in!  I _did_.  And
anybody would. Because, you know, when you get scared that way, and it
keeps running on, and getting worse and worse all the time, and your
wits gets to addling, and you get to doing all sorts o' wild things,
and by and by you think to yourself, spos'n I was a boy, and was away up
there, and the door ain't locked, and you-- She stopped, looking kind
of wondering, and then she turned her head around slow, and when her eye
lit on me--I got up and took a walk.
Says I to myself, I can explain better how we come to not be in that
room this morning if I go out to one side and study over it a little.
So I done it.  But I dasn't go fur, or she'd a sent for me.  And when
it was late in the day the people all went, and then I come in and
told her the noise and shooting waked up me and Sid, and the door was
locked, and we wanted to see the fun, so we went down the lightning-rod,
and both of us got hurt a little, and we didn't never want to try _that_
no more.  And then I went on and told her all what I told Uncle Silas
before; and then she said she'd forgive us, and maybe it was all right
enough anyway, and about what a body might expect of boys, for all boys
was a pretty harum-scarum lot as fur as she could see; and so, as long
as no harm hadn't come of it, she judged she better put in her time
being grateful we was alive and well and she had us still, stead of
fretting over what was past and done.  So then she kissed me, and patted
me on the head, and dropped into a kind of a brown study; and pretty
soon jumps up, and says:
Why, lawsamercy, it's most night, and Sid not come yet!  What _has_
become of that boy?
I see my chance; so I skips up and says:
I'll run right up to town and get him, I says.
No you won't, she says.  You'll stay right wher' you are; _one's_
enough to be lost at a time.  If he ain't here to supper, your uncle 'll
go.
Well, he warn't there to supper; so right after supper uncle went.
He come back about ten a little bit uneasy; hadn't run across Tom's
track. Aunt Sally was a good _deal_ uneasy; but Uncle Silas he said
there warn't no occasion to be--boys will be boys, he said, and you'll
see this one turn up in the morning all sound and right.  So she had
to be satisfied.  But she said she'd set up for him a while anyway, and
keep a light burning so he could see it.
And then when I went up to bed she come up with me and fetched her
candle, and tucked me in, and mothered me so good I felt mean, and like
I couldn't look her in the face; and she set down on the bed and talked
with me a long time, and said what a splendid boy Sid was, and didn't
seem to want to ever stop talking about him; and kept asking me every
now and then if I reckoned he could a got lost, or hurt, or maybe
drownded, and might be laying at this minute somewheres suffering or
dead, and she not by him to help him, and so the tears would drip down
silent, and I would tell her that Sid was all right, and would be home
in the morning, sure; and she would squeeze my hand, or maybe kiss me,
and tell me to say it again, and keep on saying it, because it done her
good, and she was in so much trouble.  And when she was going away she
looked down in my eyes so steady and gentle, and says:
The door ain't going to be locked, Tom, and there's the window and
the rod; but you'll be good, _won't_ you?  And you won't go?  For _my_
sake.
Laws knows I _wanted_ to go bad enough to see about Tom, and was all
intending to go; but after that I wouldn't a went, not for kingdoms.
But she was on my mind and Tom was on my mind, so I slept very restless.
And twice I went down the rod away in the night, and slipped around
front, and see her setting there by her candle in the window with her
eyes towards the road and the tears in them; and I wished I could do
something for her, but I couldn't, only to swear that I wouldn't never
do nothing to grieve her any more.  And the third time I waked up at
dawn, and slid down, and she was there yet, and her candle was most out,
and her old gray head was resting on her hand, and she was asleep.
CHAPTER XLII.
THE old man was uptown again before breakfast, but couldn't get no
track of Tom; and both of them set at the table thinking, and not saying
nothing, and looking mournful, and their coffee getting cold, and not
eating anything. And by and by the old man says:
Did I give you the letter?
What letter?
The one I got yesterday out of the post-office.
No, you didn't give me no letter.
Well, I must a forgot it.
So he rummaged his pockets, and then went off somewheres where he had
laid it down, and fetched it, and give it to her.  She says:
Why, it's from St. Petersburg--it's from Sis.
I allowed another walk would do me good; but I couldn't stir.  But
before she could break it open she dropped it and run--for she see
something. And so did I. It was Tom Sawyer on a mattress; and that old
doctor; and Jim, in _her_ calico dress, with his hands tied behind him;
and a lot of people.  I hid the letter behind the first thing that come
handy, and rushed.  She flung herself at Tom, crying, and says:
Oh, he's dead, he's dead, I know he's dead!
And Tom he turned his head a little, and muttered something or other,
which showed he warn't in his right mind; then she flung up her hands,
and says:
He's alive, thank God!  And that's enough! and she snatched a kiss of
him, and flew for the house to get the bed ready, and scattering orders
right and left at the niggers and everybody else, as fast as her tongue
could go, every jump of the way.
I followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim; and the
old doctor and Uncle Silas followed after Tom into the house.  The men
was very huffy, and some of them wanted to hang Jim for an example to
all the other niggers around there, so they wouldn't be trying to run
away like Jim done, and making such a raft of trouble, and keeping a
whole family scared most to death for days and nights.  But the others
said, don't do it, it wouldn't answer at all; he ain't our nigger, and
his owner would turn up and make us pay for him, sure.  So that cooled
them down a little, because the people that's always the most anxious
for to hang a nigger that hain't done just right is always the very
ones that ain't the most anxious to pay for him when they've got their
satisfaction out of him.
They cussed Jim considerble, though, and give him a cuff or two side the
head once in a while, but Jim never said nothing, and he never let on to
know me, and they took him to the same cabin, and put his own clothes
on him, and chained him again, and not to no bed-leg this time, but to
a big staple drove into the bottom log, and chained his hands, too, and
both legs, and said he warn't to have nothing but bread and water to
eat after this till his owner come, or he was sold at auction because
he didn't come in a certain length of time, and filled up our hole, and
said a couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about the
cabin every night, and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime; and
about this time they was through with the job and was tapering off with
a kind of generl good-bye cussing, and then the old doctor comes and
takes a look, and says:
Don't be no rougher on him than you're obleeged to, because he ain't
a bad nigger.  When I got to where I found the boy I see I couldn't cut
the bullet out without some help, and he warn't in no condition for
me to leave to go and get help; and he got a little worse and a little
worse, and after a long time he went out of his head, and wouldn't let
me come a-nigh him any more, and said if I chalked his raft he'd kill
me, and no end of wild foolishness like that, and I see I couldn't do
anything at all with him; so I says, I got to have _help_ somehow; and
the minute I says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says
he'll help, and he done it, too, and done it very well.  Of course I
judged he must be a runaway nigger, and there I _was_! and there I had
to stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night.  It
was a fix, I tell you! I had a couple of patients with the chills, and
of course I'd of liked to run up to town and see them, but I dasn't,
because the nigger might get away, and then I'd be to blame; and yet
never a skiff come close enough for me to hail.  So there I had to stick
plumb until daylight this morning; and I never see a nigger that was a
better nuss or faithfuller, and yet he was risking his freedom to do it,
and was all tired out, too, and I see plain enough he'd been worked
main hard lately.  I liked the nigger for that; I tell you, gentlemen, a
nigger like that is worth a thousand dollars--and kind treatment, too.  I
had everything I needed, and the boy was doing as well there as he
would a done at home--better, maybe, because it was so quiet; but there I
_was_, with both of 'm on my hands, and there I had to stick till about
dawn this morning; then some men in a skiff come by, and as good luck
would have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped
on his knees sound asleep; so I motioned them in quiet, and they slipped
up on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was
about, and we never had no trouble. And the boy being in a kind of a
flighty sleep, too, we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on, and
towed her over very nice and quiet, and the nigger never made the least
row nor said a word from the start.  He ain't no bad nigger, gentlemen;
that's what I think about him.
Somebody says:
Well, it sounds very good, doctor, I'm obleeged to say.
Then the others softened up a little, too, and I was mighty thankful
to that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn; and I was glad it was
according to my judgment of him, too; because I thought he had a good
heart in him and was a good man the first time I see him.  Then they
all agreed that Jim had acted very well, and was deserving to have some
notice took of it, and reward.  So every one of them promised, right out
and hearty, that they wouldn't cuss him no more.
Then they come out and locked him up.  I hoped they was going to say he
could have one or two of the chains took off, because they was rotten
heavy, or could have meat and greens with his bread and water; but they
didn't think of it, and I reckoned it warn't best for me to mix in, but
I judged I'd get the doctor's yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other as
soon as I'd got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of
me--explanations, I mean, of how I forgot to mention about Sid being shot
when I was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddling
around hunting the runaway nigger.
But I had plenty time.  Aunt Sally she stuck to the sick-room all day
and all night, and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning around I dodged
him.
Next morning I heard Tom was a good deal better, and they said Aunt
Sally was gone to get a nap.  So I slips to the sick-room, and if I
found him awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that
would wash. But he was sleeping, and sleeping very peaceful, too; and
pale, not fire-faced the way he was when he come.  So I set down and
laid for him to wake.  In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding
in, and there I was, up a stump again!  She motioned me to be still, and
set down by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be joyful
now, because all the symptoms was first-rate, and he'd been sleeping
like that for ever so long, and looking better and peacefuller all the
time, and ten to one he'd wake up in his right mind.
So we set there watching, and by and by he stirs a bit, and opened his
eyes very natural, and takes a look, and says:
Hello!--why, I'm at _home_!  How's that?  Where's the raft?
It's all right, I says.
And _Jim_?
The same, I says, but couldn't say it pretty brash.  But he never
noticed, but says:
Good!  Splendid!  _Now_ we're all right and safe! Did you tell Aunty?
I was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says:  About what, Sid?
Why, about the way the whole thing was done.
What whole thing?
Why, _the_ whole thing.  There ain't but one; how we set the runaway
nigger free--me and Tom.
Good land!  Set the run--What _is_ the child talking about!  Dear, dear,
out of his head again!
_No_, I ain't out of my _head_; I know all what I'm talking about.  We
_did_ set him free--me and Tom.  We laid out to do it, and we _done_ it.
And we done it elegant, too.  He'd got a start, and she never checked
him up, just set and stared and stared, and let him clip along, and
I see it warn't no use for _me_ to put in.  Why, Aunty, it cost us a
power of work--weeks of it--hours and hours, every night, whilst you was
all asleep. And we had to steal candles, and the sheet, and the shirt,
and your dress, and spoons, and tin plates, and case-knives, and the
warming-pan, and the grindstone, and flour, and just no end of things,
and you can't think what work it was to make the saws, and pens, and
inscriptions, and one thing or another, and you can't think _half_ the
fun it was.  And we had to make up the pictures of coffins and things,
and nonnamous letters from the robbers, and get up and down the
lightning-rod, and dig the hole into the cabin, and made the rope ladder
and send it in cooked up in a pie, and send in spoons and things to work
with in your apron pocket--
Mercy sakes!
--and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on, for company for
Jim; and then you kept Tom here so long with the butter in his hat that
you come near spiling the whole business, because the men come before
we was out of the cabin, and we had to rush, and they heard us and let
drive at us, and I got my share, and we dodged out of the path and let
them go by, and when the dogs come they warn't interested in us, but
went for the most noise, and we got our canoe, and made for the
raft, and was all safe, and Jim was a free man, and we done it all by
ourselves, and _wasn't_ it bully, Aunty!
Well, I never heard the likes of it in all my born days!  So it was
_you_, you little rapscallions, that's been making all this trouble,
and turned everybody's wits clean inside out and scared us all most to
death.  I've as good a notion as ever I had in my life to take it out
o' you this very minute.  To think, here I've been, night after night,
a--_you_ just get well once, you young scamp, and I lay I'll tan the Old
Harry out o' both o' ye!
But Tom, he _was_ so proud and joyful, he just _couldn't_ hold in,
and his tongue just _went_ it--she a-chipping in, and spitting fire all
along, and both of them going it at once, like a cat convention; and she
says:
_Well_, you get all the enjoyment you can out of it _now_, for mind I
tell you if I catch you meddling with him again--
Meddling with _who_?  Tom says, dropping his smile and looking
surprised.
With _who_?  Why, the runaway nigger, of course.  Who'd you reckon?
Tom looks at me very grave, and says:
Tom, didn't you just tell me he was all right?  Hasn't he got away?
_Him_? says Aunt Sally; the runaway nigger?  'Deed he hasn't.
They've got him back, safe and sound, and he's in that cabin again,
on bread and water, and loaded down with chains, till he's claimed or
sold!
Tom rose square up in bed, with his eye hot, and his nostrils opening
and shutting like gills, and sings out to me:
They hain't no _right_ to shut him up!  SHOVE!--and don't you lose a
minute.  Turn him loose! he ain't no slave; he's as free as any cretur
that walks this earth!
What _does_ the child mean?
I mean every word I _say_, Aunt Sally, and if somebody don't go, _I'll_
go. I've knowed him all his life, and so has Tom, there.  Old Miss
Watson died two months ago, and she was ashamed she ever was going to
sell him down the river, and _said_ so; and she set him free in her
will.
Then what on earth did _you_ want to set him free for, seeing he was
already free?
Well, that _is_ a question, I must say; and just like women!  Why,
I wanted the _adventure_ of it; and I'd a waded neck-deep in blood
to--goodness alive, _Aunt Polly!_
If she warn't standing right there, just inside the door, looking as
sweet and contented as an angel half full of pie, I wish I may never!
Aunt Sally jumped for her, and most hugged the head off of her, and
cried over her, and I found a good enough place for me under the bed,
for it was getting pretty sultry for us, seemed to me.  And I peeped
out, and in a little while Tom's Aunt Polly shook herself loose and
stood there looking across at Tom over her spectacles--kind of grinding
him into the earth, you know.  And then she says:
Yes, you _better_ turn y'r head away--I would if I was you, Tom.
Oh, deary me! says Aunt Sally; _Is_ he changed so?  Why, that ain't
_Tom_, it's Sid; Tom's--Tom's--why, where is Tom?  He was here a minute
ago.
You mean where's Huck _Finn_--that's what you mean!  I reckon I hain't
raised such a scamp as my Tom all these years not to know him when I
_see_ him.  That _would_ be a pretty howdy-do. Come out from under that
bed, Huck Finn.
So I done it.  But not feeling brash.
Aunt Sally she was one of the mixed-upest-looking persons I ever
see--except one, and that was Uncle Silas, when he come in and they told
it all to him.  It kind of made him drunk, as you may say, and he didn't
know nothing at all the rest of the day, and preached a prayer-meeting
sermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation, because the
oldest man in the world couldn't a understood it.  So Tom's Aunt Polly,
she told all about who I was, and what; and I had to up and tell how
I was in such a tight place that when Mrs. Phelps took me for Tom
Sawyer--she chipped in and says, Oh, go on and call me Aunt Sally, I'm
used to it now, and 'tain't no need to change--that when Aunt Sally took
me for Tom Sawyer I had to stand it--there warn't no other way, and
I knowed he wouldn't mind, because it would be nuts for him, being
a mystery, and he'd make an adventure out of it, and be perfectly
satisfied.  And so it turned out, and he let on to be Sid, and made
things as soft as he could for me.
And his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson setting
Jim free in her will; and so, sure enough, Tom Sawyer had gone and took
all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free! and I couldn't
ever understand before, until that minute and that talk, how he _could_
help a body set a nigger free with his bringing-up.
Well, Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that Tom and
_Sid_ had come all right and safe, she says to herself:
Look at that, now!  I might have expected it, letting him go off that
way without anybody to watch him.  So now I got to go and trapse all
the way down the river, eleven hundred mile, and find out what that
creetur's up to _this_ time, as long as I couldn't seem to get any
answer out of you about it.
Why, I never heard nothing from you, says Aunt Sally.
Well, I wonder!  Why, I wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean
by Sid being here.
Well, I never got 'em, Sis.
Aunt Polly she turns around slow and severe, and says:
You, Tom!
Well--_what_? he says, kind of pettish.
Don't you what _me_, you impudent thing--hand out them letters.
What letters?
_Them_ letters.  I be bound, if I have to take a-holt of you I'll--
They're in the trunk.  There, now.  And they're just the same as they
was when I got them out of the office.  I hain't looked into them, I
hain't touched them.  But I knowed they'd make trouble, and I thought if
you warn't in no hurry, I'd--
Well, you _do_ need skinning, there ain't no mistake about it.  And I
wrote another one to tell you I was coming; and I s'pose he--
No, it come yesterday; I hain't read it yet, but _it's_ all right, I've
got that one.
I wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadn't, but I reckoned maybe it
was just as safe to not to.  So I never said nothing.
CHAPTER THE LAST
THE first time I catched Tom private I asked him what was his idea, time
of the evasion?--what it was he'd planned to do if the evasion worked all
right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before?
And he said, what he had planned in his head from the start, if we got
Jim out all safe, was for us to run him down the river on the raft, and
have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river, and then tell him about
his being free, and take him back up home on a steamboat, in style,
and pay him for his lost time, and write word ahead and get out all
the niggers around, and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight
procession and a brass-band, and then he would be a hero, and so would
we.  But I reckoned it was about as well the way it was.
We had Jim out of the chains in no time, and when Aunt Polly and Uncle
Silas and Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse Tom,
they made a heap of fuss over him, and fixed him up prime, and give him
all he wanted to eat, and a good time, and nothing to do.  And we had
him up to the sick-room, and had a high talk; and Tom give Jim forty
dollars for being prisoner for us so patient, and doing it up so good,
and Jim was pleased most to death, and busted out, and says:
Dah, now, Huck, what I tell you?--what I tell you up dah on Jackson
islan'?  I _tole_ you I got a hairy breas', en what's de sign un it; en
I _tole_ you I ben rich wunst, en gwineter to be rich _agin_; en it's
come true; en heah she is!  _dah_, now! doan' talk to _me_--signs is
_signs_, mine I tell you; en I knowed jis' 's well 'at I 'uz gwineter be
rich agin as I's a-stannin' heah dis minute!
And then Tom he talked along and talked along, and says, le's all three
slide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit, and go for
howling adventures amongst the Injuns, over in the Territory, for a
couple of weeks or two; and I says, all right, that suits me, but I
ain't got no money for to buy the outfit, and I reckon I couldn't get
none from home, because it's likely pap's been back before now, and got
it all away from Judge Thatcher and drunk it up.
No, he hain't, Tom says; it's all there yet--six thousand dollars
and more; and your pap hain't ever been back since.  Hadn't when I come
away, anyhow.
Jim says, kind of solemn:
He ain't a-comin' back no mo', Huck.
I says:
Why, Jim?
Nemmine why, Huck--but he ain't comin' back no mo.
But I kept at him; so at last he says:
Doan' you 'member de house dat was float'n down de river, en dey wuz a
man in dah, kivered up, en I went in en unkivered him and didn' let you
come in?  Well, den, you kin git yo' money when you wants it, kase dat
wuz him.
Tom's most well now, and got his bullet around his neck on a watch-guard
for a watch, and is always seeing what time it is, and so there ain't
nothing more to write about, and I am rotten glad of it, because if I'd
a knowed what a trouble it was to make a book I wouldn't a tackled it,
and ain't a-going to no more.  But I reckon I got to light out for the
Territory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally she's going to adopt me
and sivilize me, and I can't stand it.  I been there before.
THE END. YOURS TRULY, _HUCK FINN_.
CHAPTER I
TOM!
No answer.
TOM!
No answer.
What's gone with that boy,  I wonder? You TOM!
No answer.
The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the
room; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or
never looked _through_ them for so small a thing as a boy; they were
her state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for style, not
service--she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well.
She looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but
still loud enough for the furniture to hear:
Well, I lay if I get hold of you I'll--
She did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching
under the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the
punches with. She resurrected nothing but the cat.
I never did see the beat of that boy!
She went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the
tomato vines and jimpson weeds that constituted the garden. No Tom. So
she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted:
Y-o-u-u TOM!
There was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize
a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.
There! I might 'a' thought of that closet. What you been doing in
there?
Nothing.
Nothing! Look at your hands. And look at your mouth. What _is_ that
truck?
I don't know, aunt.
Well, I know. It's jam--that's what it is. Forty times I've said if you
didn't let that jam alone I'd skin you. Hand me that switch.
The switch hovered in the air--the peril was desperate--
My! Look behind you, aunt!
The old lady whirled round, and snatched her skirts out of danger.
The lad fled on the instant, scrambled up the high board-fence, and
disappeared over it.
His aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a gentle
laugh.
Hang the boy, can't I never learn anything? Ain't he played me tricks
enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time? But old
fools is the biggest fools there is. Can't learn an old dog new tricks,
as the saying is. But my goodness, he never plays them alike, two days,
and how is a body to know what's coming? He 'pears to know just how long
he can torment me before I get my dander up, and he knows if he can make
out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh, it's all down again and
I can't hit him a lick. I ain't doing my duty by that boy, and that's
the Lord's truth, goodness knows. Spare the rod and spile the child,
as the Good Book says. I'm a laying up sin and suffering for us both,
I know. He's full of the Old Scratch, but laws-a-me! he's my own
dead sister's boy, poor thing, and I ain't got the heart to lash him,
somehow. Every time I let him off, my conscience does hurt me so, and
every time I hit him my old heart most breaks. Well-a-well, man that is
born of woman is of few days and full of trouble, as the Scripture
says, and I reckon it's so. He'll play hookey this evening, * and [*
Southwestern for afternoon] I'll just be obleeged to make him work,
tomorrow, to punish him. It's mighty hard to make him work Saturdays,
when all the boys is having holiday, but he hates work more than he
hates anything else, and I've _got_ to do some of my duty by him, or
I'll be the ruination of the child.
Tom did play hookey, and he had a very good time. He got back home
barely in season to help Jim, the small colored boy, saw next-day's wood
and split the kindlings before supper--at least he was there in time
to tell his adventures to Jim while Jim did three-fourths of the work.
Tom's younger brother (or rather half-brother) Sid was already through
with his part of the work (picking up chips), for he was a quiet boy,
and had no adventurous, trouble-some ways.
While Tom was eating his supper, and stealing sugar as opportunity
offered, Aunt Polly asked him questions that were full of guile, and
very deep--for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments. Like
many other simple-hearted souls, it was her pet vanity to believe she
was endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she
loved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low
cunning. Said she:
Tom, it was middling warm in school, warn't it?
Yes'm.
Powerful warm, warn't it?
Yes'm.
Didn't you want to go in a-swimming, Tom?
A bit of a scare shot through Tom--a touch of uncomfortable suspicion. He
searched Aunt Polly's face, but it told him nothing. So he said:
No'm--well, not very much.
The old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom's shirt, and said:
But you ain't too warm now, though. And it flattered her to reflect
that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing
that that was what she had in her mind. But in spite of her, Tom knew
where the wind lay, now. So he forestalled what might be the next move:
Some of us pumped on our heads--mine's damp yet. See?
Aunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of
circumstantial evidence, and missed a trick. Then she had a new
inspiration:
Tom, you didn't have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, to
pump on your head, did you? Unbutton your jacket!
The trouble vanished out of Tom's face. He opened his jacket. His shirt
collar was securely sewed.
Bother! Well, go 'long with you. I'd made sure you'd played hookey
and been a-swimming. But I forgive ye, Tom. I reckon you're a kind of a
singed cat, as the saying is--better'n you look. _This_ time.
She was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried, and half glad that Tom
had stumbled into obedient conduct for once.
But Sidney said:
Well, now, if I didn't think you sewed his collar with white thread,
but it's black.
Why, I did sew it with white! Tom!
But Tom did not wait for the rest. As he went out at the door he said:
Siddy, I'll lick you for that.
In a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust into
the lapels of his jacket, and had thread bound about them--one needle
carried white thread and the other black. He said:
She'd never noticed if it hadn't been for Sid. Confound it! sometimes
she sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with black. I wish to
gee-miny she'd stick to one or t'other--I can't keep the run of 'em. But
I bet you I'll lam Sid for that. I'll learn him!
He was not the Model Boy of the village. He knew the model boy very well
though--and loathed him.
Within two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his troubles. Not
because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a
man's are to a man, but because a new and powerful interest bore
them down and drove them out of his mind for the time--just as men's
misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises. This new
interest was a valued novelty in whistling, which he had just acquired
from a negro, and he was suffering to practise it un-disturbed. It
consisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of liquid warble,
produced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short
intervals in the midst of the music--the reader probably remembers how to
do it, if he has ever been a boy. Diligence and attention soon gave him
the knack of it, and he strode down the street with his mouth full of
harmony and his soul full of gratitude. He felt much as an astronomer
feels who has discovered a new planet--no doubt, as far as strong, deep,
unalloyed pleasure is concerned, the advantage was with the boy, not the
astronomer.
The summer evenings were long. It was not dark, yet. Presently Tom
checked his whistle. A stranger was before him--a boy a shade larger
than himself. A new-comer of any age or either sex was an im-pressive
curiosity in the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg. This boy
was well dressed, too--well dressed on a week-day. This was simply as
astounding. His cap was a dainty thing, his close-buttoned blue cloth
roundabout was new and natty, and so were his pantaloons. He had shoes
on--and it was only Friday. He even wore a necktie, a bright bit of
ribbon. He had a citified air about him that ate into Tom's vitals. The
more Tom stared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned up his nose
at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to
him to grow. Neither boy spoke. If one moved, the other moved--but only
sidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face and eye to eye all the
time. Finally Tom said:
I can lick you!
I'd like to see you try it.
Well, I can do it.
No you can't, either.
Yes I can.
No you can't.
I can.
You can't.
Can!
Can't!
An uncomfortable pause. Then Tom said:
What's your name?
'Tisn't any of your business, maybe.
Well I 'low I'll _make_ it my business.
Well why don't you?
If you say much, I will.
Much--much--_much_. There now.
Oh, you think you're mighty smart, _don't_ you? I could lick you with
one hand tied behind me, if I wanted to.
Well why don't you _do_ it? You _say_ you can do it.
Well I _will_, if you fool with me.
Oh yes--I've seen whole families in the same fix.
Smarty! You think you're _some_, now, _don't_ you? Oh, what a hat!
You can lump that hat if you don't like it. I dare you to knock it
off--and anybody that'll take a dare will suck eggs.
You're a liar!
You're another.
You're a fighting liar and dasn't take it up.
Aw--take a walk!
Say--if you give me much more of your sass I'll take and bounce a rock
off'n your head.
Oh, of _course_ you will.
Well I _will_.
Well why don't you _do_ it then? What do you keep _saying_ you will
for? Why don't you _do_ it? It's because you're afraid.
I _ain't_ afraid.
You are.
I ain't.
You are.
Another pause, and more eying and sidling around each other. Presently
they were shoulder to shoulder. Tom said:
Get away from here!
Go away yourself!
I won't.
I won't either.
So they stood, each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace, and both
shoving with might and main, and glowering at each other with hate. But
neither could get an advantage. After struggling till both were hot and
flushed, each relaxed his strain with watchful caution, and Tom said:
You're a coward and a pup. I'll tell my big brother on you, and he can
thrash you with his little finger, and I'll make him do it, too.
What do I care for your big brother? I've got a brother that's bigger
than he is--and what's more, he can throw him over that fence, too.
[Both brothers were imaginary.]
That's a lie.
_Your_ saying so don't make it so.
Tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and said:
I dare you to step over that, and I'll lick you till you can't stand
up. Anybody that'll take a dare will steal sheep.
The new boy stepped over promptly, and said:
Now you said you'd do it, now let's see you do it.
Don't you crowd me now; you better look out.
Well, you _said_ you'd do it--why don't you do it?
By jingo! for two cents I _will_ do it.
The new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out
with derision. Tom struck them to the ground. In an instant both boys
were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped together like cats; and
for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other's hair and
clothes, punched and scratched each other's nose, and covered themselves
with dust and glory. Presently the confusion took form, and through the
fog of battle Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding him
with his fists. Holler 'nuff! said he.
The boy only struggled to free himself. He was crying--mainly from rage.
Holler 'nuff!--and the pounding went on.
At last the stranger got out a smothered 'Nuff! and Tom let him up and
said:
Now that'll learn you. Better look out who you're fooling with next
time.
The new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes, sobbing,
snuffling, and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and
threatening what he would do to Tom the next time he caught him out.
To which Tom responded with jeers, and started off in high feather, and
as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw it
and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like
an antelope. Tom chased the traitor home, and thus found out where he
lived. He then held a position at the gate for some time, daring the
enemy to come outside, but the enemy only made faces at him through the
window and declined. At last the enemy's mother appeared, and called Tom
a bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away. So he went away; but
he said he 'lowed to lay for that boy.
He got home pretty late that night, and when he climbed cautiously in
at the window, he uncovered an ambuscade, in the person of his aunt; and
when she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn his
Saturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in its
firmness.
CHAPTER II
SATURDAY morning was come, and all the summer world was bright and
fresh, and brimming with life. There was a song in every heart; and if
the heart was young the music issued at the lips. There was cheer in
every face and a spring in every step. The locust-trees were in bloom
and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air. Cardiff Hill, beyond
the village and above it, was green with vegetation and it lay just far
enough away to seem a Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting.
Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a
long-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and
a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board
fence nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a
burden. Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost
plank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant
whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed
fence, and sat down on a tree-box discouraged. Jim came skipping out at
the gate with a tin pail, and singing Buffalo Gals. Bringing water from
the town pump had always been hateful work in Tom's eyes, before, but
now it did not strike him so. He remembered that there was company at
the pump. White, mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there
waiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling, fighting,
skylarking. And he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred
and fifty yards off, Jim never got back with a bucket of water under an
hour--and even then somebody generally had to go after him. Tom said:
Say, Jim, I'll fetch the water if you'll whitewash some.
Jim shook his head and said:
Can't, Mars Tom. Ole missis, she tole me I got to go an' git dis water
an' not stop foolin' roun' wid anybody. She say she spec' Mars Tom gwine
to ax me to whitewash, an' so she tole me go 'long an' 'tend to my own
business--she 'lowed _she'd_ 'tend to de whitewashin'.
Oh, never you mind what she said, Jim. That's the way she always talks.
Gimme the bucket--I won't be gone only a a minute. _She_ won't ever
know.
Oh, I dasn't, Mars Tom. Ole missis she'd take an' tar de head off'n me.
'Deed she would.
_She_! She never licks anybody--whacks 'em over the head with her
thimble--and who cares for that, I'd like to know. She talks awful, but
talk don't hurt--anyways it don't if she don't cry. Jim, I'll give you a
marvel. I'll give you a white alley!
Jim began to waver.
White alley, Jim! And it's a bully taw.
My! Dat's a mighty gay marvel, I tell you! But Mars Tom I's powerful
'fraid ole missis--
And besides, if you will I'll show you my sore toe.
Jim was only human--this attraction was too much for him. He put down
his pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with absorbing
interest while the bandage was being unwound. In another moment he
was flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear, Tom was
whitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly was retiring from the field with
a slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye.
But Tom's energy did not last. He began to think of the fun he had
planned for this day, and his sorrows multiplied. Soon the free boys
would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions, and
they would make a world of fun of him for having to work--the very
thought of it burnt him like fire. He got out his worldly wealth and
examined it--bits of toys, marbles, and trash; enough to buy an exchange
of _work_, maybe, but not half enough to buy so much as half an hour
of pure freedom. So he returned his straitened means to his pocket, and
gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys. At this dark and hopeless
moment an inspiration burst upon him! Nothing less than a great,
magnificent inspiration.
He took up his brush and went tranquilly to work. Ben Rogers hove in
sight presently--the very boy, of all boys, whose ridicule he had been
dreading. Ben's gait was the hop-skip-and-jump--proof enough that his
heart was light and his anticipations high. He was eating an apple, and
giving a long, melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-toned
ding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was personating a steamboat. As
he drew near, he slackened speed, took the middle of the street, leaned
far over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious pomp
and circumstance--for he was personating the Big Missouri, and considered
himself to be drawing nine feet of water. He was boat and captain and
engine-bells combined, so he had to imagine himself standing on his own
hurricane-deck giving the orders and executing them:
Stop her, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling! The headway ran almost out, and he
drew up slowly toward the sidewalk.
Ship up to back! Ting-a-ling-ling! His arms straightened and stiffened
down his sides.
Set her back on the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow! ch-chow-wow!
Chow! His right hand, mean-time, describing stately circles--for it was
representing a forty-foot wheel.
Let her go back on the labboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ch-chow-chow!
The left hand began to describe circles.
Stop the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Stop the labboard! Come ahead on
the stabboard! Stop her! Let your outside turn over slow! Ting-a-ling-ling!
Chow-ow-ow! Get out that head-line! _lively_ now! Come--out with
your spring-line--what're you about there! Take a turn round that stump
with the bight of it! Stand by that stage, now--let her go! Done with
the engines, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling! SH'T! S'H'T! SH'T! (trying the
gauge-cocks).
Tom went on whitewashing--paid no attention to the steamboat. Ben stared
a moment and then said: _Hi-Yi! You're_ up a stump, ain't you!
No answer. Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist, then
he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result, as
before. Ben ranged up alongside of him. Tom's mouth watered for the
apple, but he stuck to his work. Ben said:
Hello, old chap, you got to work, hey?
Tom wheeled suddenly and said:
Why, it's you, Ben! I warn't noticing.
Say--I'm going in a-swimming, I am. Don't you wish you could? But of
course you'd druther _work_--wouldn't you? Course you would!
Tom contemplated the boy a bit, and said:
What do you call work?
Why, ain't _that_ work?
Tom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly:
Well, maybe it is, and maybe it ain't. All I know, is, it suits Tom
Sawyer.
Oh come, now, you don't mean to let on that you _like_ it?
The brush continued to move.
Like it? Well, I don't see why I oughtn't to like it. Does a boy get a
chance to whitewash a fence every day?
That put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his apple.
Tom swept his brush daintily back and forth--stepped back to note the
effect--added a touch here and there--criticised the effect again--Ben
watching every move and getting more and more interested, more and more
absorbed. Presently he said:
Say, Tom, let _me_ whitewash a little.
Tom considered, was about to consent; but he altered his mind:
No--no--I reckon it wouldn't hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly's awful
particular about this fence--right here on the street, you know--but if it
was the back fence I wouldn't mind and _she_ wouldn't. Yes, she's awful
particular about this fence; it's got to be done very careful; I reckon
there ain't one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it
the way it's got to be done.
No--is that so? Oh come, now--lemme just try. Only just a little--I'd let
_you_, if you was me, Tom.
Ben, I'd like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly--well, Jim wanted to do
it, but she wouldn't let him; Sid wanted to do it, and she wouldn't let
Sid. Now don't you see how I'm fixed? If you was to tackle this fence
and anything was to happen to it--
Oh, shucks, I'll be just as careful. Now lemme try. Say--I'll give you
the core of my apple.
Well, here--No, Ben, now don't. I'm afeard--
I'll give you _all_ of it!
Tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face, but alacrity in his
heart. And while the late steamer Big Missouri worked and sweated in the
sun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by,
dangled his legs, munched his apple, and planned the slaughter of more
innocents. There was no lack of material; boys happened along every
little while; they came to jeer, but remained to whitewash. By the time
Ben was fagged out, Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for
a kite, in good repair; and when he played out, Johnny Miller bought in
for a dead rat and a string to swing it with--and so on, and so on, hour
after hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came, from being a
poor poverty-stricken boy in the morning, Tom was literally rolling in
wealth. He had besides the things before mentioned, twelve marbles, part
of a jews-harp, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look through, a spool
cannon, a key that wouldn't unlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a
glass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles,
six fire-crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass door-knob, a
dog-collar--but no dog--the handle of a knife, four pieces of orange-peel,
and a dilapidated old window sash.
He had had a nice, good, idle time all the while--plenty of company--and
the fence had three coats of whitewash on it! If he hadn't run out of
whitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in the village.
Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after all. He
had discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it--namely,
that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary
to make the thing difficult to attain. If he had been a great and
wise philosopher, like the writer of this book, he would now have
comprehended that Work consists of whatever a body is _obliged_ to do,
and that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do. And
this would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or
performing on a tread-mill is work, while rolling ten-pins or climbing
Mont Blanc is only amusement. There are wealthy gentlemen in England
who drive four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a
daily line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them considerable
money; but if they were offered wages for the service, that would turn
it into work and then they would resign.
The boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken place
in his worldly circumstances, and then wended toward headquarters to
report.
CHAPTER III
TOM presented himself before Aunt Polly, who was sitting by an
open window in a pleasant rearward apartment, which was bedroom,
breakfast-room, dining-room, and library, combined. The balmy summer
air, the restful quiet, the odor of the flowers, and the drowsing
murmur of the bees had had their effect, and she was nodding over her
knitting--for she had no company but the cat, and it was asleep in her
lap. Her spectacles were propped up on her gray head for safety. She had
thought that of course Tom had deserted long ago, and she wondered at
seeing him place himself in her power again in this intrepid way. He
said: Mayn't I go and play now, aunt?
What, a'ready? How much have you done?
It's all done, aunt.
Tom, don't lie to me--I can't bear it.
I ain't, aunt; it _is_ all done.
Aunt Polly placed small trust in such evidence. She went out to see for
herself; and she would have been content to find twenty per cent. of
Tom's statement true. When she found the entire fence white-washed, and
not only whitewashed but elaborately coated and recoated, and even a
streak added to the ground, her astonishment was almost unspeakable. She
said:
Well, I never! There's no getting round it, you can work when you're a
mind to, Tom. And then she diluted the compliment by adding, But it's
powerful seldom you're a mind to, I'm bound to say. Well, go 'long and
play; but mind you get back some time in a week, or I'll tan you.
She was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took
him into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to him,
along with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a treat
took to itself when it came without sin through virtuous effort.
And while she closed with a happy Scriptural flourish, he hooked a
doughnut.
Then he skipped out, and saw Sid just starting up the outside stairway
that led to the back rooms on the second floor. Clods were handy and
the air was full of them in a twinkling. They raged around Sid like a
hail-storm; and before Aunt Polly could collect her surprised faculties
and sally to the rescue, six or seven clods had taken personal effect,
and Tom was over the fence and gone. There was a gate, but as a general
thing he was too crowded for time to make use of it. His soul was at
peace, now that he had settled with Sid for calling attention to his
black thread and getting him into trouble.
Tom skirted the block, and came round into a muddy alley that led by the
back of his aunt's cow-stable. He presently got safely beyond the reach
of capture and punishment, and hastened toward the public square of the
village, where two military companies of boys had met for conflict,
according to previous appointment. Tom was General of one of these
armies, Joe Harper (a bosom friend) General of the other. These two
great commanders did not condescend to fight in person--that being better
suited to the still smaller fry--but sat together on an eminence
and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through
aides-de-camp. Tom's army won a great victory, after a long and
hard-fought battle. Then the dead were counted, prisoners exchanged,
the terms of the next disagreement agreed upon, and the day for the
necessary battle appointed; after which the armies fell into line and
marched away, and Tom turned homeward alone.
As he was passing by the house where Jeff Thatcher lived, he saw a new
girl in the garden--a lovely little blue-eyed creature with yellow
hair plaited into two long-tails, white summer frock and embroidered
pan-talettes. The fresh-crowned hero fell without firing a shot. A
certain Amy Lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a
memory of herself behind. He had thought he loved her to distraction;
he had regarded his passion as adoration; and behold it was only a poor
little evanescent partiality. He had been months winning her; she had
confessed hardly a week ago; he had been the happiest and the proudest
boy in the world only seven short days, and here in one instant of time
she had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is
done.
He worshipped this new angel with furtive eye, till he saw that she had
discovered him; then he pretended he did not know she was present, and
began to show off in all sorts of absurd boyish ways, in order to win
her admiration. He kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time;
but by-and-by, while he was in the midst of some dangerous gymnastic
performances, he glanced aside and saw that the little girl was wending
her way toward the house. Tom came up to the fence and leaned on it,
grieving, and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer. She halted a
moment on the steps and then moved toward the door. Tom heaved a great
sigh as she put her foot on the threshold. But his face lit up,
right away, for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she
disappeared.
The boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower, and
then shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as
if he had discovered something of interest going on in that direction.
Presently he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on his
nose, with his head tilted far back; and as he moved from side to side,
in his efforts, he edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy; finally his
bare foot rested upon it, his pliant toes closed upon it, and he hopped
away with the treasure and disappeared round the corner. But only for a
minute--only while he could button the flower inside his jacket, next
his heart--or next his stomach, possibly, for he was not much posted in
anatomy, and not hypercritical, anyway.
He returned, now, and hung about the fence till nightfall, showing
off, as before; but the girl never exhibited herself again, though Tom
comforted himself a little with the hope that she had been near some
window, meantime, and been aware of his attentions. Finally he strode
home reluctantly, with his poor head full of visions.
All through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wondered what
had got into the child. He took a good scolding about clodding Sid, and
did not seem to mind it in the least. He tried to steal sugar under his
aunt's very nose, and got his knuckles rapped for it. He said:
Aunt, you don't whack Sid when he takes it.
Well, Sid don't torment a body the way you do. You'd be always into
that sugar if I warn't watching you.
Presently she stepped into the kitchen, and Sid, happy in his immunity,
reached for the sugar-bowl--a sort of glorying over Tom which was
wellnigh unbearable. But Sid's fingers slipped and the bowl dropped and
broke. Tom was in ecstasies. In such ecstasies that he even controlled
his tongue and was silent. He said to himself that he would not speak a
word, even when his aunt came in, but would sit perfectly still till she
asked who did the mischief; and then he would tell, and there would be
nothing so good in the world as to see that pet model catch it. He was
so brimful of exultation that he could hardly hold himself when the old
lady came back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings of wrath
from over her spectacles. He said to himself, Now it's coming! And the
next instant he was sprawling on the floor! The potent palm was uplifted
to strike again when Tom cried out:
Hold on, now, what 'er you belting _me_ for?--Sid broke it!
Aunt Polly paused, perplexed, and Tom looked for healing pity. But when
she got her tongue again, she only said:
Umf! Well, you didn't get a lick amiss, I reckon. You been into some
other audacious mischief when I wasn't around, like enough.
Then her conscience reproached her, and she yearned to say something
kind and loving; but she judged that this would be construed into a
confession that she had been in the wrong, and discipline forbade that.
So she kept silence, and went about her affairs with a troubled heart.
Tom sulked in a corner and exalted his woes. He knew that in her heart
his aunt was on her knees to him, and he was morosely gratified by the
consciousness of it. He would hang out no signals, he would take notice
of none. He knew that a yearning glance fell upon him, now and then,
through a film of tears, but he refused recognition of it. He pictured
himself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching
one little forgiving word, but he would turn his face to the wall, and
die with that word unsaid. Ah, how would she feel then? And he pictured
himself brought home from the river, dead, with his curls all wet, and
his sore heart at rest. How she would throw herself upon him, and how
her tears would fall like rain, and her lips pray God to give her back
her boy and she would never, never abuse him any more! But he would
lie there cold and white and make no sign--a poor little sufferer, whose
griefs were at an end. He so worked upon his feelings with the pathos of
these dreams, that he had to keep swallowing, he was so like to choke;
and his eyes swam in a blur of water, which overflowed when he winked,
and ran down and trickled from the end of his nose. And such a luxury to
him was this petting of his sorrows, that he could not bear to have any
worldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon it; it was too
sacred for such contact; and so, presently, when his cousin Mary danced
in, all alive with the joy of seeing home again after an age-long visit
of one week to the country, he got up and moved in clouds and darkness
out at one door as she brought song and sunshine in at the other.
He wandered far from the accustomed haunts of boys, and sought desolate
places that were in harmony with his spirit. A log raft in the river
invited him, and he seated himself on its outer edge and contemplated
the dreary vastness of the stream, wishing, the while, that he could
only be drowned, all at once and unconsciously, without undergoing the
uncomfortable routine devised by nature. Then he thought of his flower.
He got it out, rumpled and wilted, and it mightily increased his dismal
felicity. He wondered if she would pity him if she knew? Would she
cry, and wish that she had a right to put her arms around his neck and
comfort him? Or would she turn coldly away like all the hollow world?
This picture brought such an agony of pleasurable suffering that he
worked it over and over again in his mind and set it up in new and
varied lights, till he wore it threadbare. At last he rose up sighing
and departed in the darkness.
About half-past nine or ten o'clock he came along the deserted street to
where the Adored Unknown lived; he paused a moment; no sound fell upon
his listening ear; a candle was casting a dull glow upon the curtain
of a second-story window. Was the sacred presence there? He climbed the
fence, threaded his stealthy way through the plants, till he stood under
that window; he looked up at it long, and with emotion; then he laid him
down on the ground under it, disposing himself upon his back, with his
hands clasped upon his breast and holding his poor wilted flower.
And thus he would die--out in the cold world, with no shelter over his
homeless head, no friendly hand to wipe the death-damps from his brow,
no loving face to bend pityingly over him when the great agony came. And
thus _she_ would see him when she looked out upon the glad morning, and
oh! would she drop one little tear upon his poor, lifeless form, would
she heave one little sigh to see a bright young life so rudely blighted,
so untimely cut down?
The window went up, a maid-servant's discordant voice profaned the holy
calm, and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyr's remains!
The strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort. There was a whiz
as of a missile in the air, mingled with the murmur of a curse, a sound
as of shivering glass followed, and a small, vague form went over the
fence and shot away in the gloom.
Not long after, as Tom, all undressed for bed, was surveying his
drenched garments by the light of a tallow dip, Sid woke up; but if he
had any dim idea of making any references to allusions, he thought
better of it and held his peace, for there was danger in Tom's eye.
Tom turned in without the added vexation of prayers, and Sid made mental
note of the omission.
CHAPTER IV
THE sun rose upon a tranquil world, and beamed down upon the peaceful
village like a benediction. Breakfast over, Aunt Polly had family
worship: it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid
courses of Scriptural quotations, welded together with a thin mortar of
originality; and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter of
the Mosaic Law, as from Sinai.
Then Tom girded up his loins, so to speak, and went to work to get
his verses. Sid had learned his lesson days before. Tom bent all his
energies to the memorizing of five verses, and he chose part of the
Sermon on the Mount, because he could find no verses that were shorter.
At the end of half an hour Tom had a vague general idea of his lesson,
but no more, for his mind was traversing the whole field of human
thought, and his hands were busy with distracting recreations. Mary took
his book to hear him recite, and he tried to find his way through the
fog:
Blessed are the--a--a--
Poor--
Yes--poor; blessed are the poor--a--a--
In spirit--
In spirit; blessed are the poor in spirit, for they--they--
_Theirs_--
For _theirs_. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom
of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn, for they--they--
Sh--
For they--a--
S, H, A--
For they S, H--Oh, I don't know what it is!
_Shall_!
Oh, _shall_! for they shall--for they shall--a--a--shall mourn--a--a--blessed
are they that shall--they that--a--they that shall mourn, for they
shall--a--shall _what_? Why don't you tell me, Mary?--what do you want to
be so mean for?
Oh, Tom, you poor thick-headed thing, I'm not teasing you. I wouldn't
do that. You must go and learn it again. Don't you be discouraged, Tom,
you'll manage it--and if you do, I'll give you something ever so nice.
There, now, that's a good boy.
All right! What is it, Mary, tell me what it is.
Never you mind, Tom. You know if I say it's nice, it is nice.
You bet you that's so, Mary. All right, I'll tackle it again.
And he did tackle it again--and under the double pressure of curiosity
and prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he accomplished a
shining success. Mary gave him a brand-new Barlow knife worth twelve
and a half cents; and the convulsion of delight that swept his system
shook him to his foundations. True, the knife would not cut anything,
but it was a sure-enough Barlow, and there was inconceivable grandeur
in that--though where the Western boys ever got the idea that such a
weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing
mystery and will always remain so, perhaps. Tom contrived to scarify the
cupboard with it, and was arranging to begin on the bureau, when he was
called off to dress for Sunday-school.
Mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap, and he went
outside the door and set the basin on a little bench there; then he
dipped the soap in the water and laid it down; turned up his sleeves;
poured out the water on the ground, gently, and then entered the kitchen
and began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door. But
Mary removed the towel and said:
Now ain't you ashamed, Tom. You mustn't be so bad. Water won't hurt
you.
Tom was a trifle disconcerted. The basin was refilled, and this time he
stood over it a little while, gathering resolution; took in a big breath
and began. When he entered the kitchen presently, with both eyes shut
and groping for the towel with his hands, an honorable testimony of
suds and water was dripping from his face. But when he emerged from
the towel, he was not yet satisfactory, for the clean territory stopped
short at his chin and his jaws, like a mask; below and beyond this line
there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in
front and backward around his neck. Mary took him in hand, and when she
was done with him he was a man and a brother, without distinction of
color, and his saturated hair was neatly brushed, and its short curls
wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect. [He privately
smoothed out the curls, with labor and difficulty, and plastered his
hair close down to his head; for he held curls to be effeminate, and his
own filled his life with bitterness.] Then Mary got out a suit of his
clothing that had been used only on Sundays during two years--they were
simply called his other clothes--and so by that we know the size of his
wardrobe. The girl put him to rights after he had dressed himself;
she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin, turned his vast shirt
collar down over his shoulders, brushed him off and crowned him with
his speckled straw hat. He now looked exceedingly improved and
uncomfortable. He was fully as uncomfortable as he looked; for there
was a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him. He
hoped that Mary would forget his shoes, but the hope was blighted; she
coated them thoroughly with tallow, as was the custom, and brought
them out. He lost his temper and said he was always being made to do
everything he didn't want to do. But Mary said, persuasively:
Please, Tom--that's a good boy.
So he got into the shoes snarling. Mary was soon ready, and the three
children set out for Sunday-school--a place that Tom hated with his whole
heart; but Sid and Mary were fond of it.
Sabbath-school hours were from nine to half-past ten; and then church
service. Two of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily,
and the other always remained too--for stronger reasons. The church's
high-backed, uncushioned pews would seat about three hundred persons;
the edifice was but a small, plain affair, with a sort of pine board
tree-box on top of it for a steeple. At the door Tom dropped back a step
and accosted a Sunday-dressed comrade:
Say, Billy, got a yaller ticket?
Yes.
What'll you take for her?
What'll you give?
Piece of lickrish and a fish-hook.
Less see 'em.
Tom exhibited. They were satisfactory, and the property changed hands.
Then Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets, and some
small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones. He waylaid other
boys as they came, and went on buying tickets of various colors ten
or fifteen minutes longer. He entered the church, now, with a swarm
of clean and noisy boys and girls, proceeded to his seat and started
a quarrel with the first boy that came handy. The teacher, a grave,
elderly man, interfered; then turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a
boy's hair in the next bench, and was absorbed in his book when the boy
turned around; stuck a pin in another boy, presently, in order to hear
him say Ouch! and got a new reprimand from his teacher. Tom's whole
class were of a pattern--restless, noisy, and troublesome. When they came
to recite their lessons, not one of them knew his verses perfectly, but
had to be prompted all along. However, they worried through, and each
got his reward--in small blue tickets, each with a passage of Scripture
on it; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation. Ten
blue tickets equalled a red one, and could be exchanged for it; ten red
tickets equalled a yellow one; for ten yellow tickets the superintendent
gave a very plainly bound Bible (worth forty cents in those easy
times) to the pupil. How many of my readers would have the industry and
application to memorize two thousand verses, even for a Dore Bible? And
yet Mary had acquired two Bibles in this way--it was the patient work of
two years--and a boy of German parentage had won four or five. He once
recited three thousand verses without stopping; but the strain upon his
mental faculties was too great, and he was little better than an idiot
from that day forth--a grievous misfortune for the school, for on great
occasions, before company, the superintendent (as Tom expressed it)
had always made this boy come out and spread himself. Only the older
pupils managed to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work
long enough to get a Bible, and so the delivery of one of these prizes
was a rare and noteworthy circumstance; the successful pupil was so
great and conspicuous for that day that on the spot every scholar's
heart was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted a couple
of weeks. It is possible that Tom's mental stomach had never really
hungered for one of those prizes, but unquestionably his entire being
had for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat that came with it.
In due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit, with
a closed hymn-book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its
leaves, and commanded attention. When a Sunday-school superintendent
makes his customary little speech, a hymn-book in the hand is as
necessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer
who stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert--though
why, is a mystery: for neither the hymn-book nor the sheet of music
is ever referred to by the sufferer. This superintendent was a slim
creature of thirty-five, with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair; he
wore a stiff standing-collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears
and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth--a
fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead, and a turning of the
whole body when a side view was required; his chin was propped on a
spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank-note, and had
fringed ends; his boot toes were turned sharply up, in the fashion
of the day, like sleigh-runners--an effect patiently and laboriously
produced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a
wall for hours together. Mr. Walters was very earnest of mien, and very
sincere and honest at heart; and he held sacred things and places
in such reverence, and so separated them from worldly matters, that
unconsciously to himself his Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar
intonation which was wholly absent on week-days. He began after this
fashion:
Now, children, I want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as
you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two. There--that
is it. That is the way good little boys and girls should do. I see one
little girl who is looking out of the window--I am afraid she thinks I
am out there somewhere--perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech
to the little birds. [Applausive titter.] I want to tell you how good it
makes me feel to see so many bright, clean little faces assembled in a
place like this, learning to do right and be good. And so forth and so
on. It is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration. It was of a
pattern which does not vary, and so it is familiar to us all.
The latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights
and other recreations among certain of the bad boys, and by fidgetings
and whisperings that extended far and wide, washing even to the bases of
isolated and incorruptible rocks like Sid and Mary. But now every sound
ceased suddenly, with the subsidence of Mr. Walters' voice, and the
conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent gratitude.
A good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was
more or less rare--the entrance of visitors: lawyer Thatcher, accompanied
by a very feeble and aged man; a fine, portly, middle-aged gentleman
with iron-gray hair; and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter's
wife. The lady was leading a child. Tom had been restless and full of
chafings and repinings; conscience-smitten, too--he could not meet Amy
Lawrence's eye, he could not brook her loving gaze. But when he saw this
small newcomer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment. The next
moment he was showing off with all his might--cuffing boys, pulling
hair, making faces--in a word, using every art that seemed likely to
fascinate a girl and win her applause. His exaltation had but one
alloy--the memory of his humiliation in this angel's garden--and that
record in sand was fast washing out, under the waves of happiness that
were sweeping over it now.
The visitors were given the highest seat of honor, and as soon as Mr.
Walters' speech was finished, he introduced them to the school. The
middle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage--no less a one
than the county judge--altogether the most august creation these children
had ever looked upon--and they wondered what kind of material he was made
of--and they half wanted to hear him roar, and were half afraid he might,
too. He was from Constantinople, twelve miles away--so he had travelled,
and seen the world--these very eyes had looked upon the county
court-house--which was said to have a tin roof. The awe which these
reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence and the
ranks of staring eyes. This was the great Judge Thatcher, brother of
their own lawyer. Jeff Thatcher immediately went forward, to be familiar
with the great man and be envied by the school. It would have been music
to his soul to hear the whisperings:
Look at him, Jim! He's a going up there. Say--look! he's a going to
shake hands with him--he _is_ shaking hands with him! By jings, don't you
wish you was Jeff?
Mr. Walters fell to showing off, with all sorts of official bustlings
and activities, giving orders, delivering judgments, discharging
directions here, there, everywhere that he could find a target. The
librarian showed off--running hither and thither with his arms full of
books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that insect authority
delights in. The young lady teachers showed off--bending sweetly over
pupils that were lately being boxed, lifting pretty warning fingers
at bad little boys and patting good ones lovingly. The young gentlemen
teachers showed off with small scoldings and other little displays of
authority and fine attention to discipline--and most of the teachers, of
both sexes, found business up at the library, by the pulpit; and it was
business that frequently had to be done over again two or three times
(with much seeming vexation). The little girls showed off in various
ways, and the little boys showed off with such diligence that the air
was thick with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings. And above it
all the great man sat and beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all
the house, and warmed himself in the sun of his own grandeur--for he was
showing off, too.
There was only one thing wanting to make Mr. Walters' ecstasy complete,
and that was a chance to deliver a Bible-prize and exhibit a prodigy.
Several pupils had a few yellow tickets, but none had enough--he had been
around among the star pupils inquiring. He would have given worlds, now,
to have that German lad back again with a sound mind.
And now at this moment, when hope was dead, Tom Sawyer came forward with
nine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and demanded
a Bible. This was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. Walters was not
expecting an application from this source for the next ten years. But
there was no getting around it--here were the certified checks, and they
were good for their face. Tom was therefore elevated to a place with
the Judge and the other elect, and the great news was announced from
headquarters. It was the most stunning surprise of the decade, and
so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up to the
judicial one's altitude, and the school had two marvels to gaze upon
in place of one. The boys were all eaten up with envy--but those that
suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too late that they
themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by trading tickets to
Tom for the wealth he had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges.
These despised themselves, as being the dupes of a wily fraud, a
guileful snake in the grass.
The prize was delivered to Tom with as much effusion as the
superintendent could pump up under the circumstances; but it lacked
somewhat of the true gush, for the poor fellow's instinct taught him
that there was a mystery here that could not well bear the light,
perhaps; it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two
thousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on his premises--a dozen would
strain his capacity, without a doubt.
Amy Lawrence was proud and glad, and she tried to make Tom see it in
her face--but he wouldn't look. She wondered; then she was just a grain
troubled; next a dim suspicion came and went--came again; she watched;
a furtive glance told her worlds--and then her heart broke, and she was
jealous, and angry, and the tears came and she hated everybody. Tom most
of all (she thought).
Tom was introduced to the Judge; but his tongue was tied, his breath
would hardly come, his heart quaked--partly because of the awful
greatness of the man, but mainly because he was her parent. He would
have liked to fall down and worship him, if it were in the dark. The
Judge put his hand on Tom's head and called him a fine little man, and
asked him what his name was. The boy stammered, gasped, and got it out:
Tom.
Oh, no, not Tom--it is--
Thomas.
Ah, that's it. I thought there was more to it, maybe. That's very well.
But you've another one I daresay, and you'll tell it to me, won't you?
Tell the gentleman your other name, Thomas, said Walters, and say
sir. You mustn't forget your manners.
Thomas Sawyer--sir.
That's it! That's a good boy. Fine boy. Fine, manly little fellow. Two
thousand verses is a great many--very, very great many. And you never can
be sorry for the trouble you took to learn them; for knowledge is worth
more than anything there is in the world; it's what makes great men
and good men; you'll be a great man and a good man yourself, some
day, Thomas, and then you'll look back and say, It's all owing to the
precious Sunday-school privileges of my boyhood--it's all owing to
my dear teachers that taught me to learn--it's all owing to the good
superintendent, who encouraged me, and watched over me, and gave me a
beautiful Bible--a splendid elegant Bible--to keep and have it all for my
own, always--it's all owing to right bringing up! That is what you will
say, Thomas--and you wouldn't take any money for those two thousand
verses--no indeed you wouldn't. And now you wouldn't mind telling me and
this lady some of the things you've learned--no, I know you wouldn't--for
we are proud of little boys that learn. Now, no doubt you know the names
of all the twelve disciples. Won't you tell us the names of the first
two that were appointed?
Tom was tugging at a button-hole and looking sheepish. He blushed,
now, and his eyes fell. Mr. Walters' heart sank within him. He said
to himself, it is not possible that the boy can answer the simplest
question--why _did_ the Judge ask him? Yet he felt obliged to speak up
and say:
Answer the gentleman, Thomas--don't be afraid.
Tom still hung fire.
Now I know you'll tell me, said the lady. The names of the first two
disciples were--
_David And Goliah!_
Let us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the scene.
CHAPTER V
ABOUT half-past ten the cracked bell of the small church began to ring,
and presently the people began to gather for the morning sermon. The
Sunday-school children distributed themselves about the house and
occupied pews with their parents, so as to be under supervision. Aunt
Polly came, and Tom and Sid and Mary sat with her--Tom being placed next
the aisle, in order that he might be as far away from the open window
and the seductive outside summer scenes as possible. The crowd filed up
the aisles: the aged and needy postmaster, who had seen better days;
the mayor and his wife--for they had a mayor there, among other
unnecessaries; the justice of the peace; the widow Douglass, fair,
smart, and forty, a generous, good-hearted soul and well-to-do, her hill
mansion the only palace in the town, and the most hospitable and much
the most lavish in the matter of festivities that St. Petersburg could
boast; the bent and venerable Major and Mrs. Ward; lawyer Riverson, the
new notable from a distance; next the belle of the village, followed by
a troop of lawn-clad and ribbon-decked young heart-breakers; then all
the young clerks in town in a body--for they had stood in the vestibule
sucking their cane-heads, a circling wall of oiled and simpering
admirers, till the last girl had run their gantlet; and last of all came
the Model Boy, Willie Mufferson, taking as heedful care of his mother as
if she were cut glass. He always brought his mother to church, and was
the pride of all the matrons. The boys all hated him, he was so
good. And besides, he had been thrown up to them so much. His
white handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind, as usual on
Sundays--accidentally. Tom had no handkerchief, and he looked upon boys
who had as snobs.
The congregation being fully assembled, now, the bell rang once more,
to warn laggards and stragglers, and then a solemn hush fell upon the
church which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the
choir in the gallery. The choir always tittered and whispered all
through service. There was once a church choir that was not ill-bred,
but I have forgotten where it was, now. It was a great many years ago,
and I can scarcely remember anything about it, but I think it was in
some foreign country.
The minister gave out the hymn, and read it through with a relish, in a
peculiar style which was much admired in that part of the country. His
voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached a
certain point, where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost word
and then plunged down as if from a spring-board:
Shall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies, on flow'ry _beds_ of ease,
Whilst others fight to win the prize, and sail thro' _blood_-y seas?
He was regarded as a wonderful reader. At church sociables he was
always called upon to read poetry; and when he was through, the ladies
would lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps,
and wall their eyes, and shake their heads, as much as to say, Words
cannot express it; it is too beautiful, TOO beautiful for this mortal
earth.
After the hymn had been sung, the Rev. Mr. Sprague turned himself into
a bulletin-board, and read off notices of meetings and societies and
things till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of
doom--a queer custom which is still kept up in America, even in cities,
away here in this age of abundant newspapers. Often, the less there is
to justify a traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of it.
And now the minister prayed. A good, generous prayer it was, and went
into details: it pleaded for the church, and the little children of the
church; for the other churches of the village; for the village itself;
for the county; for the State; for the State officers; for the United
States; for the churches of the United States; for Congress; for the
President; for the officers of the Government; for poor sailors, tossed
by stormy seas; for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of
European monarchies and Oriental despotisms; for such as have the light
and the good tidings, and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear
withal; for the heathen in the far islands of the sea; and closed with
a supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace
and favor, and be as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding in time a
grateful harvest of good. Amen.
There was a rustling of dresses, and the standing congregation sat down.
The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer, he
only endured it--if he even did that much. He was restive all through it;
he kept tally of the details of the prayer, unconsciously--for he was not
listening, but he knew the ground of old, and the clergyman's regular
route over it--and when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded,
his ear detected it and his whole nature resented it; he considered
additions unfair, and scoundrelly. In the midst of the prayer a fly had
lit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by
calmly rubbing its hands together, embracing its head with its arms, and
polishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part company with
the body, and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view; scraping
its wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they
had been coat-tails; going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if
it knew it was perfectly safe. As indeed it was; for as sorely as Tom's
hands itched to grab for it they did not dare--he believed his soul would
be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the prayer was going
on. But with the closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal
forward; and the instant the Amen was out the fly was a prisoner of
war. His aunt detected the act and made him let it go.
The minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through an
argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod--and
yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone and
thinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be hardly
worth the saving. Tom counted the pages of the sermon; after church he
always knew how many pages there had been, but he seldom knew anything
else about the discourse. However, this time he was really interested
for a little while. The minister made a grand and moving picture of the
assembling together of the world's hosts at the millennium when the lion
and the lamb should lie down together and a little child should lead
them. But the pathos, the lesson, the moral of the great spectacle
were lost upon the boy; he only thought of the conspicuousness of the
principal character before the on-looking nations; his face lit with the
thought, and he said to himself that he wished he could be that child,
if it was a tame lion.
Now he lapsed into suffering again, as the dry argument was resumed.
Presently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out. It was
a large black beetle with formidable jaws--a pinchbug, he called it. It
was in a percussion-cap box. The first thing the beetle did was to
take him by the finger. A natural fillip followed, the beetle went
floundering into the aisle and lit on its back, and the hurt finger went
into the boy's mouth. The beetle lay there working its helpless legs,
unable to turn over. Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was safe out
of his reach. Other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in
the beetle, and they eyed it too. Presently a vagrant poodle dog came
idling along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness and the
quiet, weary of captivity, sighing for change. He spied the beetle; the
drooping tail lifted and wagged. He surveyed the prize; walked around
it; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it again; grew
bolder, and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly
snatch at it, just missing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy
the diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws,
and continued his experiments; grew weary at last, and then indifferent
and absent-minded. His head nodded, and little by little his chin
descended and touched the enemy, who seized it. There was a sharp yelp,
a flirt of the poodle's head, and the beetle fell a couple of yards
away, and lit on its back once more. The neighboring spectators
shook with a gentle inward joy, several faces went behind fans and
hand-kerchiefs, and Tom was entirely happy. The dog looked foolish,
and probably felt so; but there was resentment in his heart, too, and a
craving for revenge. So he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on
it again; jumping at it from every point of a circle, lighting with his
fore-paws within an inch of the creature, making even closer snatches at
it with his teeth, and jerking his head till his ears flapped again. But
he grew tired once more, after a while; tried to amuse himself with a
fly but found no relief; followed an ant around, with his nose close
to the floor, and quickly wearied of that; yawned, sighed, forgot the
beetle entirely, and sat down on it. Then there was a wild yelp of agony
and the poodle went sailing up the aisle; the yelps continued, and so
did the dog; he crossed the house in front of the altar; he flew
down the other aisle; he crossed before the doors; he clamored up the
home-stretch; his anguish grew with his progress, till presently he was
but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the speed of
light. At last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course, and sprang
into its master's lap; he flung it out of the window, and the voice of
distress quickly thinned away and died in the distance.
By this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating with
suppressed laughter, and the sermon had come to a dead standstill.
The discourse was resumed presently, but it went lame and halting, all
possibility of impressiveness being at an end; for even the gravest
sentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst of
unholy mirth, under cover of some remote pew-back, as if the poor parson
had said a rarely facetious thing. It was a genuine relief to the whole
congregation when the ordeal was over and the benediction pronounced.
Tom Sawyer went home quite cheerful, thinking to himself that there was
some satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of variety
in it. He had but one marring thought; he was willing that the dog
should play with his pinchbug, but he did not think it was upright in
him to carry it off.
CHAPTER VI
MONDAY morning found Tom Sawyer miserable. Monday morning always found
him so--because it began another week's slow suffering in school. He
generally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening holiday,
it made the going into captivity and fetters again so much more odious.
Tom lay thinking. Presently it occurred to him that he wished he was
sick; then he could stay home from school. Here was a vague possibility.
He canvassed his system. No ailment was found, and he investigated
again. This time he thought he could detect colicky symptoms, and he
began to encourage them with considerable hope. But they soon grew
feeble, and presently died wholly away. He reflected further. Suddenly
he discovered something. One of his upper front teeth was loose. This
was lucky; he was about to begin to groan, as a starter, as he
called it, when it occurred to him that if he came into court with that
argument, his aunt would pull it out, and that would hurt. So he thought
he would hold the tooth in reserve for the present, and seek further.
Nothing offered for some little time, and then he remembered hearing
the doctor tell about a certain thing that laid up a patient for two or
three weeks and threatened to make him lose a finger. So the boy eagerly
drew his sore toe from under the sheet and held it up for inspection.
But now he did not know the necessary symptoms. However, it seemed
well worth while to chance it, so he fell to groaning with considerable
spirit.
But Sid slept on unconscious.
Tom groaned louder, and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe.
No result from Sid.
Tom was panting with his exertions by this time. He took a rest and then
swelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans.
Sid snored on.
Tom was aggravated. He said, Sid, Sid! and shook him. This course
worked well, and Tom began to groan again. Sid yawned, stretched, then
brought himself up on his elbow with a snort, and began to stare at Tom.
Tom went on groaning. Sid said:
Tom! Say, Tom! [No response.] Here, Tom! TOM! What is the matter,
Tom? And he shook him and looked in his face anxiously.
Tom moaned out:
Oh, don't, Sid. Don't joggle me.
Why, what's the matter, Tom? I must call auntie.
No--never mind. It'll be over by and by, maybe. Don't call anybody.
But I must! _Don't_ groan so, Tom, it's awful. How long you been this
way?
Hours. Ouch! Oh, don't stir so, Sid, you'll kill me.
Tom, why didn't you wake me sooner? Oh, Tom, _don't!_ It makes my flesh
crawl to hear you. Tom, what is the matter?
I forgive you everything, Sid. [Groan.] Everything you've ever done to
me. When I'm gone--
Oh, Tom, you ain't dying, are you? Don't, Tom--oh, don't. Maybe--
I forgive everybody, Sid. [Groan.] Tell 'em so, Sid. And Sid, you give
my window-sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl that's come to
town, and tell her--
But Sid had snatched his clothes and gone. Tom was suffering in reality,
now, so handsomely was his imagination working, and so his groans had
gathered quite a genuine tone.
Sid flew downstairs and said:
Oh, Aunt Polly, come! Tom's dying!
Dying!
Yes'm. Don't wait--come quick!
Rubbage! I don't believe it!
But she fled upstairs, nevertheless, with Sid and Mary at her heels.
And her face grew white, too, and her lip trembled. When she reached the
bedside she gasped out:
You, Tom! Tom, what's the matter with you?
Oh, auntie, I'm--
What's the matter with you--what is the matter with you, child?
Oh, auntie, my sore toe's mortified!
The old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little, then cried a
little, then did both together. This restored her and she said:
Tom, what a turn you did give me. Now you shut up that nonsense and
climb out of this.
The groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe. The boy felt a
little foolish, and he said:
Aunt Polly, it _seemed_ mortified, and it hurt so I never minded my
tooth at all.
Your tooth, indeed! What's the matter with your tooth?
One of them's loose, and it aches perfectly awful.
There, there, now, don't begin that groaning again. Open your mouth.
Well--your tooth _is_ loose, but you're not going to die about that.
Mary, get me a silk thread, and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen.
Tom said:
Oh, please, auntie, don't pull it out. It don't hurt any more. I wish
I may never stir if it does. Please don't, auntie. I don't want to stay
home from school.
Oh, you don't, don't you? So all this row was because you thought you'd
get to stay home from school and go a-fishing? Tom, Tom, I love you so,
and you seem to try every way you can to break my old heart with your
outrageousness. By this time the dental instruments were ready. The old
lady made one end of the silk thread fast to Tom's tooth with a loop
and tied the other to the bedpost. Then she seized the chunk of fire and
suddenly thrust it almost into the boy's face. The tooth hung dangling
by the bedpost, now.
But all trials bring their compensations. As Tom wended to school after
breakfast, he was the envy of every boy he met because the gap in his
upper row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and admirable
way. He gathered quite a following of lads interested in the exhibition;
and one that had cut his finger and had been a centre of fascination and
homage up to this time, now found himself suddenly without an adherent,
and shorn of his glory. His heart was heavy, and he said with a disdain
which he did not feel that it wasn't anything to spit like Tom Sawyer;
but another boy said, Sour grapes! and he wandered away a dismantled
hero.
Shortly Tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village, Huckleberry
Finn, son of the town drunkard. Huckleberry was cordially hated and
dreaded by all the mothers of the town, because he was idle and lawless
and vulgar and bad--and because all their children admired him so, and
delighted in his forbidden society, and wished they dared to be like
him. Tom was like the rest of the respectable boys, in that he envied
Huckleberry his gaudy outcast condition, and was under strict orders
not to play with him. So he played with him every time he got a chance.
Huckleberry was always dressed in the cast-off clothes of full-grown
men, and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags. His hat
was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim; his coat,
when he wore one, hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons
far down the back; but one suspender supported his trousers; the seat of
the trousers bagged low and contained nothing, the fringed legs dragged
in the dirt when not rolled up.
Huckleberry came and went, at his own free will. He slept on doorsteps
in fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not have to go to
school or to church, or call any being master or obey anybody; he could
go fishing or swimming when and where he chose, and stay as long as it
suited him; nobody forbade him to fight; he could sit up as late as he
pleased; he was always the first boy that went barefoot in the spring
and the last to resume leather in the fall; he never had to wash, nor
put on clean clothes; he could swear wonderfully. In a word, everything
that goes to make life precious that boy had. So thought every harassed,
hampered, respectable boy in St. Petersburg.
Tom hailed the romantic outcast:
Hello, Huckleberry!
Hello yourself, and see how you like it.
What's that you got?
Dead cat.
Lemme see him, Huck. My, he's pretty stiff. Where'd you get him?
Bought him off'n a boy.
What did you give?
I give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got at the slaughter-house.
Where'd you get the blue ticket?
Bought it off'n Ben Rogers two weeks ago for a hoop-stick.
Say--what is dead cats good for, Huck?
Good for? Cure warts with.
No! Is that so? I know something that's better.
I bet you don't. What is it?
Why, spunk-water.
Spunk-water! I wouldn't give a dern for spunk-water.
You wouldn't, wouldn't you? D'you ever try it?
No, I hain't. But Bob Tanner did.
Who told you so!
Why, he told Jeff Thatcher, and Jeff told Johnny Baker, and Johnny
told Jim Hollis, and Jim told Ben Rogers, and Ben told a nigger, and the
nigger told me. There now!
Well, what of it? They'll all lie. Leastways all but the nigger. I
don't know _him_. But I never see a nigger that _wouldn't_ lie. Shucks!
Now you tell me how Bob Tanner done it, Huck.
Why, he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the rain-water
was.
In the daytime?
Certainly.
With his face to the stump?
Yes. Least I reckon so.
Did he say anything?
I don't reckon he did. I don't know.
Aha! Talk about trying to cure warts with spunk-water such a blame fool
way as that! Why, that ain't a-going to do any good. You got to go all
by yourself, to the middle of the woods, where you know there's a
spunk-water stump, and just as it's midnight you back up against the stump
and jam your hand in and say:
'Barley-corn, barley-corn, injun-meal shorts, Spunk-water, spunk-water,
swaller these warts,'
and then walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and then
turn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody.
Because if you speak the charm's busted.
Well, that sounds like a good way; but that ain't the way Bob Tanner
done.
No, sir, you can bet he didn't, becuz he's the wartiest boy in this
town; and he wouldn't have a wart on him if he'd knowed how to work
spunk-water. I've took off thousands of warts off of my hands that way,
Huck. I play with frogs so much that I've always got considerable many
warts. Sometimes I take 'em off with a bean.
Yes, bean's good. I've done that.
Have you? What's your way?
You take and split the bean, and cut the wart so as to get some blood,
and then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take and dig
a hole and bury it 'bout midnight at the crossroads in the dark of the
moon, and then you burn up the rest of the bean. You see that piece
that's got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing, trying to
fetch the other piece to it, and so that helps the blood to draw the
wart, and pretty soon off she comes.
Yes, that's it, Huck--that's it; though when you're burying it if you
say 'Down bean; off wart; come no more to bother me!' it's better.
That's the way Joe Harper does, and he's been nearly to Coonville and
most everywheres. But say--how do you cure 'em with dead cats?
Why, you take your cat and go and get in the grave-yard 'long about
midnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried; and when it's
midnight a devil will come, or maybe two or three, but you can't see
'em, you can only hear something like the wind, or maybe hear 'em talk;
and when they're taking that feller away, you heave your cat after 'em
and say, 'Devil follow corpse, cat follow devil, warts follow cat, I'm
done with ye!' That'll fetch _any_ wart.
Sounds right. D'you ever try it, Huck?
No, but old Mother Hopkins told me.
Well, I reckon it's so, then. Becuz they say she's a witch.
Say! Why, Tom, I _know_ she is. She witched pap. Pap says so his own
self. He come along one day, and he see she was a-witching him, so he
took up a rock, and if she hadn't dodged, he'd a got her. Well, that
very night he rolled off'n a shed wher' he was a layin drunk, and broke
his arm.
Why, that's awful. How did he know she was a-witching him?
Lord, pap can tell, easy. Pap says when they keep looking at you right
stiddy, they're a-witching you. Specially if they mumble. Becuz when
they mumble they're saying the Lord's Prayer backards.
Say, Hucky, when you going to try the cat?
To-night. I reckon they'll come after old Hoss Williams to-night.
But they buried him Saturday. Didn't they get him Saturday night?
Why, how you talk! How could their charms work till midnight?--and
_then_ it's Sunday. Devils don't slosh around much of a Sunday, I don't
reckon.
I never thought of that. That's so. Lemme go with you?
Of course--if you ain't afeard.
Afeard! 'Tain't likely. Will you meow?
Yes--and you meow back, if you get a chance. Last time, you kep' me
a-meowing around till old Hays went to throwing rocks at me and says
'Dern that cat!' and so I hove a brick through his window--but don't you
tell.
I won't. I couldn't meow that night, becuz auntie was watching me, but
I'll meow this time. Say--what's that?
Nothing but a tick.
Where'd you get him?
Out in the woods.
What'll you take for him?
I don't know. I don't want to sell him.
All right. It's a mighty small tick, anyway.
Oh, anybody can run a tick down that don't belong to them. I'm
satisfied with it. It's a good enough tick for me.
Sho, there's ticks a plenty. I could have a thousand of 'em if I wanted
to.
Well, why don't you? Becuz you know mighty well you can't. This is a
pretty early tick, I reckon. It's the first one I've seen this year.
Say, Huck--I'll give you my tooth for him.
Less see it.
Tom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it. Huckleberry viewed
it wistfully. The temptation was very strong. At last he said:
Is it genuwyne?
Tom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy.
Well, all right, said Huckleberry, it's a trade.
Tom enclosed the tick in the percussion-cap box that had lately been the
pinchbug's prison, and the boys separated, each feeling wealthier than
before.
When Tom reached the little isolated frame school-house, he strode in
briskly, with the manner of one who had come with all honest speed. He
hung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his seat with business-like
alacrity. The master, throned on high in his great splint-bottom
arm-chair, was dozing, lulled by the drowsy hum of study. The
interruption roused him.
Thomas Sawyer!
Tom knew that when his name was pronounced in full, it meant trouble.
Sir!
Come up here. Now, sir, why are you late again, as usual?
Tom was about to take refuge in a lie, when he saw two long tails of
yellow hair hanging down a back that he recognized by the electric
sympathy of love; and by that form was _the only vacant place_ on the
girls' side of the school-house. He instantly said:
_I stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn!_
The master's pulse stood still, and he stared helplessly. The buzz of
study ceased. The pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost his
mind. The master said:
You--you did what?
Stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn.
There was no mistaking the words.
Thomas Sawyer, this is the most astounding confession I have ever
listened to. No mere ferule will answer for this offence. Take off your
jacket.
The master's arm performed until it was tired and the stock of switches
notably diminished. Then the order followed:
Now, sir, go and sit with the girls! And let this be a warning to you.
The titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy, but
in reality that result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe
of his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay in his high good
fortune. He sat down upon the end of the pine bench and the girl hitched
herself away from him with a toss of her head. Nudges and winks and
whispers traversed the room, but Tom sat still, with his arms upon the
long, low desk before him, and seemed to study his book.
By and by attention ceased from him, and the accustomed school murmur
rose upon the dull air once more. Presently the boy began to steal
furtive glances at the girl. She observed it, made a mouth at him
and gave him the back of her head for the space of a minute. When she
cautiously faced around again, a peach lay before her. She thrust it
away. Tom gently put it back. She thrust it away again, but with less
animosity. Tom patiently returned it to its place. Then she let it
remain. Tom scrawled on his slate, Please take it--I got more. The
girl glanced at the words, but made no sign. Now the boy began to draw
something on the slate, hiding his work with his left hand. For a time
the girl refused to notice; but her human curiosity presently began
to manifest itself by hardly perceptible signs. The boy worked on,
apparently unconscious. The girl made a sort of non-committal attempt
to see, but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it. At last she
gave in and hesitatingly whispered:
Let me see it.
Tom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable ends
to it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney. Then the girl's
interest began to fasten itself upon the work and she forgot everything
else. When it was finished, she gazed a moment, then whispered:
It's nice--make a man.
The artist erected a man in the front yard, that resembled a derrick. He
could have stepped over the house; but the girl was not hypercritical;
she was satisfied with the monster, and whispered:
It's a beautiful man--now make me coming along.
Tom drew an hour-glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it and armed
the spreading fingers with a portentous fan. The girl said:
It's ever so nice--I wish I could draw.
It's easy, whispered Tom, I'll learn you.
Oh, will you? When?
At noon. Do you go home to dinner?
I'll stay if you will.
Good--that's a whack. What's your name?
Becky Thatcher. What's yours? Oh, I know. It's Thomas Sawyer.
That's the name they lick me by. I'm Tom when I'm good. You call me
Tom, will you?
Yes.
Now Tom began to scrawl something on the slate, hiding the words from
the girl. But she was not backward this time. She begged to see. Tom
said:
Oh, it ain't anything.
Yes it is.
No it ain't. You don't want to see.
Yes I do, indeed I do. Please let me.
You'll tell.
No I won't--deed and deed and double deed won't.
You won't tell anybody at all? Ever, as long as you live?
No, I won't ever tell _any_body. Now let me.
Oh, _you_ don't want to see!
Now that you treat me so, I _will_ see. And she put her small hand
upon his and a little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending to resist in
earnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words were
revealed: _I love you_.
Oh, you bad thing! And she hit his hand a smart rap, but reddened and
looked pleased, nevertheless.
Just at this juncture the boy felt a slow, fateful grip closing on his
ear, and a steady lifting impulse. In that wise he was borne across the
house and deposited in his own seat, under a peppering fire of giggles
from the whole school. Then the master stood over him during a few awful
moments, and finally moved away to his throne without saying a word. But
although Tom's ear tingled, his heart was jubilant.
As the school quieted down Tom made an honest effort to study, but
the turmoil within him was too great. In turn he took his place in the
reading class and made a botch of it; then in the geography class and
turned lakes into mountains, mountains into rivers, and rivers into
continents, till chaos was come again; then in the spelling class, and
got turned down, by a succession of mere baby words, till he brought
up at the foot and yielded up the pewter medal which he had worn with
ostentation for months.
CHAPTER VII
THE harder Tom tried to fasten his mind on his book, the more his ideas
wandered. So at last, with a sigh and a yawn, he gave it up. It seemed
to him that the noon recess would never come. The air was utterly dead.
There was not a breath stirring. It was the sleepiest of sleepy days.
The drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed
the soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees. Away off in the
flaming sunshine, Cardiff Hill lifted its soft green sides through a
shimmering veil of heat, tinted with the purple of distance; a few birds
floated on lazy wing high in the air; no other living thing was visible
but some cows, and they were asleep. Tom's heart ached to be free, or
else to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time.
His hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of
gratitude that was prayer, though he did not know it. Then furtively
the percussion-cap box came out. He released the tick and put him on
the long flat desk. The creature probably glowed with a gratitude that
amounted to prayer, too, at this moment, but it was premature: for when
he started thankfully to travel off, Tom turned him aside with a pin and
made him take a new direction.
Tom's bosom friend sat next him, suffering just as Tom had been, and
now he was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in
an instant. This bosom friend was Joe Harper. The two boys were sworn
friends all the week, and embattled enemies on Saturdays. Joe took a
pin out of his lapel and began to assist in exercising the prisoner.
The sport grew in interest momently. Soon Tom said that they were
interfering with each other, and neither getting the fullest benefit
of the tick. So he put Joe's slate on the desk and drew a line down the
middle of it from top to bottom.
Now, said he, as long as he is on your side you can stir him up and
I'll let him alone; but if you let him get away and get on my side,
you're to leave him alone as long as I can keep him from crossing over.
All right, go ahead; start him up.
The tick escaped from Tom, presently, and crossed the equator. Joe
harassed him awhile, and then he got away and crossed back again. This
change of base occurred often. While one boy was worrying the tick with
absorbing interest, the other would look on with interest as strong, the
two heads bowed together over the slate, and the two souls dead to all
things else. At last luck seemed to settle and abide with Joe. The
tick tried this, that, and the other course, and got as excited and as
anxious as the boys themselves, but time and again just as he would
have victory in his very grasp, so to speak, and Tom's fingers would
be twitching to begin, Joe's pin would deftly head him off, and keep
possession. At last Tom could stand it no longer. The temptation was too
strong. So he reached out and lent a hand with his pin. Joe was angry in
a moment. Said he:
Tom, you let him alone.
I only just want to stir him up a little, Joe.
No, sir, it ain't fair; you just let him alone.
Blame it, I ain't going to stir him much.
Let him alone, I tell you.
I won't!
You shall--he's on my side of the line.
Look here, Joe Harper, whose is that tick?
I don't care whose tick he is--he's on my side of the line, and you
sha'n't touch him.
Well, I'll just bet I will, though. He's my tick and I'll do what I
blame please with him, or die!
A tremendous whack came down on Tom's shoulders, and its duplicate on
Joe's; and for the space of two minutes the dust continued to fly from
the two jackets and the whole school to enjoy it. The boys had been
too absorbed to notice the hush that had stolen upon the school awhile
before when the master came tiptoeing down the room and stood over them.
He had contemplated a good part of the performance before he contributed
his bit of variety to it.
When school broke up at noon, Tom flew to Becky Thatcher, and whispered
in her ear:
Put on your bonnet and let on you're going home; and when you get to
the corner, give the rest of 'em the slip, and turn down through the
lane and come back. I'll go the other way and come it over 'em the same
way.
So the one went off with one group of scholars, and the other with
another. In a little while the two met at the bottom of the lane, and
when they reached the school they had it all to themselves. Then they
sat together, with a slate before them, and Tom gave Becky the pencil
and held her hand in his, guiding it, and so created another surprising
house. When the interest in art began to wane, the two fell to talking.
Tom was swimming in bliss. He said:
Do you love rats?
No! I hate them!
Well, I do, too--_live_ ones. But I mean dead ones, to swing round your
head with a string.
No, I don't care for rats much, anyway. What I like is chewing-gum.
Oh, I should say so! I wish I had some now.
Do you? I've got some. I'll let you chew it awhile, but you must give
it back to me.
That was agreeable, so they chewed it turn about, and dangled their legs
against the bench in excess of contentment.
Was you ever at a circus? said Tom.
Yes, and my pa's going to take me again some time, if I'm good.
I been to the circus three or four times--lots of times. Church ain't
shucks to a circus. There's things going on at a circus all the time.
I'm going to be a clown in a circus when I grow up.
Oh, are you! That will be nice. They're so lovely, all spotted up.
Yes, that's so. And they get slathers of money--most a dollar a day, Ben
Rogers says. Say, Becky, was you ever engaged?
What's that?
Why, engaged to be married.
No.
Would you like to?
I reckon so. I don't know. What is it like?
Like? Why it ain't like anything. You only just tell a boy you won't
ever have anybody but him, ever ever ever, and then you kiss and that's
all. Anybody can do it.
Kiss? What do you kiss for?
Why, that, you know, is to--well, they always do that.
Everybody?
Why, yes, everybody that's in love with each other. Do you remember
what I wrote on the slate?
Ye--yes.
What was it?
I sha'n't tell you.
Shall I tell _you_?
Ye--yes--but some other time.
No, now.
No, not now--to-morrow.
Oh, no, _now_. Please, Becky--I'll whisper it, I'll whisper it ever so
easy.
Becky hesitating, Tom took silence for consent, and passed his arm about
her waist and whispered the tale ever so softly, with his mouth close to
her ear. And then he added:
Now you whisper it to me--just the same.
She resisted, for a while, and then said:
You turn your face away so you can't see, and then I will. But you
mustn't ever tell anybody--_will_ you, Tom? Now you won't, _will_ you?
No, indeed, indeed I won't. Now, Becky.
He turned his face away. She bent timidly around till her breath stirred
his curls and whispered, I--love--you!
Then she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and benches,
with Tom after her, and took refuge in a corner at last, with her little
white apron to her face. Tom clasped her about her neck and pleaded:
Now, Becky, it's all done--all over but the kiss. Don't you be afraid
of that--it ain't anything at all. Please, Becky. And he tugged at her
apron and the hands.
By and by she gave up, and let her hands drop; her face, all glowing
with the struggle, came up and submitted. Tom kissed the red lips and
said:
Now it's all done, Becky. And always after this, you know, you ain't
ever to love anybody but me, and you ain't ever to marry anybody but me,
ever never and forever. Will you?
No, I'll never love anybody but you, Tom, and I'll never marry anybody
but you--and you ain't to ever marry anybody but me, either.
Certainly. Of course. That's _part_ of it. And always coming to school
or when we're going home, you're to walk with me, when there ain't
anybody looking--and you choose me and I choose you at parties, because
that's the way you do when you're engaged.
It's so nice. I never heard of it before.
Oh, it's ever so gay! Why, me and Amy Lawrence--
The big eyes told Tom his blunder and he stopped, confused.
Oh, Tom! Then I ain't the first you've ever been engaged to!
The child began to cry. Tom said:
Oh, don't cry, Becky, I don't care for her any more.
Yes, you do, Tom--you know you do.
Tom tried to put his arm about her neck, but she pushed him away and
turned her face to the wall, and went on crying. Tom tried again, with
soothing words in his mouth, and was repulsed again. Then his pride was
up, and he strode away and went outside. He stood about, restless and
uneasy, for a while, glancing at the door, every now and then, hoping
she would repent and come to find him. But she did not. Then he began
to feel badly and fear that he was in the wrong. It was a hard struggle
with him to make new advances, now, but he nerved himself to it and
entered. She was still standing back there in the corner, sobbing, with
her face to the wall. Tom's heart smote him. He went to her and stood a
moment, not knowing exactly how to proceed. Then he said hesitatingly:
Becky, I--I don't care for anybody but you.
No reply--but sobs.
Becky--pleadingly. Becky, won't you say something?
More sobs.
Tom got out his chiefest jewel, a brass knob from the top of an andiron,
and passed it around her so that she could see it, and said:
Please, Becky, won't you take it?
She struck it to the floor. Then Tom marched out of the house and over
the hills and far away, to return to school no more that day. Presently
Becky began to suspect. She ran to the door; he was not in sight; she
flew around to the play-yard; he was not there. Then she called:
Tom! Come back, Tom!
She listened intently, but there was no answer. She had no companions
but silence and loneliness. So she sat down to cry again and upbraid
herself; and by this time the scholars began to gather again, and she
had to hide her griefs and still her broken heart and take up the cross
of a long, dreary, aching afternoon, with none among the strangers about
her to exchange sorrows with.
CHAPTER VIII
TOM dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was well out of the
track of returning scholars, and then fell into a moody jog. He crossed
a small branch two or three times, because of a prevailing juvenile
superstition that to cross water baffled pursuit. Half an hour later
he was disappearing behind the Douglas mansion on the summit of Cardiff
Hill, and the school-house was hardly distinguishable away off in the
valley behind him. He entered a dense wood, picked his pathless way to
the centre of it, and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading oak.
There was not even a zephyr stirring; the dead noonday heat had even
stilled the songs of the birds; nature lay in a trance that was broken
by no sound but the occasional far-off hammering of a wood-pecker, and
this seemed to render the pervading silence and sense of loneliness the
more profound. The boy's soul was steeped in melancholy; his feelings
were in happy accord with his surroundings. He sat long with his elbows
on his knees and his chin in his hands, meditating. It seemed to him
that life was but a trouble, at best, and he more than half envied Jimmy
Hodges, so lately released; it must be very peaceful, he thought, to lie
and slumber and dream forever and ever, with the wind whispering through
the trees and caressing the grass and the flowers over the grave, and
nothing to bother and grieve about, ever any more. If he only had a
clean Sunday-school record he could be willing to go, and be done with
it all. Now as to this girl. What had he done? Nothing. He had meant
the best in the world, and been treated like a dog--like a very dog. She
would be sorry some day--maybe when it was too late. Ah, if he could only
die _temporarily_!
But the elastic heart of youth cannot be compressed into one constrained
shape long at a time. Tom presently began to drift insensibly back into
the concerns of this life again. What if he turned his back, now, and
disappeared mysteriously? What if he went away--ever so far away, into
unknown countries beyond the seas--and never came back any more! How
would she feel then! The idea of being a clown recurred to him now, only
to fill him with disgust. For frivolity and jokes and spotted tights
were an offense, when they intruded themselves upon a spirit that was
exalted into the vague august realm of the romantic. No, he would be
a soldier, and return after long years, all war-worn and illustrious.
No--better still, he would join the Indians, and hunt buffaloes and go on
the warpath in the mountain ranges and the trackless great plains of the
Far West, and away in the future come back a great chief, bristling with
feathers, hideous with paint, and prance into Sunday-school, some drowsy
summer morning, with a blood-curdling war-whoop, and sear the eyeballs
of all his companions with unappeasable envy. But no, there was
something gaudier even than this. He would be a pirate! That was it!
_now_ his future lay plain before him, and glowing with unimaginable
splendor. How his name would fill the world, and make people shudder!
How gloriously he would go plowing the dancing seas, in his long, low,
black-hulled racer, the Spirit of the Storm, with his grisly flag flying
at the fore! And at the zenith of his fame, how he would suddenly appear
at the old village and stalk into church, brown and weather-beaten, in
his black velvet doublet and trunks, his great jack-boots, his crimson
sash, his belt bristling with horse-pistols, his crime-rusted cutlass
at his side, his slouch hat with waving plumes, his black flag unfurled,
with the skull and crossbones on it, and hear with swelling ecstasy
the whisperings, It's Tom Sawyer the Pirate!--the Black Avenger of the
Spanish Main!
Yes, it was settled; his career was determined. He would run away from
home and enter upon it. He would start the very next morning. Therefore
he must now begin to get ready. He would collect his resources together.
He went to a rotten log near at hand and began to dig under one end of
it with his Barlow knife. He soon struck wood that sounded hollow. He
put his hand there and uttered this incantation impressively:
What hasn't come here, come! What's here, stay here!
Then he scraped away the dirt, and exposed a pine shingle. He took it
up and disclosed a shapely little treasure-house whose bottom and sides
were of shingles. In it lay a marble. Tom's astonishment was bound-less!
He scratched his head with a perplexed air, and said:
Well, that beats anything!
Then he tossed the marble away pettishly, and stood cogitating. The
truth was, that a superstition of his had failed, here, which he and
all his comrades had always looked upon as infallible. If you buried
a marble with certain necessary incantations, and left it alone a
fortnight, and then opened the place with the incantation he had just
used, you would find that all the marbles you had ever lost had gathered
themselves together there, meantime, no matter how widely they had been
separated. But now, this thing had actually and unquestionably failed.
Tom's whole structure of faith was shaken to its foundations. He had
many a time heard of this thing succeeding but never of its failing
before. It did not occur to him that he had tried it several times
before, himself, but could never find the hiding-places afterward. He
puzzled over the matter some time, and finally decided that some witch
had interfered and broken the charm. He thought he would satisfy himself
on that point; so he searched around till he found a small sandy spot
with a little funnel-shaped depression in it. He laid himself down and
put his mouth close to this depression and called--
Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know! Doodle-bug,
doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know!
The sand began to work, and presently a small black bug appeared for a
second and then darted under again in a fright.
He dasn't tell! So it _was_ a witch that done it. I just knowed it.
He well knew the futility of trying to contend against witches, so he
gave up discouraged. But it occurred to him that he might as well have
the marble he had just thrown away, and therefore he went and made a
patient search for it. But he could not find it. Now he went back to his
treasure-house and carefully placed himself just as he had been standing
when he tossed the marble away; then he took another marble from his
pocket and tossed it in the same way, saying:
Brother, go find your brother!
He watched where it stopped, and went there and looked. But it must
have fallen short or gone too far; so he tried twice more. The last
repetition was successful. The two marbles lay within a foot of each
other.
Just here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the green
aisles of the forest. Tom flung off his jacket and trousers, turned
a suspender into a belt, raked away some brush behind the rotten log,
disclosing a rude bow and arrow, a lath sword and a tin trumpet, and
in a moment had seized these things and bounded away, barelegged,
with fluttering shirt. He presently halted under a great elm, blew an
answering blast, and then began to tiptoe and look warily out, this way
and that. He said cautiously--to an imaginary company:
Hold, my merry men! Keep hid till I blow.
Now appeared Joe Harper, as airily clad and elaborately armed as Tom.
Tom called:
Hold! Who comes here into Sherwood Forest without my pass?
Guy of Guisborne wants no man's pass. Who art thou that--that--
Dares to hold such language, said Tom, prompting--for they talked by
the book, from memory.
Who art thou that dares to hold such language?
I, indeed! I am Robin Hood, as thy caitiff carcase soon shall know.
Then art thou indeed that famous outlaw? Right gladly will I dispute
with thee the passes of the merry wood. Have at thee!
They took their lath swords, dumped their other traps on the ground,
struck a fencing attitude, foot to foot, and began a grave, careful
combat, two up and two down. Presently Tom said:
Now, if you've got the hang, go it lively!
So they went it lively, panting and perspiring with the work. By and
by Tom shouted:
Fall! fall! Why don't you fall?
I sha'n't! Why don't you fall yourself? You're getting the worst of
it.
Why, that ain't anything. I can't fall; that ain't the way it is in the
book. The book says, 'Then with one back-handed stroke he slew poor Guy
of Guisborne.' You're to turn around and let me hit you in the back.
There was no getting around the authorities, so Joe turned, received the
whack and fell.
Now, said Joe, getting up, you got to let me kill _you_. That's
fair.
Why, I can't do that, it ain't in the book.
Well, it's blamed mean--that's all.
Well, say, Joe, you can be Friar Tuck or Much the miller's son, and lam
me with a quarter-staff; or I'll be the Sheriff of Nottingham and you be
Robin Hood a little while and kill me.
This was satisfactory, and so these adventures were carried out. Then
Tom became Robin Hood again, and was allowed by the treacherous nun to
bleed his strength away through his neglected wound. And at last Joe,
representing a whole tribe of weeping outlaws, dragged him sadly forth,
gave his bow into his feeble hands, and Tom said, Where this arrow
falls, there bury poor Robin Hood under the greenwood tree. Then he
shot the arrow and fell back and would have died, but he lit on a nettle
and sprang up too gaily for a corpse.
The boys dressed themselves, hid their accoutrements, and went off
grieving that there were no outlaws any more, and wondering what modern
civilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss.
They said they would rather be outlaws a year in Sherwood Forest than
President of the United States forever.
CHAPTER IX
AT half-past nine, that night, Tom and Sid were sent to bed, as usual.
They said their prayers, and Sid was soon asleep. Tom lay awake and
waited, in restless impatience. When it seemed to him that it must be
nearly daylight, he heard the clock strike ten! This was despair. He
would have tossed and fidgeted, as his nerves demanded, but he was
afraid he might wake Sid. So he lay still, and stared up into the dark.
Everything was dismally still. By and by, out of the stillness, little,
scarcely perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves. The ticking
of the clock began to bring itself into notice. Old beams began to crack
mysteriously. The stairs creaked faintly. Evidently spirits were abroad.
A measured, muffled snore issued from Aunt Polly's chamber. And now the
tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could locate,
began. Next the ghastly ticking of a death-watch in the wall at the
bed's head made Tom shudder--it meant that somebody's days were numbered.
Then the howl of a far-off dog rose on the night air, and was answered
by a fainter howl from a remoter distance. Tom was in an agony. At last
he was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity begun; he began to
doze, in spite of himself; the clock chimed eleven, but he did not hear
it. And then there came, mingling with his half-formed dreams, a most
melancholy caterwauling. The raising of a neighboring window disturbed
him. A cry of Scat! you devil! and the crash of an empty bottle
against the back of his aunt's woodshed brought him wide awake, and a
single minute later he was dressed and out of the window and creeping
along the roof of the ell on all fours. He meow'd with caution once
or twice, as he went; then jumped to the roof of the woodshed and thence
to the ground. Huckleberry Finn was there, with his dead cat. The boys
moved off and disappeared in the gloom. At the end of half an hour they
were wading through the tall grass of the graveyard.
It was a graveyard of the old-fashioned Western kind. It was on a hill,
about a mile and a half from the village. It had a crazy board fence
around it, which leaned inward in places, and outward the rest of the
time, but stood upright nowhere. Grass and weeds grew rank over the
whole cemetery. All the old graves were sunken in, there was not a
tombstone on the place; round-topped, worm-eaten boards staggered over
the graves, leaning for support and finding none. Sacred to the memory
of So-and-So had been painted on them once, but it could no longer have
been read, on the most of them, now, even if there had been light.
A faint wind moaned through the trees, and Tom feared it might be the
spirits of the dead, complaining at being disturbed. The boys talked
little, and only under their breath, for the time and the place and the
pervading solemnity and silence oppressed their spirits. They found the
sharp new heap they were seeking, and ensconced themselves within the
protection of three great elms that grew in a bunch within a few feet of
the grave.
Then they waited in silence for what seemed a long time. The hooting of
a distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead stillness. Tom's
reflections grew oppressive. He must force some talk. So he said in a
whisper:
Hucky, do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here?
Huckleberry whispered:
I wisht I knowed. It's awful solemn like, _ain't_ it?
I bet it is.
There was a considerable pause, while the boys canvassed this matter
inwardly. Then Tom whispered:
Say, Hucky--do you reckon Hoss Williams hears us talking?
O' course he does. Least his sperrit does.
Tom, after a pause:
I wish I'd said Mister Williams. But I never meant any harm. Everybody
calls him Hoss.
A body can't be too partic'lar how they talk 'bout these-yer dead
people, Tom.
This was a damper, and conversation died again.
Presently Tom seized his comrade's arm and said:
Sh!
What is it, Tom? And the two clung together with beating hearts.
Sh! There 'tis again! Didn't you hear it?
I--
There! Now you hear it.
Lord, Tom, they're coming! They're coming, sure. What'll we do?
I dono. Think they'll see us?
Oh, Tom, they can see in the dark, same as cats. I wisht I hadn't
come.
Oh, don't be afeard. I don't believe they'll bother us. We ain't doing
any harm. If we keep perfectly still, maybe they won't notice us at
all.
I'll try to, Tom, but, Lord, I'm all of a shiver.
Listen!
The boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed. A muffled
sound of voices floated up from the far end of the graveyard.
Look! See there! whispered Tom. What is it?
It's devil-fire. Oh, Tom, this is awful.
Some vague figures approached through the gloom, swinging an
old-fashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable
little spangles of light. Presently Huckleberry whispered with a
shudder:
It's the devils sure enough. Three of 'em! Lordy, Tom, we're goners!
Can you pray?
I'll try, but don't you be afeard. They ain't going to hurt us. 'Now I
lay me down to sleep, I--'
Sh!
What is it, Huck?
They're _humans_! One of 'em is, anyway. One of 'em's old Muff Potter's
voice.
No--'tain't so, is it?
I bet I know it. Don't you stir nor budge. He ain't sharp enough to
notice us. Drunk, the same as usual, likely--blamed old rip!
All right, I'll keep still. Now they're stuck. Can't find it. Here they
come again. Now they're hot. Cold again. Hot again. Red hot! They're
p'inted right, this time. Say, Huck, I know another o' them voices; it's
Injun Joe.
That's so--that murderin' half-breed! I'd druther they was devils a dern
sight. What kin they be up to?
The whisper died wholly out, now, for the three men had reached the
grave and stood within a few feet of the boys' hiding-place.
Here it is, said the third voice; and the owner of it held the lantern
up and revealed the face of young Doctor Robinson.
Potter and Injun Joe were carrying a handbarrow with a rope and a couple
of shovels on it. They cast down their load and began to open the grave.
The doctor put the lantern at the head of the grave and came and sat
down with his back against one of the elm trees. He was so close the
boys could have touched him.
Hurry, men! he said, in a low voice; the moon might come out at any
moment.
They growled a response and went on digging. For some time there was no
noise but the grating sound of the spades discharging their freight of
mould and gravel. It was very monotonous. Finally a spade struck upon
the coffin with a dull woody accent, and within another minute or two
the men had hoisted it out on the ground. They pried off the lid with
their shovels, got out the body and dumped it rudely on the ground. The
moon drifted from behind the clouds and exposed the pallid face.
The barrow was got ready and the corpse placed on it, covered with a
blanket, and bound to its place with the rope. Potter took out a large
spring-knife and cut off the dangling end of the rope and then said:
Now the cussed thing's ready, Sawbones, and you'll just out with
another five, or here she stays.
That's the talk! said Injun Joe.
Look here, what does this mean? said the doctor. You required your
pay in advance, and I've paid you.
Yes, and you done more than that, said Injun Joe, approaching the
doctor, who was now standing. Five years ago you drove me away from
your father's kitchen one night, when I come to ask for something to
eat, and you said I warn't there for any good; and when I swore I'd get
even with you if it took a hundred years, your father had me jailed for
a vagrant. Did you think I'd forget? The Injun blood ain't in me for
nothing. And now I've _got_ you, and you got to _settle_, you know!
He was threatening the doctor, with his fist in his face, by this time.
The doctor struck out suddenly and stretched the ruffian on the ground.
Potter dropped his knife, and exclaimed:
Here, now, don't you hit my pard! and the next moment he had grappled
with the doctor and the two were struggling with might and main,
trampling the grass and tearing the ground with their heels. Injun Joe
sprang to his feet, his eyes flaming with passion, snatched up Potter's
knife, and went creeping, catlike and stooping, round and round about
the combatants, seeking an opportunity. All at once the doctor flung
himself free, seized the heavy headboard of Williams' grave and felled
Potter to the earth with it--and in the same instant the half-breed saw
his chance and drove the knife to the hilt in the young man's breast. He
reeled and fell partly upon Potter, flooding him with his blood, and in
the same moment the clouds blotted out the dreadful spectacle and the
two frightened boys went speeding away in the dark.
Presently, when the moon emerged again, Injun Joe was standing over the
two forms, contemplating them. The doctor murmured inarticulately, gave
a long gasp or two and was still. The half-breed muttered:
_That_ score is settled--damn you.
Then he robbed the body. After which he put the fatal knife in Potter's
open right hand, and sat down on the dismantled coffin. Three--four--five
minutes passed, and then Potter began to stir and moan. His hand closed
upon the knife; he raised it, glanced at it, and let it fall, with a
shudder. Then he sat up, pushing the body from him, and gazed at it, and
then around him, confusedly. His eyes met Joe's.
Lord, how is this, Joe? he said.
It's a dirty business, said Joe, without moving.
What did you do it for?
I! I never done it!
Look here! That kind of talk won't wash.
Potter trembled and grew white.
I thought I'd got sober. I'd no business to drink to-night. But it's
in my head yet--worse'n when we started here. I'm all in a muddle;
can't recollect anything of it, hardly. Tell me, Joe--_honest_, now,
old feller--did I do it? Joe, I never meant to--'pon my soul and honor, I
never meant to, Joe. Tell me how it was, Joe. Oh, it's awful--and him so
young and promising.
Why, you two was scuffling, and he fetched you one with the headboard
and you fell flat; and then up you come, all reeling and staggering
like, and snatched the knife and jammed it into him, just as he fetched
you another awful clip--and here you've laid, as dead as a wedge til
now.
Oh, I didn't know what I was a-doing. I wish I may die this minute if I
did. It was all on account of the whiskey and the excitement, I reckon.
I never used a weepon in my life before, Joe. I've fought, but never
with weepons. They'll all say that. Joe, don't tell! Say you won't tell,
Joe--that's a good feller. I always liked you, Joe, and stood up for you,
too. Don't you remember? You _won't_ tell, _will_ you, Joe? And the
poor creature dropped on his knees before the stolid murderer, and
clasped his appealing hands.
No, you've always been fair and square with me, Muff Potter, and I
won't go back on you. There, now, that's as fair as a man can say.
Oh, Joe, you're an angel. I'll bless you for this the longest day I
live. And Potter began to cry.
Come, now, that's enough of that. This ain't any time for blubbering.
You be off yonder way and I'll go this. Move, now, and don't leave any
tracks behind you.
Potter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run. The half-breed
stood looking after him. He muttered:
If he's as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as he
had the look of being, he won't think of the knife till he's gone so
far he'll be afraid to come back after it to such a place by
himself--chicken-heart!
Two or three minutes later the murdered man, the blanketed corpse, the
lidless coffin, and the open grave were under no inspection but the
moon's. The stillness was complete again, too.
CHAPTER X
THE two boys flew on and on, toward the village, speechless with
horror. They glanced backward over their shoulders from time to time,
apprehensively, as if they feared they might be followed. Every stump
that started up in their path seemed a man and an enemy, and made them
catch their breath; and as they sped by some outlying cottages that lay
near the village, the barking of the aroused watch-dogs seemed to give
wings to their feet.
If we can only get to the old tannery before we break down! whispered
Tom, in short catches between breaths. I can't stand it much longer.
Huckleberry's hard pantings were his only reply, and the boys fixed
their eyes on the goal of their hopes and bent to their work to win it.
They gained steadily on it, and at last, breast to breast, they burst
through the open door and fell grateful and exhausted in the sheltering
shadows beyond. By and by their pulses slowed down, and Tom whispered:
Huckleberry, what do you reckon'll come of this?
If Doctor Robinson dies, I reckon hanging'll come of it.
Do you though?
Why, I _know_ it, Tom.
Tom thought a while, then he said:
Who'll tell? We?
What are you talking about? S'pose something happened and Injun Joe
_didn't_ hang? Why, he'd kill us some time or other, just as dead sure
as we're a laying here.
That's just what I was thinking to myself, Huck.
If anybody tells, let Muff Potter do it, if he's fool enough. He's
generally drunk enough.
Tom said nothing--went on thinking. Presently he whispered:
Huck, Muff Potter don't know it. How can he tell?
What's the reason he don't know it?
Because he'd just got that whack when Injun Joe done it. D'you reckon
he could see anything? D'you reckon he knowed anything?
By hokey, that's so, Tom!
And besides, look-a-here--maybe that whack done for _him_!
No, 'taint likely, Tom. He had liquor in him; I could see that; and
besides, he always has. Well, when pap's full, you might take and belt
him over the head with a church and you couldn't phase him. He says so,
his own self. So it's the same with Muff Potter, of course. But if a man
was dead sober, I reckon maybe that whack might fetch him; I dono.
After another reflective silence, Tom said:
Hucky, you sure you can keep mum?
Tom, we _got_ to keep mum. You know that. That Injun devil wouldn't
make any more of drownding us than a couple of cats, if we was to squeak
'bout this and they didn't hang him. Now, look-a-here, Tom, less take
and swear to one another--that's what we got to do--swear to keep mum.
I'm agreed. It's the best thing. Would you just hold hands and swear
that we--
Oh no, that wouldn't do for this. That's good enough for little
rubbishy common things--specially with gals, cuz _they_ go back on you
anyway, and blab if they get in a huff--but there orter be writing 'bout
a big thing like this. And blood.
Tom's whole being applauded this idea. It was deep, and dark, and awful;
the hour, the circumstances, the surroundings, were in keeping with it.
He picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moon-light, took a
little fragment of red keel out of his pocket, got the moon on
his work, and painfully scrawled these lines, emphasizing each slow
down-stroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth, and letting up the
pressure on the up-strokes. [See next page.]
Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer swears they will keep mum about This and They
wish They may Drop down dead in Their Tracks if They ever Tell and Rot.
Huckleberry was filled with admiration of Tom's facility in writing, and
the sublimity of his language. He at once took a pin from his lapel and
was going to prick his flesh, but Tom said:
Hold on! Don't do that. A pin's brass. It might have verdigrease on
it.
What's verdigrease?
It's p'ison. That's what it is. You just swaller some of it once--you'll
see.
So Tom unwound the thread from one of his needles, and each boy pricked
the ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood. In time, after
many squeezes, Tom managed to sign his initials, using the ball of his
little finger for a pen. Then he showed Huckleberry how to make an H and
an F, and the oath was complete. They buried the shingle close to the
wall, with some dismal ceremonies and incantations, and the fetters
that bound their tongues were considered to be locked and the key thrown
away.
A figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the ruined
building, now, but they did not notice it.
Tom, whispered Huckleberry, does this keep us from _ever_
telling--_always_?
Of course it does. It don't make any difference _what_ happens, we got
to keep mum. We'd drop down dead--don't _you_ know that?
Yes, I reckon that's so.
They continued to whisper for some little time. Presently a dog set up
a long, lugubrious howl just outside--within ten feet of them. The boys
clasped each other suddenly, in an agony of fright.
Which of us does he mean? gasped Huckleberry.
I dono--peep through the crack. Quick!
No, _you_, Tom!
I can't--I can't _do_ it, Huck!
Please, Tom. There 'tis again!
Oh, lordy, I'm thankful! whispered Tom. I know his voice. It's Bull
Harbison. *
[* If Mr. Harbison owned a slave named Bull, Tom would have spoken of
him as Harbison's Bull, but a son or a dog of that name was Bull
Harbison.]
Oh, that's good--I tell you, Tom, I was most scared to death; I'd a bet
anything it was a _stray_ dog.
The dog howled again. The boys' hearts sank once more.
Oh, my! that ain't no Bull Harbison! whispered Huckleberry. _Do_,
Tom!
Tom, quaking with fear, yielded, and put his eye to the crack. His
whisper was hardly audible when he said:
Oh, Huck, _its a stray dog_!
Quick, Tom, quick! Who does he mean?
Huck, he must mean us both--we're right together.
Oh, Tom, I reckon we're goners. I reckon there ain't no mistake 'bout
where _I'll_ go to. I been so wicked.
Dad fetch it! This comes of playing hookey and doing everything a
feller's told _not_ to do. I might a been good, like Sid, if I'd a
tried--but no, I wouldn't, of course. But if ever I get off this time,
I lay I'll just _waller_ in Sunday-schools! And Tom began to snuffle a
little.
_You_ bad! and Huckleberry began to snuffle too. Consound it, Tom
Sawyer, you're just old pie, 'long-side o' what I am. Oh, _lordy_,
lordy, lordy, I wisht I only had half your chance.
Tom choked off and whispered:
Look, Hucky, look! He's got his _back_ to us!
Hucky looked, with joy in his heart.
Well, he has, by jingoes! Did he before?
Yes, he did. But I, like a fool, never thought. Oh, this is bully, you
know. _Now_ who can he mean?
The howling stopped. Tom pricked up his ears.
Sh! What's that? he whispered.
Sounds like--like hogs grunting. No--it's somebody snoring, Tom.
That _is_ it! Where 'bouts is it, Huck?
I bleeve it's down at 'tother end. Sounds so, anyway. Pap used to sleep
there, sometimes, 'long with the hogs, but laws bless you, he just lifts
things when _he_ snores. Besides, I reckon he ain't ever coming back to
this town any more.
The spirit of adventure rose in the boys' souls once more.
Hucky, do you das't to go if I lead?
I don't like to, much. Tom, s'pose it's Injun Joe!
Tom quailed. But presently the temptation rose up strong again and the
boys agreed to try, with the understanding that they would take to their
heels if the snoring stopped. So they went tiptoeing stealthily down,
the one behind the other. When they had got to within five steps of the
snorer, Tom stepped on a stick, and it broke with a sharp snap. The man
moaned, writhed a little, and his face came into the moonlight. It was
Muff Potter. The boys' hearts had stood still, and their hopes too,
when the man moved, but their fears passed away now. They tip-toed out,
through the broken weather-boarding, and stopped at a little distance
to exchange a parting word. That long, lugubrious howl rose on the night
air again! They turned and saw the strange dog standing within a few
feet of where Potter was lying, and _facing_ Potter, with his nose
pointing heavenward.
Oh, geeminy, it's _him_! exclaimed both boys, in a breath.
Say, Tom--they say a stray dog come howling around Johnny Miller's
house, 'bout midnight, as much as two weeks ago; and a whippoorwill come
in and lit on the banisters and sung, the very same evening; and there
ain't anybody dead there yet.
Well, I know that. And suppose there ain't. Didn't Gracie Miller fall
in the kitchen fire and burn herself terrible the very next Saturday?
Yes, but she ain't _dead_. And what's more, she's getting better, too.
All right, you wait and see. She's a goner, just as dead sure as Muff
Potter's a goner. That's what the niggers say, and they know all about
these kind of things, Huck.
Then they separated, cogitating. When Tom crept in at his bedroom window
the night was almost spent. He undressed with excessive caution, and
fell asleep congratulating himself that nobody knew of his escapade. He
was not aware that the gently-snoring Sid was awake, and had been so for
an hour.
When Tom awoke, Sid was dressed and gone. There was a late look in the
light, a late sense in the atmosphere. He was startled. Why had he not
been called--persecuted till he was up, as usual? The thought filled
him with bodings. Within five minutes he was dressed and down-stairs,
feeling sore and drowsy. The family were still at table, but they had
finished breakfast. There was no voice of rebuke; but there were averted
eyes; there was a silence and an air of solemnity that struck a chill
to the culprit's heart. He sat down and tried to seem gay, but it
was up-hill work; it roused no smile, no response, and he lapsed into
silence and let his heart sink down to the depths.
After breakfast his aunt took him aside, and Tom almost brightened in
the hope that he was going to be flogged; but it was not so. His aunt
wept over him and asked him how he could go and break her old heart so;
and finally told him to go on, and ruin himself and bring her gray hairs
with sorrow to the grave, for it was no use for her to try any more.
This was worse than a thousand whippings, and Tom's heart was sorer now
than his body. He cried, he pleaded for forgiveness, promised to reform
over and over again, and then received his dismissal, feeling that
he had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a feeble
confidence.
He left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful toward
Sid; and so the latter's prompt retreat through the back gate was
unnecessary. He moped to school gloomy and sad, and took his flogging,
along with Joe Harper, for playing hookey the day before, with the
air of one whose heart was busy with heavier woes and wholly dead to
trifles. Then he betook himself to his seat, rested his elbows on his
desk and his jaws in his hands, and stared at the wall with the stony
stare of suffering that has reached the limit and can no further go.
His elbow was pressing against some hard substance. After a long time
he slowly and sadly changed his position, and took up this object with
a sigh. It was in a paper. He unrolled it. A long, lingering, colossal
sigh followed, and his heart broke. It was his brass andiron knob!
This final feather broke the camel's back.
CHAPTER XI
CLOSE upon the hour of noon the whole village was suddenly electrified
with the ghastly news. No need of the as yet un-dreamed-of telegraph;
the tale flew from man to man, from group to group, from house to house,
with little less than telegraphic speed. Of course the schoolmaster gave
holi-day for that afternoon; the town would have thought strangely of
him if he had not.
A gory knife had been found close to the murdered man, and it had been
recognized by somebody as belonging to Muff Potter--so the story ran. And
it was said that a belated citizen had come upon Potter washing himself
in the branch about one or two o'clock in the morning, and that Potter
had at once sneaked off--suspicious circumstances, especially the washing
which was not a habit with Potter. It was also said that the town had
been ransacked for this murderer (the public are not slow in the
matter of sifting evidence and arriving at a verdict), but that he
could not be found. Horsemen had departed down all the roads in every
direction, and the Sheriff was confident that he would be captured
before night.
All the town was drifting toward the graveyard. Tom's heartbreak
vanished and he joined the procession, not because he would not
a thousand times rather go anywhere else, but because an awful,
unaccountable fascination drew him on. Arrived at the dreadful place, he
wormed his small body through the crowd and saw the dismal spectacle.
It seemed to him an age since he was there before. Somebody pinched
his arm. He turned, and his eyes met Huckleberry's. Then both looked
elsewhere at once, and wondered if anybody had noticed anything in their
mutual glance. But everybody was talking, and intent upon the grisly
spectacle before them.
Poor fellow! Poor young fellow! This ought to be a lesson to grave
robbers! Muff Potter'll hang for this if they catch him! This was the
drift of remark; and the minister said, It was a judgment; His hand is
here.
Now Tom shivered from head to heel; for his eye fell upon the stolid
face of Injun Joe. At this moment the crowd began to sway and struggle,
and voices shouted, It's him! it's him! he's coming himself!
Who? Who? from twenty voices.
Muff Potter!
Hallo, he's stopped!--Look out, he's turning! Don't let him get away!
People in the branches of the trees over Tom's head said he wasn't
trying to get away--he only looked doubtful and perplexed.
Infernal impudence! said a bystander; wanted to come and take a quiet
look at his work, I reckon--didn't expect any company.
The crowd fell apart, now, and the Sheriff came through, ostentatiously
leading Potter by the arm. The poor fellow's face was haggard, and
his eyes showed the fear that was upon him. When he stood before the
murdered man, he shook as with a palsy, and he put his face in his hands
and burst into tears.
I didn't do it, friends, he sobbed; 'pon my word and honor I never
done it.
Who's accused you? shouted a voice.
This shot seemed to carry home. Potter lifted his face and looked around
him with a pathetic hopelessness in his eyes. He saw Injun Joe, and
exclaimed:
Oh, Injun Joe, you promised me you'd never--
Is that your knife? and it was thrust before him by the Sheriff.
Potter would have fallen if they had not caught him and eased him to the
ground. Then he said:
Something told me 't if I didn't come back and get-- He shuddered; then
waved his nerveless hand with a vanquished gesture and said, Tell 'em,
Joe, tell 'em--it ain't any use any more.
Then Huckleberry and Tom stood dumb and staring, and heard the
stony-hearted liar reel off his serene statement, they expecting every
moment that the clear sky would deliver God's lightnings upon his head,
and wondering to see how long the stroke was delayed. And when he had
finished and still stood alive and whole, their wavering impulse to
break their oath and save the poor betrayed prisoner's life faded and
vanished away, for plainly this miscreant had sold himself to Satan and
it would be fatal to meddle with the property of such a power as that.
Why didn't you leave? What did you want to come here for? somebody
said.
I couldn't help it--I couldn't help it, Potter moaned. I wanted to
run away, but I couldn't seem to come anywhere but here. And he fell to
sobbing again.
Injun Joe repeated his statement, just as calmly, a few minutes
afterward on the inquest, under oath; and the boys, seeing that the
lightnings were still withheld, were confirmed in their belief that
Joe had sold himself to the devil. He was now become, to them, the most
balefully interesting object they had ever looked upon, and they could
not take their fascinated eyes from his face.
They inwardly resolved to watch him nights, when opportunity should
offer, in the hope of getting a glimpse of his dread master.
Injun Joe helped to raise the body of the murdered man and put it in
a wagon for removal; and it was whispered through the shuddering
crowd that the wound bled a little! The boys thought that this happy
circumstance would turn suspicion in the right direction; but they were
disappointed, for more than one villager remarked:
It was within three feet of Muff Potter when it done it.
Tom's fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep for as
much as a week after this; and at breakfast one morning Sid said:
Tom, you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you keep me
awake half the time.
Tom blanched and dropped his eyes.
It's a bad sign, said Aunt Polly, gravely. What you got on your mind,
Tom?
Nothing. Nothing 't I know of. But the boy's hand shook so that he
spilled his coffee.
And you do talk such stuff, Sid said. Last night you said, 'It's
blood, it's blood, that's what it is!' You said that over and over.
And you said, 'Don't torment me so--I'll tell!' Tell _what_? What is it
you'll tell?
Everything was swimming before Tom. There is no telling what might have
happened, now, but luckily the concern passed out of Aunt Polly's face
and she came to Tom's relief without knowing it. She said:
Sho! It's that dreadful murder. I dream about it most every night
myself. Sometimes I dream it's me that done it.
Mary said she had been affected much the same way. Sid seemed satisfied.
Tom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly could, and after
that he complained of toothache for a week, and tied up his jaws every
night. He never knew that Sid lay nightly watching, and frequently
slipped the bandage free and then leaned on his elbow listening a good
while at a time, and afterward slipped the bandage back to its place
again. Tom's distress of mind wore off gradually and the toothache grew
irksome and was discarded. If Sid really managed to make anything out of
Tom's disjointed mutterings, he kept it to himself.
It seemed to Tom that his schoolmates never would get done holding
inquests on dead cats, and thus keeping his trouble present to his mind.
Sid noticed that Tom never was coroner at one of these inquiries,
though it had been his habit to take the lead in all new enterprises;
he noticed, too, that Tom never acted as a witness--and that was strange;
and Sid did not overlook the fact that Tom even showed a marked aversion
to these inquests, and always avoided them when he could. Sid marvelled,
but said nothing. However, even inquests went out of vogue at last, and
ceased to torture Tom's conscience.
Every day or two, during this time of sorrow, Tom watched his
opportunity and went to the little grated jail-window and smuggled such
small comforts through to the murderer as he could get hold of. The
jail was a trifling little brick den that stood in a marsh at the edge
of the village, and no guards were afforded for it; indeed, it
was seldom occupied. These offerings greatly helped to ease Tom's
conscience.
The villagers had a strong desire to tar-and-feather Injun Joe and ride
him on a rail, for body-snatching, but so formidable was his character
that nobody could be found who was willing to take the lead in the
matter, so it was dropped. He had been careful to begin both of his
inquest-statements with the fight, without confessing the grave-robbery
that preceded it; therefore it was deemed wisest not to try the case in
the courts at present.
CHAPTER XII
ONE of the reasons why Tom's mind had drifted away from its secret
troubles was, that it had found a new and weighty matter to interest
itself about. Becky Thatcher had stopped coming to school. Tom had
struggled with his pride a few days, and tried to whistle her down the
wind, but failed. He began to find himself hanging around her father's
house, nights, and feeling very miserable. She was ill. What if she
should die! There was distraction in the thought. He no longer took an
interest in war, nor even in piracy. The charm of life was gone; there
was nothing but dreariness left. He put his hoop away, and his bat;
there was no joy in them any more. His aunt was concerned. She began to
try all manner of remedies on him. She was one of those people who
are infatuated with patent medicines and all new-fangled methods of
producing health or mending it. She was an inveterate experimenter in
these things. When something fresh in this line came out she was in a
fever, right away, to try it; not on herself, for she was never ailing,
but on anybody else that came handy. She was a subscriber for all the
Health periodicals and phrenological frauds; and the solemn ignorance
they were inflated with was breath to her nostrils. All the rot they
contained about ventilation, and how to go to bed, and how to get up,
and what to eat, and what to drink, and how much exercise to take, and
what frame of mind to keep one's self in, and what sort of clothing
to wear, was all gospel to her, and she never observed that her
health-journals of the current month customarily upset everything they
had recommended the month before. She was as simple-hearted and honest
as the day was long, and so she was an easy victim. She gathered
together her quack periodicals and her quack medicines, and thus armed
with death, went about on her pale horse, metaphorically speaking, with
hell following after. But she never suspected that she was not an
angel of healing and the balm of Gilead in disguise, to the suffering
neighbors.
The water treatment was new, now, and Tom's low condition was a windfall
to her. She had him out at daylight every morning, stood him up in the
wood-shed and drowned him with a deluge of cold water; then she scrubbed
him down with a towel like a file, and so brought him to; then she
rolled him up in a wet sheet and put him away under blankets till she
sweated his soul clean and the yellow stains of it came through his
pores--as Tom said.
Yet notwithstanding all this, the boy grew more and more melancholy and
pale and dejected. She added hot baths, sitz baths, shower baths, and
plunges. The boy remained as dismal as a hearse. She began to assist the
water with a slim oatmeal diet and blister-plasters. She calculated his
capacity as she would a jug's, and filled him up every day with quack
cure-alls.
Tom had become indifferent to persecution by this time. This phase
filled the old lady's heart with consternation. This indifference must
be broken up at any cost. Now she heard of Pain-killer for the first
time. She ordered a lot at once. She tasted it and was filled with
gratitude. It was simply fire in a liquid form. She dropped the water
treatment and everything else, and pinned her faith to Pain-killer.
She gave Tom a teaspoonful and watched with the deepest anxiety for the
result. Her troubles were instantly at rest, her soul at peace again;
for the indifference was broken up. The boy could not have shown a
wilder, heartier interest, if she had built a fire under him.
Tom felt that it was time to wake up; this sort of life might be
romantic enough, in his blighted condition, but it was getting to have
too little sentiment and too much distracting variety about it. So he
thought over various plans for relief, and finally hit upon that of
professing to be fond of Pain-killer. He asked for it so often that he
became a nuisance, and his aunt ended by telling him to help himself and
quit bothering her. If it had been Sid, she would have had no misgivings
to alloy her delight; but since it was Tom, she watched the bottle
clandestinely. She found that the medicine did really diminish, but it
did not occur to her that the boy was mending the health of a crack in
the sitting-room floor with it.
One day Tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his aunt's yellow
cat came along, purring, eyeing the teaspoon avariciously, and begging
for a taste. Tom said:
Don't ask for it unless you want it, Peter.
But Peter signified that he did want it.
You better make sure.
Peter was sure.
Now you've asked for it, and I'll give it to you, because there ain't
anything mean about me; but if you find you don't like it, you mustn't
blame anybody but your own self.
Peter was agreeable. So Tom pried his mouth open and poured down
the Pain-killer. Peter sprang a couple of yards in the air, and then
delivered a war-whoop and set off round and round the room, banging
against furniture, upsetting flower-pots, and making general havoc. Next
he rose on his hind feet and pranced around, in a frenzy of enjoyment,
with his head over his shoulder and his voice proclaiming his
unappeasable happiness. Then he went tearing around the house again
spreading chaos and destruction in his path. Aunt Polly entered in time
to see him throw a few double summersets, deliver a final mighty hurrah,
and sail through the open window, carrying the rest of the flower-pots
with him. The old lady stood petrified with astonishment, peering over
her glasses; Tom lay on the floor expiring with laughter.
Tom, what on earth ails that cat?
I don't know, aunt, gasped the boy.
Why, I never see anything like it. What did make him act so?
Deed I don't know, Aunt Polly; cats always act so when they're having a
good time.
They do, do they? There was something in the tone that made Tom
apprehensive.
Yes'm. That is, I believe they do.
You _do_?
Yes'm.
The old lady was bending down, Tom watching, with interest emphasized
by anxiety. Too late he divined her drift. The handle of the telltale
tea-spoon was visible under the bed-valance. Aunt Polly took it, held it
up. Tom winced, and dropped his eyes. Aunt Polly raised him by the usual
handle--his ear--and cracked his head soundly with her thimble.
Now, sir, what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so, for?
I done it out of pity for him--because he hadn't any aunt.
Hadn't any aunt!--you numskull. What has that got to do with it?
Heaps. Because if he'd had one she'd a burnt him out herself! She'd a
roasted his bowels out of him 'thout any more feeling than if he was a
human!
Aunt Polly felt a sudden pang of remorse. This was putting the thing in
a new light; what was cruelty to a cat _might_ be cruelty to a boy, too.
She began to soften; she felt sorry. Her eyes watered a little, and she
put her hand on Tom's head and said gently:
I was meaning for the best, Tom. And, Tom, it _did_ do you good.
Tom looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle peeping
through his gravity.
I know you was meaning for the best, aunty, and so was I with Peter. It
done _him_ good, too. I never see him get around so since--
Oh, go 'long with you, Tom, before you aggravate me again. And you try
and see if you can't be a good boy, for once, and you needn't take any
more medicine.
Tom reached school ahead of time. It was noticed that this strange thing
had been occurring every day latterly. And now, as usual of late,
he hung about the gate of the schoolyard instead of playing with his
comrades. He was sick, he said, and he looked it. He tried to seem to
be looking everywhere but whither he really was looking--down the road.
Presently Jeff Thatcher hove in sight, and Tom's face lighted; he gazed
a moment, and then turned sorrowfully away. When Jeff arrived, Tom
accosted him; and led up warily to opportunities for remark about
Becky, but the giddy lad never could see the bait. Tom watched and
watched, hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight, and hating the
owner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right one. At last frocks
ceased to appear, and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps; he entered
the empty schoolhouse and sat down to suffer. Then one more frock passed
in at the gate, and Tom's heart gave a great bound. The next instant he
was out, and going on like an Indian; yelling, laughing, chasing boys,
jumping over the fence at risk of life and limb, throwing handsprings,
standing on his head--doing all the heroic things he could conceive of,
and keeping a furtive eye out, all the while, to see if Becky Thatcher
was noticing. But she seemed to be unconscious of it all; she never
looked. Could it be possible that she was not aware that he was there?
He carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity; came war-whooping
around, snatched a boy's cap, hurled it to the roof of the schoolhouse,
broke through a group of boys, tumbling them in every direction, and
fell sprawling, himself, under Becky's nose, almost upsetting her--and
she turned, with her nose in the air, and he heard her say: Mf! some
people think they're mighty smart--always showing off!
Tom's cheeks burned. He gathered himself up and sneaked off, crushed and
crestfallen.
CHAPTER XIII
TOM'S mind was made up now. He was gloomy and desperate. He was a
forsaken, friendless boy, he said; nobody loved him; when they found out
what they had driven him to, perhaps they would be sorry; he had tried
to do right and get along, but they would not let him; since nothing
would do them but to be rid of him, let it be so; and let them blame
_him_ for the consequences--why shouldn't they? What right had the
friendless to complain? Yes, they had forced him to it at last: he would
lead a life of crime. There was no choice.
By this time he was far down Meadow Lane, and the bell for school to
take up tinkled faintly upon his ear. He sobbed, now, to think he
should never, never hear that old familiar sound any more--it was very
hard, but it was forced on him; since he was driven out into the cold
world, he must submit--but he forgave them. Then the sobs came thick and
fast.
Just at this point he met his soul's sworn comrade, Joe
Harper--hard-eyed, and with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his
heart. Plainly here were two souls with but a single thought. Tom,
wiping his eyes with his sleeve, began to blubber out something about
a resolution to escape from hard usage and lack of sympathy at home by
roaming abroad into the great world never to return; and ended by hoping
that Joe would not forget him.
But it transpired that this was a request which Joe had just been going
to make of Tom, and had come to hunt him up for that purpose. His mother
had whipped him for drinking some cream which he had never tasted and
knew nothing about; it was plain that she was tired of him and wished
him to go; if she felt that way, there was nothing for him to do but
succumb; he hoped she would be happy, and never regret having driven her
poor boy out into the unfeeling world to suffer and die.
As the two boys walked sorrowing along, they made a new compact to stand
by each other and be brothers and never separate till death relieved
them of their troubles. Then they began to lay their plans. Joe was for
being a hermit, and living on crusts in a remote cave, and dying,
some time, of cold and want and grief; but after listening to Tom, he
conceded that there were some conspicuous advantages about a life of
crime, and so he consented to be a pirate.
Three miles below St. Petersburg, at a point where the Mississippi River
was a trifle over a mile wide, there was a long, narrow, wooded island,
with a shallow bar at the head of it, and this offered well as a
rendezvous. It was not inhabited; it lay far over toward the further
shore, abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest. So Jackson's
Island was chosen. Who were to be the subjects of their piracies was a
matter that did not occur to them. Then they hunted up Huckleberry Finn,
and he joined them promptly, for all careers were one to him; he was
indifferent. They presently separated to meet at a lonely spot on the
river-bank two miles above the village at the favorite hour--which was
midnight. There was a small log raft there which they meant to capture.
Each would bring hooks and lines, and such provision as he could steal
in the most dark and mysterious way--as became outlaws. And before the
afternoon was done, they had all managed to enjoy the sweet glory of
spreading the fact that pretty soon the town would hear something. All
who got this vague hint were cautioned to be mum and wait.
About midnight Tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles,
and stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the
meeting-place. It was starlight, and very still. The mighty river lay
like an ocean at rest. Tom listened a moment, but no sound disturbed the
quiet. Then he gave a low, distinct whistle. It was answered from under
the bluff. Tom whistled twice more; these signals were answered in the
same way. Then a guarded voice said:
Who goes there?
Tom Sawyer, the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main. Name your names.
Huck Finn the Red-Handed, and Joe Harper the Terror of the Seas. Tom
had furnished these titles, from his favorite literature.
'Tis well. Give the countersign.
Two hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to the
brooding night:
_Blood_!
Then Tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after it,
tearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort. There was
an easy, comfortable path along the shore under the bluff, but it lacked
the advantages of difficulty and danger so valued by a pirate.
The Terror of the Seas had brought a side of bacon, and had about worn
himself out with getting it there. Finn the Red-Handed had stolen a
skillet and a quantity of half-cured leaf tobacco, and had also brought
a few corn-cobs to make pipes with. But none of the pirates smoked or
chewed but himself. The Black Avenger of the Spanish Main said it
would never do to start without some fire. That was a wise thought;
matches were hardly known there in that day. They saw a fire smouldering
upon a great raft a hundred yards above, and they went stealthily
thither and helped themselves to a chunk. They made an imposing
adventure of it, saying, Hist! every now and then, and suddenly
halting with finger on lip; moving with hands on imaginary dagger-hilts;
and giving orders in dismal whispers that if the foe stirred, to let
him have it to the hilt, because dead men tell no tales. They knew
well enough that the raftsmen were all down at the village laying
in stores or having a spree, but still that was no excuse for their
conducting this thing in an unpiratical way.
They shoved off, presently, Tom in command, Huck at the after oar and
Joe at the forward. Tom stood amidships, gloomy-browed, and with folded
arms, and gave his orders in a low, stern whisper:
Luff, and bring her to the wind!
Aye-aye, sir!
Steady, steady-y-y-y!
Steady it is, sir!
Let her go off a point!
Point it is, sir!
As the boys steadily and monotonously drove the raft toward mid-stream
it was no doubt understood that these orders were given only for
style, and were not intended to mean anything in particular.
What sail's she carrying?
Courses, tops'ls, and flying-jib, sir.
Send the r'yals up! Lay out aloft, there, half a dozen of
ye--foretopmaststuns'l! Lively, now!
Aye-aye, sir!
Shake out that maintogalans'l! Sheets and braces! _now_ my hearties!
Aye-aye, sir!
Hellum-a-lee--hard a port! Stand by to meet her when she comes! Port,
port! _Now_, men! With a will! Stead-y-y-y!
Steady it is, sir!
The raft drew beyond the middle of the river; the boys pointed her head
right, and then lay on their oars. The river was not high, so there was
not more than a two or three mile current. Hardly a word was said during
the next three-quarters of an hour. Now the raft was passing before
the distant town. Two or three glimmering lights showed where it lay,
peacefully sleeping, beyond the vague vast sweep of star-gemmed water,
unconscious of the tremendous event that was happening. The Black
Avenger stood still with folded arms, looking his last upon the scene
of his former joys and his later sufferings, and wishing she could see
him now, abroad on the wild sea, facing peril and death with dauntless
heart, going to his doom with a grim smile on his lips. It was but
a small strain on his imagination to remove Jackson's Island beyond
eye-shot of the village, and so he looked his last with a broken and
satisfied heart. The other pirates were looking their last, too; and
they all looked so long that they came near letting the current drift
them out of the range of the island. But they discovered the danger in
time, and made shift to avert it. About two o'clock in the morning the
raft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the head of the island,
and they waded back and forth until they had landed their freight. Part
of the little raft's belongings consisted of an old sail, and this they
spread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to shelter their provisions;
but they themselves would sleep in the open air in good weather, as
became outlaws.
They built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or thirty steps
within the sombre depths of the forest, and then cooked some bacon in
the frying-pan for supper, and used up half of the corn pone stock
they had brought. It seemed glorious sport to be feasting in that wild,
free way in the virgin forest of an unexplored and uninhabited island,
far from the haunts of men, and they said they never would return to
civilization. The climbing fire lit up their faces and threw its ruddy
glare upon the pillared tree-trunks of their forest temple, and upon the
varnished foliage and festooning vines.
When the last crisp slice of bacon was gone, and the last allowance
of corn pone devoured, the boys stretched themselves out on the grass,
filled with contentment. They could have found a cooler place, but
they would not deny themselves such a romantic feature as the roasting
campfire.
_Ain't_ it gay? said Joe.
It's _nuts_! said Tom. What would the boys say if they could see us?
Say? Well, they'd just die to be here--hey, Hucky!
I reckon so, said Huckleberry; anyways, I'm suited. I don't want
nothing better'n this. I don't ever get enough to eat, gen'ally--and here
they can't come and pick at a feller and bullyrag him so.
It's just the life for me, said Tom. You don't have to get up,
mornings, and you don't have to go to school, and wash, and all that
blame foolishness. You see a pirate don't have to do _anything_, Joe,
when he's ashore, but a hermit _he_ has to be praying considerable, and
then he don't have any fun, anyway, all by himself that way.
Oh yes, that's so, said Joe, but I hadn't thought much about it, you
know. I'd a good deal rather be a pirate, now that I've tried it.
You see, said Tom, people don't go much on hermits, nowadays, like
they used to in old times, but a pirate's always respected. And
a hermit's got to sleep on the hardest place he can find, and put
sackcloth and ashes on his head, and stand out in the rain, and--
What does he put sackcloth and ashes on his head for? inquired Huck.
I dono. But they've _got_ to do it. Hermits always do. You'd have to do
that if you was a hermit.
Dern'd if I would, said Huck.
Well, what would you do?
I dono. But I wouldn't do that.
Why, Huck, you'd _have_ to. How'd you get around it?
Why, I just wouldn't stand it. I'd run away.
Run away! Well, you _would_ be a nice old slouch of a hermit. You'd be
a disgrace.
The Red-Handed made no response, being better employed. He had finished
gouging out a cob, and now he fitted a weed stem to it, loaded it with
tobacco, and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a cloud of
fragrant smoke--he was in the full bloom of luxurious contentment. The
other pirates envied him this majestic vice, and secretly resolved to
acquire it shortly. Presently Huck said:
What does pirates have to do?
Tom said:
Oh, they have just a bully time--take ships and burn them, and get the
money and bury it in awful places in their island where there's ghosts
and things to watch it, and kill everybody in the ships--make 'em walk a
plank.
And they carry the women to the island, said Joe; they don't kill the
women.
No, assented Tom, they don't kill the women--they're too noble. And
the women's always beautiful, too.
And don't they wear the bulliest clothes! Oh no! All gold and silver
and di'monds, said Joe, with enthusiasm.
Who? said Huck.
Why, the pirates.
Huck scanned his own clothing forlornly.
I reckon I ain't dressed fitten for a pirate, said he, with a
regretful pathos in his voice; but I ain't got none but these.
But the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast enough,
after they should have begun their adventures. They made him understand
that his poor rags would do to begin with, though it was customary for
wealthy pirates to start with a proper wardrobe.
Gradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the
eyelids of the little waifs. The pipe dropped from the fingers of the
Red-Handed, and he slept the sleep of the conscience-free and the weary.
The Terror of the Seas and the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main had
more difficulty in getting to sleep. They said their prayers inwardly,
and lying down, since there was nobody there with authority to make them
kneel and recite aloud; in truth, they had a mind not to say them at
all, but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as that, lest they
might call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from heaven. Then at
once they reached and hovered upon the imminent verge of sleep--but an
intruder came, now, that would not down. It was conscience. They began
to feel a vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away; and
next they thought of the stolen meat, and then the real torture came.
They tried to argue it away by reminding conscience that they had
purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of times; but conscience was not
to be appeased by such thin plausibilities; it seemed to them, in the
end, that there was no getting around the stubborn fact that taking
sweetmeats was only hooking, while taking bacon and hams and such
valuables was plain simple stealing--and there was a command against that
in the Bible. So they inwardly resolved that so long as they remained in
the business, their piracies should not again be sullied with the
crime of stealing. Then conscience granted a truce, and these curiously
inconsistent pirates fell peacefully to sleep.
CHAPTER XIV
WHEN Tom awoke in the morning, he wondered where he was. He sat up and
rubbed his eyes and looked around. Then he comprehended. It was the cool
gray dawn, and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in the
deep pervading calm and silence of the woods. Not a leaf stirred; not
a sound obtruded upon great Nature's meditation. Beaded dewdrops stood
upon the leaves and grasses. A white layer of ashes covered the fire,
and a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air. Joe and Huck
still slept.
Now, far away in the woods a bird called; another answered; presently
the hammering of a woodpecker was heard. Gradually the cool dim gray
of the morning whitened, and as gradually sounds multiplied and life
manifested itself. The marvel of Nature shaking off sleep and going
to work unfolded itself to the musing boy. A little green worm came
crawling over a dewy leaf, lifting two-thirds of his body into the air
from time to time and sniffing around, then proceeding again--for he
was measuring, Tom said; and when the worm approached him, of its own
accord, he sat as still as a stone, with his hopes rising and falling,
by turns, as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to
go elsewhere; and when at last it considered a painful moment with its
curved body in the air and then came decisively down upon Tom's leg and
began a journey over him, his whole heart was glad--for that meant that
he was going to have a new suit of clothes--without the shadow of a
doubt a gaudy piratical uniform. Now a procession of ants appeared,
from nowhere in particular, and went about their labors; one struggled
manfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms,
and lugged it straight up a tree-trunk. A brown spotted lady-bug climbed
the dizzy height of a grass blade, and Tom bent down close to it and
said, Lady-bug, lady-bug, fly away home, your house is on fire, your
children's alone, and she took wing and went off to see about it--which
did not surprise the boy, for he knew of old that this insect was
credulous about conflagrations, and he had practised upon its simplicity
more than once. A tumblebug came next, heaving sturdily at its ball, and
Tom touched the creature, to see it shut its legs against its body
and pretend to be dead. The birds were fairly rioting by this time. A
catbird, the Northern mocker, lit in a tree over Tom's head, and trilled
out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment; then
a shrill jay swept down, a flash of blue flame, and stopped on a twig
almost within the boy's reach, cocked his head to one side and eyed the
strangers with a consuming curiosity; a gray squirrel and a big fellow
of the fox kind came skurrying along, sitting up at intervals to
inspect and chatter at the boys, for the wild things had probably never
seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not.
All Nature was wide awake and stirring, now; long lances of sunlight
pierced down through the dense foliage far and near, and a few
butterflies came fluttering upon the scene.
Tom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with
a shout, and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and
tumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white
sandbar. They felt no longing for the little village sleeping in the
distance beyond the majestic waste of water. A vagrant current or a
slight rise in the river had carried off their raft, but this only
gratified them, since its going was something like burning the bridge
between them and civilization.
They came back to camp wonderfully refreshed, glad-hearted, and
ravenous; and they soon had the camp-fire blazing up again. Huck found a
spring of clear cold water close by, and the boys made cups of broad oak
or hickory leaves, and felt that water, sweetened with such a wildwood
charm as that, would be a good enough substitute for coffee. While Joe
was slicing bacon for breakfast, Tom and Huck asked him to hold on a
minute; they stepped to a promising nook in the river-bank and threw in
their lines; almost immediately they had reward. Joe had not had time
to get impatient before they were back again with some handsome bass,
a couple of sun-perch and a small catfish--provisions enough for quite a
family. They fried the fish with the bacon, and were astonished; for
no fish had ever seemed so delicious before. They did not know that the
quicker a fresh-water fish is on the fire after he is caught the better
he is; and they reflected little upon what a sauce open-air sleeping,
open-air exercise, bathing, and a large ingredient of hunger make, too.
They lay around in the shade, after breakfast, while Huck had a smoke,
and then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition. They
tramped gayly along, over decaying logs, through tangled underbrush,
among solemn monarchs of the forest, hung from their crowns to the
ground with a drooping regalia of grape-vines. Now and then they came
upon snug nooks carpeted with grass and jeweled with flowers.
They found plenty of things to be delighted with, but nothing to be
astonished at. They discovered that the island was about three miles
long and a quarter of a mile wide, and that the shore it lay closest to
was only separated from it by a narrow channel hardly two hundred yards
wide. They took a swim about every hour, so it was close upon the middle
of the afternoon when they got back to camp. They were too hungry to
stop to fish, but they fared sumptuously upon cold ham, and then threw
themselves down in the shade to talk. But the talk soon began to drag,
and then died. The stillness, the solemnity that brooded in the woods,
and the sense of loneliness, began to tell upon the spirits of the boys.
They fell to thinking. A sort of undefined longing crept upon them. This
took dim shape, presently--it was budding homesickness. Even Finn the
Red-Handed was dreaming of his doorsteps and empty hogsheads. But they
were all ashamed of their weakness, and none was brave enough to speak
his thought.
For some time, now, the boys had been dully conscious of a peculiar
sound in the distance, just as one sometimes is of the ticking of a
clock which he takes no distinct note of. But now this mysterious sound
became more pronounced, and forced a recognition. The boys started,
glanced at each other, and then each assumed a listening attitude. There
was a long silence, profound and unbroken; then a deep, sullen boom came
floating down out of the distance.
What is it! exclaimed Joe, under his breath.
I wonder, said Tom in a whisper.
'Tain't thunder, said Huckleberry, in an awed tone, becuz thunder--
Hark! said Tom. Listen--don't talk.
They waited a time that seemed an age, and then the same muffled boom
troubled the solemn hush.
Let's go and see.
They sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the town. They
parted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water. The little
steam ferry-boat was about a mile below the village, drifting with the
current. Her broad deck seemed crowded with people. There were a great
many skiffs rowing about or floating with the stream in the neighborhood
of the ferryboat, but the boys could not determine what the men in
them were doing. Presently a great jet of white smoke burst from the
ferryboat's side, and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud, that same
dull throb of sound was borne to the listeners again.
I know now! exclaimed Tom; somebody's drownded!
That's it! said Huck; they done that last summer, when Bill Turner
got drownded; they shoot a cannon over the water, and that makes
him come up to the top. Yes, and they take loaves of bread and put
quicksilver in 'em and set 'em afloat, and wherever there's anybody
that's drownded, they'll float right there and stop.
Yes, I've heard about that, said Joe. I wonder what makes the bread
do that.
Oh, it ain't the bread, so much, said Tom; I reckon it's mostly what
they _say_ over it before they start it out.
But they don't say anything over it, said Huck. I've seen 'em and
they don't.
Well, that's funny, said Tom. But maybe they say it to themselves. Of
_course_ they do. Anybody might know that.
The other boys agreed that there was reason in what Tom said, because
an ignorant lump of bread, uninstructed by an incantation, could not
be expected to act very intelligently when set upon an errand of such
gravity.
By jings, I wish I was over there, now, said Joe.
I do too said Huck I'd give heaps to know who it is.
The boys still listened and watched. Presently a revealing thought
flashed through Tom's mind, and he exclaimed:
Boys, I know who's drownded--it's us!
They felt like heroes in an instant. Here was a gorgeous triumph; they
were missed; they were mourned; hearts were breaking on their account;
tears were being shed; accusing memories of unkindness to these poor
lost lads were rising up, and unavailing regrets and remorse were being
indulged; and best of all, the departed were the talk of the whole town,
and the envy of all the boys, as far as this dazzling notoriety was
concerned. This was fine. It was worth while to be a pirate, after all.
As twilight drew on, the ferryboat went back to her accustomed business
and the skiffs disappeared. The pirates returned to camp. They were
jubilant with vanity over their new grandeur and the illustrious trouble
they were making. They caught fish, cooked supper and ate it, and then
fell to guessing at what the village was thinking and saying about them;
and the pictures they drew of the public distress on their account were
gratifying to look upon--from their point of view. But when the shadows
of night closed them in, they gradually ceased to talk, and sat gazing
into the fire, with their minds evidently wandering elsewhere. The
excitement was gone, now, and Tom and Joe could not keep back thoughts
of certain persons at home who were not enjoying this fine frolic as
much as they were. Misgivings came; they grew troubled and unhappy; a
sigh or two escaped, unawares. By and by Joe timidly ventured upon a
roundabout feeler as to how the others might look upon a return to
civilization--not right now, but--
Tom withered him with derision! Huck, being uncommitted as yet, joined
in with Tom, and the waverer quickly explained, and was glad to get
out of the scrape with as little taint of chicken-hearted home-sickness
clinging to his garments as he could. Mutiny was effectually laid to
rest for the moment.
As the night deepened, Huck began to nod, and presently to snore.
Joe followed next. Tom lay upon his elbow motionless, for some time,
watching the two intently. At last he got up cautiously, on his knees,
and went searching among the grass and the flickering reflections flung
by the campfire. He picked up and inspected several large semi-cylinders
of the thin white bark of a sycamore, and finally chose two which seemed
to suit him. Then he knelt by the fire and painfully wrote something
upon each of these with his red keel; one he rolled up and put in his
jacket pocket, and the other he put in Joe's hat and removed it to a
little distance from the owner. And he also put into the hat certain
schoolboy treasures of almost inestimable value--among them a lump of
chalk, an India-rubber ball, three fishhooks, and one of that kind
of marbles known as a sure 'nough crystal. Then he tiptoed his way
cautiously among the trees till he felt that he was out of hearing, and
straightway broke into a keen run in the direction of the sandbar.
CHAPTER XV
A few minutes later Tom was in the shoal water of the bar, wading toward
the Illinois shore. Before the depth reached his middle he was halfway
over; the current would permit no more wading, now, so he struck out
confidently to swim the remaining hundred yards. He swam quartering
upstream, but still was swept downward rather faster than he had
expected. However, he reached the shore finally, and drifted along till
he found a low place and drew himself out. He put his hand on his jacket
pocket, found his piece of bark safe, and then struck through the woods,
following the shore, with streaming garments. Shortly before ten
o'clock he came out into an open place opposite the village, and saw the
ferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank. Everything
was quiet under the blinking stars. He crept down the bank, watching
with all his eyes, slipped into the water, swam three or four strokes
and climbed into the skiff that did yawl duty at the boat's stern. He
laid himself down under the thwarts and waited, panting.
Presently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to cast
off. A minute or two later the skiff's head was standing high up,
against the boat's swell, and the voyage was begun. Tom felt happy in
his success, for he knew it was the boat's last trip for the night. At
the end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped, and
Tom slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk, landing fifty yards
downstream, out of danger of possible stragglers.
He flew along unfrequented alleys, and shortly found himself at his
aunt's back fence. He climbed over, approached the ell, and looked
in at the sitting-room window, for a light was burning there. There
sat Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, and Joe Harper's mother, grouped together,
talking. They were by the bed, and the bed was between them and the
door. Tom went to the door and began to softly lift the latch; then
he pressed gently and the door yielded a crack; he continued pushing
cautiously, and quaking every time it creaked, till he judged he might
squeeze through on his knees; so he put his head through and began,
warily.
What makes the candle blow so? said Aunt Polly. Tom hurried up. Why,
that door's open, I believe. Why, of course it is. No end of strange
things now. Go 'long and shut it, Sid.
Tom disappeared under the bed just in time. He lay and breathed
himself for a time, and then crept to where he could almost touch his
aunt's foot.
But as I was saying, said Aunt Polly, he warn't _bad_, so to say--only
misch_ee_vous. Only just giddy, and harum-scarum, you know. He warn't
any more responsible than a colt. _He_ never meant any harm, and he was
the best-hearted boy that ever was--and she began to cry.
It was just so with my Joe--always full of his devilment, and up to
every kind of mischief, but he was just as unselfish and kind as he
could be--and laws bless me, to think I went and whipped him for taking
that cream, never once recollecting that I throwed it out myself because
it was sour, and I never to see him again in this world, never, never,
never, poor abused boy! And Mrs. Harper sobbed as if her heart would
break.
I hope Tom's better off where he is, said Sid, but if he'd been
better in some ways--
_Sid!_ Tom felt the glare of the old lady's eye, though he could not
see it. Not a word against my Tom, now that he's gone! God'll take care
of _him_--never you trouble _your_self, sir! Oh, Mrs. Harper, I don't
know how to give him up! I don't know how to give him up! He was such a
comfort to me, although he tormented my old heart out of me, 'most.
The Lord giveth and the Lord hath taken away--Blessed be the name of
the Lord! But it's so hard--Oh, it's so hard! Only last Saturday my Joe
busted a firecracker right under my nose and I knocked him sprawling.
Little did I know then, how soon--Oh, if it was to do over again I'd hug
him and bless him for it.
Yes, yes, yes, I know just how you feel, Mrs. Harper, I know just
exactly how you feel. No longer ago than yesterday noon, my Tom took
and filled the cat full of Pain-killer, and I did think the cretur would
tear the house down. And God forgive me, I cracked Tom's head with my
thimble, poor boy, poor dead boy. But he's out of all his troubles now.
And the last words I ever heard him say was to reproach--
But this memory was too much for the old lady, and she broke entirely
down. Tom was snuffling, now, himself--and more in pity of himself than
anybody else. He could hear Mary crying, and putting in a kindly word
for him from time to time. He began to have a nobler opinion of himself
than ever before. Still, he was sufficiently touched by his aunt's grief
to long to rush out from under the bed and overwhelm her with joy--and
the theatrical gorgeousness of the thing appealed strongly to his
nature, too, but he resisted and lay still.
He went on listening, and gathered by odds and ends that it was
conjectured at first that the boys had got drowned while taking a swim;
then the small raft had been missed; next, certain boys said the missing
lads had promised that the village should hear something soon; the
wise-heads had put this and that together and decided that the lads
had gone off on that raft and would turn up at the next town below,
presently; but toward noon the raft had been found, lodged against the
Missouri shore some five or six miles below the village--and then hope
perished; they must be drowned, else hunger would have driven them home
by nightfall if not sooner. It was believed that the search for the
bodies had been a fruitless effort merely because the drowning must
have occurred in mid-channel, since the boys, being good swimmers, would
otherwise have escaped to shore. This was Wednesday night. If the bodies
continued missing until Sunday, all hope would be given over, and the
funerals would be preached on that morning. Tom shuddered.
Mrs. Harper gave a sobbing goodnight and turned to go. Then with a
mutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each other's
arms and had a good, consoling cry, and then parted. Aunt Polly was
tender far beyond her wont, in her goodnight to Sid and Mary. Sid
snuffled a bit and Mary went off crying with all her heart.
Aunt Polly knelt down and prayed for Tom so touchingly, so appealingly,
and with such measureless love in her words and her old trembling voice,
that he was weltering in tears again, long before she was through.
He had to keep still long after she went to bed, for she kept making
broken-hearted ejaculations from time to time, tossing unrestfully, and
turning over. But at last she was still, only moaning a little in her
sleep. Now the boy stole out, rose gradually by the bedside, shaded the
candle-light with his hand, and stood regarding her. His heart was full
of pity for her. He took out his sycamore scroll and placed it by the
candle. But something occurred to him, and he lingered considering.
His face lighted with a happy solution of his thought; he put the bark
hastily in his pocket. Then he bent over and kissed the faded lips, and
straightway made his stealthy exit, latching the door behind him.
He threaded his way back to the ferry landing, found nobody at large
there, and walked boldly on board the boat, for he knew she was
tenantless except that there was a watchman, who always turned in and
slept like a graven image. He untied the skiff at the stern, slipped
into it, and was soon rowing cautiously upstream. When he had pulled a
mile above the village, he started quartering across and bent himself
stoutly to his work. He hit the landing on the other side neatly, for
this was a familiar bit of work to him. He was moved to capture
the skiff, arguing that it might be considered a ship and therefore
legitimate prey for a pirate, but he knew a thorough search would be
made for it and that might end in revelations. So he stepped ashore and
entered the woods.
He sat down and took a long rest, torturing himself meanwhile to keep
awake, and then started warily down the home-stretch. The night was far
spent. It was broad daylight before he found himself fairly abreast the
island bar. He rested again until the sun was well up and gilding the
great river with its splendor, and then he plunged into the stream. A
little later he paused, dripping, upon the threshold of the camp, and
heard Joe say:
No, Tom's true-blue, Huck, and he'll come back. He won't desert. He
knows that would be a disgrace to a pirate, and Tom's too proud for that
sort of thing. He's up to something or other. Now I wonder what?
Well, the things is ours, anyway, ain't they?
Pretty near, but not yet, Huck. The writing says they are if he ain't
back here to breakfast.
Which he is! exclaimed Tom, with fine dramatic effect, stepping
grandly into camp.
A sumptuous breakfast of bacon and fish was shortly provided, and as the
boys set to work upon it, Tom recounted (and adorned) his adventures.
They were a vain and boastful company of heroes when the tale was done.
Then Tom hid himself away in a shady nook to sleep till noon, and the
other pirates got ready to fish and explore.
CHAPTER XVI
AFTER dinner all the gang turned out to hunt for turtle eggs on the bar.
They went about poking sticks into the sand, and when they found a soft
place they went down on their knees and dug with their hands. Sometimes
they would take fifty or sixty eggs out of one hole. They were perfectly
round white things a trifle smaller than an English walnut. They had a
famous fried-egg feast that night, and another on Friday morning.
After breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar, and
chased each other round and round, shedding clothes as they went, until
they were naked, and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal
water of the bar, against the stiff current, which latter tripped their
legs from under them from time to time and greatly increased the fun.
And now and then they stooped in a group and splashed water in each
other's faces with their palms, gradually approaching each other, with
averted faces to avoid the strangling sprays, and finally gripping and
struggling till the best man ducked his neighbor, and then they all
went under in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing,
sputtering, laughing, and gasping for breath at one and the same time.
When they were well exhausted, they would run out and sprawl on the dry,
hot sand, and lie there and cover themselves up with it, and by and by
break for the water again and go through the original performance once
more. Finally it occurred to them that their naked skin represented
flesh-colored tights very fairly; so they drew a ring in the sand and
had a circus--with three clowns in it, for none would yield this proudest
post to his neighbor.
Next they got their marbles and played knucks and ringtaw and
keeps till that amusement grew stale. Then Joe and Huck had another
swim, but Tom would not venture, because he found that in kicking off
his trousers he had kicked his string of rattlesnake rattles off his
ankle, and he wondered how he had escaped cramp so long without the
protection of this mysterious charm. He did not venture again until he
had found it, and by that time the other boys were tired and ready to
rest. They gradually wandered apart, dropped into the dumps, and
fell to gazing longingly across the wide river to where the village lay
drowsing in the sun. Tom found himself writing BECKY in the sand with
his big toe; he scratched it out, and was angry with himself for his
weakness. But he wrote it again, nevertheless; he could not help it. He
erased it once more and then took himself out of temptation by driving
the other boys together and joining them.
But Joe's spirits had gone down almost beyond resurrection. He was so
homesick that he could hardly endure the misery of it. The tears lay
very near the surface. Huck was melancholy, too. Tom was downhearted,
but tried hard not to show it. He had a secret which he was not ready
to tell, yet, but if this mutinous depression was not broken up soon, he
would have to bring it out. He said, with a great show of cheerfulness:
I bet there's been pirates on this island before, boys. We'll explore
it again. They've hid treasures here somewhere. How'd you feel to light
on a rotten chest full of gold and silver--hey?
But it roused only faint enthusiasm, which faded out, with no reply.
Tom tried one or two other seductions; but they failed, too. It was
discouraging work. Joe sat poking up the sand with a stick and looking
very gloomy. Finally he said:
Oh, boys, let's give it up. I want to go home. It's so lonesome.
Oh no, Joe, you'll feel better by and by, said Tom. Just think of the
fishing that's here.
I don't care for fishing. I want to go home.
But, Joe, there ain't such another swimming-place anywhere.
Swimming's no good. I don't seem to care for it, somehow, when there
ain't anybody to say I sha'n't go in. I mean to go home.
Oh, shucks! Baby! You want to see your mother, I reckon.
Yes, I _do_ want to see my mother--and you would, too, if you had one. I
ain't any more baby than you are. And Joe snuffled a little.
Well, we'll let the crybaby go home to his mother, won't we, Huck? Poor
thing--does it want to see its mother? And so it shall. You like it here,
don't you, Huck? We'll stay, won't we?
Huck said, Y-e-s--without any heart in it.
I'll never speak to you again as long as I live, said Joe, rising.
There now! And he moved moodily away and began to dress himself.
Who cares! said Tom. Nobody wants you to. Go 'long home and get
laughed at. Oh, you're a nice pirate. Huck and me ain't crybabies. We'll
stay, won't we, Huck? Let him go if he wants to. I reckon we can get
along without him, per'aps.
But Tom was uneasy, nevertheless, and was alarmed to see Joe go sullenly
on with his dressing. And then it was discomforting to see Huck eying
Joe's preparations so wistfully, and keeping up such an ominous silence.
Presently, without a parting word, Joe began to wade off toward the
Illinois shore. Tom's heart began to sink. He glanced at Huck. Huck
could not bear the look, and dropped his eyes. Then he said:
I want to go, too, Tom. It was getting so lonesome anyway, and now
it'll be worse. Let's us go, too, Tom.
I won't! You can all go, if you want to. I mean to stay.
Tom, I better go.
Well, go 'long--who's hendering you.
Huck began to pick up his scattered clothes. He said:
Tom, I wisht you'd come, too. Now you think it over. We'll wait for you
when we get to shore.
Well, you'll wait a blame long time, that's all.
Huck started sorrowfully away, and Tom stood looking after him, with a
strong desire tugging at his heart to yield his pride and go along
too. He hoped the boys would stop, but they still waded slowly on. It
suddenly dawned on Tom that it was become very lonely and still. He made
one final struggle with his pride, and then darted after his comrades,
yelling:
Wait! Wait! I want to tell you something!
They presently stopped and turned around. When he got to where they
were, he began unfolding his secret, and they listened moodily till
at last they saw the point he was driving at, and then they set up a
warwhoop of applause and said it was splendid! and said if he had
told them at first, they wouldn't have started away. He made a plausible
excuse; but his real reason had been the fear that not even the secret
would keep them with him any very great length of time, and so he had
meant to hold it in reserve as a last seduction.
The lads came gayly back and went at their sports again with a will,
chattering all the time about Tom's stupendous plan and admiring the
genius of it. After a dainty egg and fish dinner, Tom said he wanted to
learn to smoke, now. Joe caught at the idea and said he would like to
try, too. So Huck made pipes and filled them. These novices had never
smoked anything before but cigars made of grapevine, and they bit the
tongue, and were not considered manly anyway.
Now they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puff,
charily, and with slender confidence. The smoke had an unpleasant taste,
and they gagged a little, but Tom said:
Why, it's just as easy! If I'd a knowed this was all, I'd a learnt long
ago.
So would I, said Joe. It's just nothing.
Why, many a time I've looked at people smoking, and thought well I wish
I could do that; but I never thought I could, said Tom.
That's just the way with me, hain't it, Huck? You've heard me talk just
that way--haven't you, Huck? I'll leave it to Huck if I haven't.
Yes--heaps of times, said Huck.
Well, I have too, said Tom; oh, hundreds of times. Once down by the
slaughter-house. Don't you remember, Huck? Bob Tanner was there, and
Johnny Miller, and Jeff Thatcher, when I said it. Don't you remember,
Huck, 'bout me saying that?
Yes, that's so, said Huck. That was the day after I lost a white
alley. No, 'twas the day before.
There--I told you so, said Tom. Huck recollects it.
I bleeve I could smoke this pipe all day, said Joe. I don't feel
sick.
Neither do I, said Tom. I could smoke it all day. But I bet you Jeff
Thatcher couldn't.
Jeff Thatcher! Why, he'd keel over just with two draws. Just let him
try it once. _He'd_ see!
I bet he would. And Johnny Miller--I wish could see Johnny Miller tackle
it once.
Oh, don't I! said Joe. Why, I bet you Johnny Miller couldn't any more
do this than nothing. Just one little snifter would fetch _him_.
'Deed it would, Joe. Say--I wish the boys could see us now.
So do I.
Say--boys, don't say anything about it, and some time when they're
around, I'll come up to you and say, 'Joe, got a pipe? I want a smoke.'
And you'll say, kind of careless like, as if it warn't anything, you'll
say, 'Yes, I got my _old_ pipe, and another one, but my tobacker ain't
very good.' And I'll say, 'Oh, that's all right, if it's _strong_
enough.' And then you'll out with the pipes, and we'll light up just as
ca'm, and then just see 'em look!
By jings, that'll be gay, Tom! I wish it was _now_!
So do I! And when we tell 'em we learned when we was off pirating,
won't they wish they'd been along?
Oh, I reckon not! I'll just _bet_ they will!
So the talk ran on. But presently it began to flag a trifle, and
grow disjointed. The silences widened; the expectoration marvellously
increased. Every pore inside the boys' cheeks became a spouting
fountain; they could scarcely bail out the cellars under their tongues
fast enough to prevent an inundation; little overflowings down their
throats occurred in spite of all they could do, and sudden retchings
followed every time. Both boys were looking very pale and miserable,
now. Joe's pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers. Tom's followed. Both
fountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might and
main. Joe said feebly:
I've lost my knife. I reckon I better go and find it.
Tom said, with quivering lips and halting utterance:
I'll help you. You go over that way and I'll hunt around by the spring.
No, you needn't come, Huck--we can find it.
So Huck sat down again, and waited an hour. Then he found it lonesome,
and went to find his comrades. They were wide apart in the woods, both
very pale, both fast asleep. But something informed him that if they had
had any trouble they had got rid of it.
They were not talkative at supper that night. They had a humble look,
and when Huck prepared his pipe after the meal and was going to prepare
theirs, they said no, they were not feeling very well--something they ate
at dinner had disagreed with them.
About midnight Joe awoke, and called the boys. There was a brooding
oppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode something. The boys
huddled themselves together and sought the friendly companionship of
the fire, though the dull dead heat of the breathless atmosphere was
stifling. They sat still, intent and waiting. The solemn hush continued.
Beyond the light of the fire everything was swallowed up in the
blackness of darkness. Presently there came a quivering glow that
vaguely revealed the foliage for a moment and then vanished. By and by
another came, a little stronger. Then another. Then a faint moan came
sighing through the branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleeting
breath upon their cheeks, and shuddered with the fancy that the Spirit
of the Night had gone by. There was a pause. Now a weird flash turned
night into day and showed every little grassblade, separate and
distinct, that grew about their feet. And it showed three white,
startled faces, too. A deep peal of thunder went rolling and tumbling
down the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in the distance. A
sweep of chilly air passed by, rustling all the leaves and snowing the
flaky ashes broadcast about the fire. Another fierce glare lit up the
forest and an instant crash followed that seemed to rend the treetops
right over the boys' heads. They clung together in terror, in the thick
gloom that followed. A few big raindrops fell pattering upon the leaves.
Quick! boys, go for the tent! exclaimed Tom.
They sprang away, stumbling over roots and among vines in the dark, no
two plunging in the same direction. A furious blast roared through
the trees, making everything sing as it went. One blinding flash after
another came, and peal on peal of deafening thunder. And now a drenching
rain poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets along the
ground. The boys cried out to each other, but the roaring wind and the
booming thunderblasts drowned their voices utterly. However, one by one
they straggled in at last and took shelter under the tent, cold, scared,
and streaming with water; but to have company in misery seemed something
to be grateful for. They could not talk, the old sail flapped so
furiously, even if the other noises would have allowed them. The tempest
rose higher and higher, and presently the sail tore loose from its
fastenings and went winging away on the blast. The boys seized each
others' hands and fled, with many tumblings and bruises, to the shelter
of a great oak that stood upon the riverbank. Now the battle was at its
highest. Under the ceaseless conflagration of lightning that flamed
in the skies, everything below stood out in cleancut and shadowless
distinctness: the bending trees, the billowy river, white with foam, the
driving spray of spumeflakes, the dim outlines of the high bluffs on
the other side, glimpsed through the drifting cloudrack and the slanting
veil of rain. Every little while some giant tree yielded the fight
and fell crashing through the younger growth; and the unflagging
thunderpeals came now in ear-splitting explosive bursts, keen and sharp,
and unspeakably appalling. The storm culminated in one matchless effort
that seemed likely to tear the island to pieces, burn it up, drown it to
the treetops, blow it away, and deafen every creature in it, all at one
and the same moment. It was a wild night for homeless young heads to be
out in.
But at last the battle was done, and the forces retired with weaker and
weaker threatenings and grumblings, and peace resumed her sway. The
boys went back to camp, a good deal awed; but they found there was still
something to be thankful for, because the great sycamore, the shelter
of their beds, was a ruin, now, blasted by the lightnings, and they were
not under it when the catastrophe happened.
Everything in camp was drenched, the campfire as well; for they were but
heedless lads, like their generation, and had made no provision against
rain. Here was matter for dismay, for they were soaked through and
chilled. They were eloquent in their distress; but they presently
discovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had
been built against (where it curved upward and separated itself from
the ground), that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting; so they
patiently wrought until, with shreds and bark gathered from the under
sides of sheltered logs, they coaxed the fire to burn again. Then they
piled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace, and were
gladhearted once more. They dried their boiled ham and had a feast,
and after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified their
midnight adventure until morning, for there was not a dry spot to sleep
on, anywhere around.
As the sun began to steal in upon the boys, drowsiness came over
them, and they went out on the sandbar and lay down to sleep. They got
scorched out by and by, and drearily set about getting breakfast. After
the meal they felt rusty, and stiff-jointed, and a little homesick once
more. Tom saw the signs, and fell to cheering up the pirates as well as
he could. But they cared nothing for marbles, or circus, or swimming, or
anything. He reminded them of the imposing secret, and raised a ray of
cheer. While it lasted, he got them interested in a new device. This was
to knock off being pirates, for a while, and be Indians for a change.
They were attracted by this idea; so it was not long before they were
stripped, and striped from head to heel with black mud, like so many
zebras--all of them chiefs, of course--and then they went tearing through
the woods to attack an English settlement.
By and by they separated into three hostile tribes, and darted upon each
other from ambush with dreadful warwhoops, and killed and scalped each
other by thousands. It was a gory day. Consequently it was an extremely
satisfactory one.
They assembled in camp toward suppertime, hungry and happy; but now
a difficulty arose--hostile Indians could not break the bread of
hospitality together without first making peace, and this was a simple
impossibility without smoking a pipe of peace. There was no other
process that ever they had heard of. Two of the savages almost wished
they had remained pirates. However, there was no other way; so with such
show of cheerfulness as they could muster they called for the pipe and
took their whiff as it passed, in due form.
And behold, they were glad they had gone into savagery, for they had
gained something; they found that they could now smoke a little without
having to go and hunt for a lost knife; they did not get sick enough to
be seriously uncomfortable. They were not likely to fool away this high
promise for lack of effort. No, they practised cautiously, after supper,
with right fair success, and so they spent a jubilant evening. They were
prouder and happier in their new acquirement than they would have been
in the scalping and skinning of the Six Nations. We will leave them to
smoke and chatter and brag, since we have no further use for them at
present.
CHAPTER XVII
BUT there was no hilarity in the little town that same tranquil Saturday
afternoon. The Harpers, and Aunt Polly's family, were being put into
mourning, with great grief and many tears. An unusual quiet possessed
the village, although it was ordinarily quiet enough, in all conscience.
The villagers conducted their concerns with an absent air, and talked
little; but they sighed often. The Saturday holiday seemed a burden to
the children. They had no heart in their sports, and gradually gave them
up.
In the afternoon Becky Thatcher found herself moping about the deserted
schoolhouse yard, and feeling very melancholy. But she found nothing
there to comfort her. She soliloquized:
Oh, if I only had a brass andiron-knob again! But I haven't got
anything now to remember him by. And she choked back a little sob.
Presently she stopped, and said to herself:
It was right here. Oh, if it was to do over again, I wouldn't say
that--I wouldn't say it for the whole world. But he's gone now; I'll
never, never, never see him any more.
This thought broke her down, and she wandered away, with tears rolling
down her cheeks. Then quite a group of boys and girls--playmates of Tom's
and Joe's--came by, and stood looking over the paling fence and talking
in reverent tones of how Tom did so-and-so the last time they saw
him, and how Joe said this and that small trifle (pregnant with awful
prophecy, as they could easily see now!)--and each speaker pointed out
the exact spot where the lost lads stood at the time, and then added
something like and I was a-standing just so--just as I am now, and as if
you was him--I was as close as that--and he smiled, just this way--and then
something seemed to go all over me, like--awful, you know--and I never
thought what it meant, of course, but I can see now!
Then there was a dispute about who saw the dead boys last in life, and
many claimed that dismal distinction, and offered evidences, more or
less tampered with by the witness; and when it was ultimately decided
who _did_ see the departed last, and exchanged the last words with them,
the lucky parties took upon themselves a sort of sacred importance,
and were gaped at and envied by all the rest. One poor chap, who had
no other grandeur to offer, said with tolerably manifest pride in the
remembrance:
Well, Tom Sawyer he licked me once.
But that bid for glory was a failure. Most of the boys could say that,
and so that cheapened the distinction too much. The group loitered away,
still recalling memories of the lost heroes, in awed voices.
When the Sunday-school hour was finished, the next morning, the bell
began to toll, instead of ringing in the usual way. It was a very still
Sabbath, and the mournful sound seemed in keeping with the musing hush
that lay upon nature. The villagers began to gather, loitering a moment
in the vestibule to converse in whispers about the sad event. But there
was no whispering in the house; only the funereal rustling of dresses
as the women gathered to their seats disturbed the silence there. None
could remember when the little church had been so full before. There
was finally a waiting pause, an expectant dumbness, and then Aunt Polly
entered, followed by Sid and Mary, and they by the Harper family, all in
deep black, and the whole congregation, the old minister as well, rose
reverently and stood until the mourners were seated in the front pew.
There was another communing silence, broken at intervals by muffled
sobs, and then the minister spread his hands abroad and prayed. A moving
hymn was sung, and the text followed: I am the Resurrection and the
Life.
As the service proceeded, the clergyman drew such pictures of the
graces, the winning ways, and the rare promise of the lost lads that
every soul there, thinking he recognized these pictures, felt a pang
in remembering that he had persistently blinded himself to them always
before, and had as persistently seen only faults and flaws in the poor
boys. The minister related many a touching incident in the lives of the
departed, too, which illustrated their sweet, generous natures, and the
people could easily see, now, how noble and beautiful those episodes
were, and remembered with grief that at the time they occurred they had
seemed rank rascalities, well deserving of the cowhide. The congregation
became more and more moved, as the pathetic tale went on, till at last
the whole company broke down and joined the weeping mourners in a chorus
of anguished sobs, the preacher himself giving way to his feelings, and
crying in the pulpit.
There was a rustle in the gallery, which nobody noticed; a moment later
the church door creaked; the minister raised his streaming eyes above
his handkerchief, and stood transfixed! First one and then another pair
of eyes followed the minister's, and then almost with one impulse the
congregation rose and stared while the three dead boys came marching up
the aisle, Tom in the lead, Joe next, and Huck, a ruin of drooping rags,
sneaking sheepishly in the rear! They had been hid in the unused gallery
listening to their own funeral sermon!
Aunt Polly, Mary, and the Harpers threw themselves upon their restored
ones, smothered them with kisses and poured out thanksgivings, while
poor Huck stood abashed and uncomfortable, not knowing exactly what
to do or where to hide from so many unwelcoming eyes. He wavered, and
started to slink away, but Tom seized him and said:
Aunt Polly, it ain't fair. Somebody's got to be glad to see Huck.
And so they shall. I'm glad to see him, poor motherless thing! And
the loving attentions Aunt Polly lavished upon him were the one thing
capable of making him more uncomfortable than he was before.
Suddenly the minister shouted at the top of his voice: Praise God from
whom all blessings flow--_sing_!--and put your hearts in it!
And they did. Old Hundred swelled up with a triumphant burst, and
while it shook the rafters Tom Sawyer the Pirate looked around upon the
envying juveniles about him and confessed in his heart that this was the
proudest moment of his life.
As the sold congregation trooped out they said they would almost be
willing to be made ridiculous again to hear Old Hundred sung like that
once more.
Tom got more cuffs and kisses that day--according to Aunt Polly's varying
moods--than he had earned before in a year; and he hardly knew which
expressed the most gratefulness to God and affection for himself.
CHAPTER XVIII
THAT was Tom's great secret--the scheme to return home with his brother
pirates and attend their own funerals. They had paddled over to the
Missouri shore on a log, at dusk on Saturday, landing five or six miles
below the village; they had slept in the woods at the edge of the town
till nearly daylight, and had then crept through back lanes and alleys
and finished their sleep in the gallery of the church among a chaos of
invalided benches.
At breakfast, Monday morning, Aunt Polly and Mary were very loving to
Tom, and very attentive to his wants. There was an unusual amount of
talk. In the course of it Aunt Polly said:
Well, I don't say it wasn't a fine joke, Tom, to keep everybody
suffering 'most a week so you boys had a good time, but it is a pity you
could be so hard-hearted as to let me suffer so. If you could come over
on a log to go to your funeral, you could have come over and give me a
hint some way that you warn't dead, but only run off.
Yes, you could have done that, Tom, said Mary; and I believe you
would if you had thought of it.
Would you, Tom? said Aunt Polly, her face lighting wistfully. Say,
now, would you, if you'd thought of it?
I--well, I don't know. 'Twould 'a' spoiled everything.
Tom, I hoped you loved me that much, said Aunt Polly, with a grieved
tone that discomforted the boy. It would have been something if you'd
cared enough to _think_ of it, even if you didn't _do_ it.
Now, auntie, that ain't any harm, pleaded Mary; it's only Tom's giddy
way--he is always in such a rush that he never thinks of anything.
More's the pity. Sid would have thought. And Sid would have come and
_done_ it, too. Tom, you'll look back, some day, when it's too late,
and wish you'd cared a little more for me when it would have cost you so
little.
Now, auntie, you know I do care for you, said Tom.
I'd know it better if you acted more like it.
I wish now I'd thought, said Tom, with a repentant tone; but I dreamt
about you, anyway. That's something, ain't it?
It ain't much--a cat does that much--but it's better than nothing. What
did you dream?
Why, Wednesday night I dreamt that you was sitting over there by the
bed, and Sid was sitting by the woodbox, and Mary next to him.
Well, so we did. So we always do. I'm glad your dreams could take even
that much trouble about us.
And I dreamt that Joe Harper's mother was here.
Why, she was here! Did you dream any more?
Oh, lots. But it's so dim, now.
Well, try to recollect--can't you?
Somehow it seems to me that the wind--the wind blowed the--the--
Try harder, Tom! The wind did blow something. Come!
Tom pressed his fingers on his forehead an anxious minute, and then
said:
I've got it now! I've got it now! It blowed the candle!
Mercy on us! Go on, Tom--go on!
And it seems to me that you said, 'Why, I believe that that door--'
Go _on_, Tom!
Just let me study a moment--just a moment. Oh, yes--you said you believed
the door was open.
As I'm sitting here, I did! Didn't I, Mary! Go on!
And then--and then--well I won't be certain, but it seems like as if you
made Sid go and--and--
Well? Well? What did I make him do, Tom? What did I make him do?
You made him--you--Oh, you made him shut it.
Well, for the land's sake! I never heard the beat of that in all my
days! Don't tell _me_ there ain't anything in dreams, any more. Sereny
Harper shall know of this before I'm an hour older. I'd like to see her
get around _this_ with her rubbage 'bout superstition. Go on, Tom!
Oh, it's all getting just as bright as day, now. Next you said I warn't
_bad_, only mischeevous and harum-scarum, and not any more responsible
than--than--I think it was a colt, or something.
And so it was! Well, goodness gracious! Go on, Tom!
And then you began to cry.
So I did. So I did. Not the first time, neither. And then--
Then Mrs. Harper she began to cry, and said Joe was just the same, and
she wished she hadn't whipped him for taking cream when she'd throwed it
out her own self--
Tom! The sperrit was upon you! You was a prophesying--that's what you
was doing! Land alive, go on, Tom!
Then Sid he said--he said--
I don't think I said anything, said Sid.
Yes you did, Sid, said Mary.
Shut your heads and let Tom go on! What did he say, Tom?
He said--I _think_ he said he hoped I was better off where I was gone
to, but if I'd been better sometimes--
_There_, d'you hear that! It was his very words!
And you shut him up sharp.
I lay I did! There must 'a' been an angel there. There _was_ an angel
there, somewheres!
And Mrs. Harper told about Joe scaring her with a firecracker, and you
told about Peter and the Pain-killer--
Just as true as I live!
And then there was a whole lot of talk 'bout dragging the river for us,
and 'bout having the funeral Sunday, and then you and old Miss Harper
hugged and cried, and she went.
It happened just so! It happened just so, as sure as I'm a-sitting in
these very tracks. Tom, you couldn't told it more like if you'd 'a' seen
it! And then what? Go on, Tom!
Then I thought you prayed for me--and I could see you and hear every
word you said. And you went to bed, and I was so sorry that I took and
wrote on a piece of sycamore bark, 'We ain't dead--we are only off being
pirates,' and put it on the table by the candle; and then you looked
so good, laying there asleep, that I thought I went and leaned over and
kissed you on the lips.
Did you, Tom, _did_ you! I just forgive you everything for that! And
she seized the boy in a crushing embrace that made him feel like the
guiltiest of villains.
It was very kind, even though it was only a--dream, Sid soliloquized
just audibly.
Shut up, Sid! A body does just the same in a dream as he'd do if he was
awake. Here's a big Milum apple I've been saving for you, Tom, if you
was ever found again--now go 'long to school. I'm thankful to the good
God and Father of us all I've got you back, that's long-suffering and
merciful to them that believe on Him and keep His word, though goodness
knows I'm unworthy of it, but if only the worthy ones got His blessings
and had His hand to help them over the rough places, there's few enough
would smile here or ever enter into His rest when the long night comes.
Go 'long Sid, Mary, Tom--take yourselves off--you've hendered me long
enough.
The children left for school, and the old lady to call on Mrs. Harper
and vanquish her realism with Tom's marvellous dream. Sid had better
judgment than to utter the thought that was in his mind as he left the
house. It was this: Pretty thin--as long a dream as that, without any
mistakes in it!
What a hero Tom was become, now! He did not go skipping and prancing,
but moved with a dignified swagger as became a pirate who felt that the
public eye was on him. And indeed it was; he tried not to seem to see
the looks or hear the remarks as he passed along, but they were food and
drink to him. Smaller boys than himself flocked at his heels, as proud
to be seen with him, and tolerated by him, as if he had been the drummer
at the head of a procession or the elephant leading a menagerie into
town. Boys of his own size pretended not to know he had been away at
all; but they were consuming with envy, nevertheless. They would have
given anything to have that swarthy sun-tanned skin of his, and his
glittering notoriety; and Tom would not have parted with either for a
circus.
At school the children made so much of him and of Joe, and delivered
such eloquent admiration from their eyes, that the two heroes were
not long in becoming insufferably stuck-up. They began to tell their
adventures to hungry listeners--but they only began; it was not a
thing likely to have an end, with imaginations like theirs to furnish
material. And finally, when they got out their pipes and went serenely
puffing around, the very summit of glory was reached.
Tom decided that he could be independent of Becky Thatcher now. Glory
was sufficient. He would live for glory. Now that he was distinguished,
maybe she would be wanting to make up. Well, let her--she should see
that he could be as indifferent as some other people. Presently she
arrived. Tom pretended not to see her. He moved away and joined a group
of boys and girls and began to talk. Soon he observed that she was
tripping gayly back and forth with flushed face and dancing eyes,
pretending to be busy chasing schoolmates, and screaming with laughter
when she made a capture; but he noticed that she always made her
captures in his vicinity, and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye
in his direction at such times, too. It gratified all the vicious vanity
that was in him; and so, instead of winning him, it only set him up
the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that he
knew she was about. Presently she gave over skylarking, and moved
irresolutely about, sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and
wistfully toward Tom. Then she observed that now Tom was talking more
particularly to Amy Lawrence than to any one else. She felt a sharp pang
and grew disturbed and uneasy at once. She tried to go away, but her
feet were treacherous, and carried her to the group instead. She said to
a girl almost at Tom's elbow--with sham vivacity:
Why, Mary Austin! you bad girl, why didn't you come to Sunday-school?
I did come--didn't you see me?
Why, no! Did you? Where did you sit?
I was in Miss Peters' class, where I always go. I saw _you_.
Did you? Why, it's funny I didn't see you. I wanted to tell you about
the picnic.
Oh, that's jolly. Who's going to give it?
My ma's going to let me have one.
Oh, goody; I hope she'll let _me_ come.
Well, she will. The picnic's for me. She'll let anybody come that I
want, and I want you.
That's ever so nice. When is it going to be?
By and by. Maybe about vacation.
Oh, won't it be fun! You going to have all the girls and boys?
Yes, every one that's friends to me--or wants to be; and she glanced
ever so furtively at Tom, but he talked right along to Amy Lawrence
about the terrible storm on the island, and how the lightning tore the
great sycamore tree all to flinders while he was standing within
three feet of it.
Oh, may I come? said Grace Miller.
Yes.
And me? said Sally Rogers.
Yes.
And me, too? said Susy Harper. And Joe?
Yes.
And so on, with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged
for invitations but Tom and Amy. Then Tom turned coolly away, still
talking, and took Amy with him. Becky's lips trembled and the tears
came to her eyes; she hid these signs with a forced gayety and went on
chattering, but the life had gone out of the picnic, now, and out of
everything else; she got away as soon as she could and hid herself and
had what her sex call a good cry. Then she sat moody, with wounded
pride, till the bell rang. She roused up, now, with a vindictive cast
in her eye, and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew what
_she'd_ do.
At recess Tom continued his flirtation with Amy with jubilant
self-satisfaction. And he kept drifting about to find Becky and lacerate
her with the performance. At last he spied her, but there was a sudden
falling of his mercury. She was sitting cosily on a little bench behind
the schoolhouse looking at a picture-book with Alfred Temple--and so
absorbed were they, and their heads so close together over the book,
that they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides.
Jealousy ran red-hot through Tom's veins. He began to hate himself for
throwing away the chance Becky had offered for a reconciliation. He
called himself a fool, and all the hard names he could think of. He
wanted to cry with vexation. Amy chatted happily along, as they walked,
for her heart was singing, but Tom's tongue had lost its function. He
did not hear what Amy was saying, and whenever she paused expectantly
he could only stammer an awkward assent, which was as often misplaced
as otherwise. He kept drifting to the rear of the schoolhouse, again and
again, to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there. He could
not help it. And it maddened him to see, as he thought he saw, that
Becky Thatcher never once suspected that he was even in the land of the
living. But she did see, nevertheless; and she knew she was winning her
fight, too, and was glad to see him suffer as she had suffered.
Amy's happy prattle became intolerable. Tom hinted at things he had
to attend to; things that must be done; and time was fleeting. But in
vain--the girl chirped on. Tom thought, Oh, hang her, ain't I ever going
to get rid of her? At last he must be attending to those things--and she
said artlessly that she would be around when school let out. And he
hastened away, hating her for it.
Any other boy! Tom thought, grating his teeth. Any boy in the whole
town but that Saint Louis smarty that thinks he dresses so fine and is
aristocracy! Oh, all right, I licked you the first day you ever saw this
town, mister, and I'll lick you again! You just wait till I catch you
out! I'll just take and--
And he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary boy--pummelling
the air, and kicking and gouging. Oh, you do, do you? You holler
'nough, do you? Now, then, let that learn you! And so the imaginary
flogging was finished to his satisfaction.
Tom fled home at noon. His conscience could not endure any more of Amy's
grateful happiness, and his jealousy could bear no more of the other
distress. Becky resumed her picture inspections with Alfred, but as the
minutes dragged along and no Tom came to suffer, her triumph began to
cloud and she lost interest; gravity and absentmindedness followed,
and then melancholy; two or three times she pricked up her ear at
a footstep, but it was a false hope; no Tom came. At last she grew
entirely miserable and wished she hadn't carried it so far. When
poor Alfred, seeing that he was losing her, he did not know how, kept
exclaiming: Oh, here's a jolly one! look at this! she lost patience at
last, and said, Oh, don't bother me! I don't care for them! and burst
into tears, and got up and walked away.
Alfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her, but she
said:
Go away and leave me alone, can't you! I hate you!
So the boy halted, wondering what he could have done--for she had said
she would look at pictures all through the nooning--and she walked on,
crying. Then Alfred went musing into the deserted schoolhouse. He was
humiliated and angry. He easily guessed his way to the truth--the girl
had simply made a convenience of him to vent her spite upon Tom Sawyer.
He was far from hating Tom the less when this thought occurred to him.
He wished there was some way to get that boy into trouble without much
risk to himself. Tom's spelling-book fell under his eye. Here was his
opportunity. He gratefully opened to the lesson for the afternoon and
poured ink upon the page.
Becky, glancing in at a window behind him at the moment, saw the act,
and moved on, without discovering herself. She started homeward, now,
intending to find Tom and tell him; Tom would be thankful and their
troubles would be healed. Before she was half way home, however, she
had changed her mind. The thought of Tom's treatment of her when she was
talking about her picnic came scorching back and filled her with shame.
She resolved to let him get whipped on the damaged spelling-book's
account, and to hate him forever, into the bargain.
CHAPTER XIX
TOM arrived at home in a dreary mood, and the first thing his aunt said
to him showed him that he had brought his sorrows to an unpromising
market:
Tom, I've a notion to skin you alive!
Auntie, what have I done?
Well, you've done enough. Here I go over to Sereny Harper, like an old
softy, expecting I'm going to make her believe all that rubbage about
that dream, when lo and behold you she'd found out from Joe that you was
over here and heard all the talk we had that night. Tom, I don't know
what is to become of a boy that will act like that. It makes me feel so
bad to think you could let me go to Sereny Harper and make such a fool
of myself and never say a word.
This was a new aspect of the thing. His smartness of the morning had
seemed to Tom a good joke before, and very ingenious. It merely looked
mean and shabby now. He hung his head and could not think of anything to
say for a moment. Then he said:
Auntie, I wish I hadn't done it--but I didn't think.
Oh, child, you never think. You never think of anything but your
own selfishness. You could think to come all the way over here from
Jackson's Island in the night to laugh at our troubles, and you could
think to fool me with a lie about a dream; but you couldn't ever think
to pity us and save us from sorrow.
Auntie, I know now it was mean, but I didn't mean to be mean. I didn't,
honest. And besides, I didn't come over here to laugh at you that
night.
What did you come for, then?
It was to tell you not to be uneasy about us, because we hadn't got
drownded.
Tom, Tom, I would be the thankfullest soul in this world if I could
believe you ever had as good a thought as that, but you know you never
did--and I know it, Tom.
Indeed and 'deed I did, auntie--I wish I may never stir if I didn't.
Oh, Tom, don't lie--don't do it. It only makes things a hundred times
worse.
It ain't a lie, auntie; it's the truth. I wanted to keep you from
grieving--that was all that made me come.
I'd give the whole world to believe that--it would cover up a power
of sins, Tom. I'd 'most be glad you'd run off and acted so bad. But it
ain't reasonable; because, why didn't you tell me, child?
Why, you see, when you got to talking about the funeral, I just got all
full of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church, and I couldn't
somehow bear to spoil it. So I just put the bark back in my pocket and
kept mum.
What bark?
The bark I had wrote on to tell you we'd gone pirating. I wish, now,
you'd waked up when I kissed you--I do, honest.
The hard lines in his aunt's face relaxed and a sudden tenderness dawned
in her eyes.
_Did_ you kiss me, Tom?
Why, yes, I did.
Are you sure you did, Tom?
Why, yes, I did, auntie--certain sure.
What did you kiss me for, Tom?
Because I loved you so, and you laid there moaning and I was so sorry.
The words sounded like truth. The old lady could not hide a tremor in
her voice when she said:
Kiss me again, Tom!--and be off with you to school, now, and don't
bother me any more.
The moment he was gone, she ran to a closet and got out the ruin of a
jacket which Tom had gone pirating in. Then she stopped, with it in her
hand, and said to herself:
No, I don't dare. Poor boy, I reckon he's lied about it--but it's a
blessed, blessed lie, there's such a comfort come from it. I hope
the Lord--I _know_ the Lord will forgive him, because it was such
good-heartedness in him to tell it. But I don't want to find out it's a
lie. I won't look.
She put the jacket away, and stood by musing a minute. Twice she put out
her hand to take the garment again, and twice she refrained. Once more
she ventured, and this time she fortified herself with the thought:
It's a good lie--it's a good lie--I won't let it grieve me. So she
sought the jacket pocket. A moment later she was reading Tom's piece of
bark through flowing tears and saying: I could forgive the boy, now, if
he'd committed a million sins!
CHAPTER XX
THERE was something about Aunt Polly's manner, when she kissed Tom, that
swept away his low spirits and made him lighthearted and happy again. He
started to school and had the luck of coming upon Becky Thatcher at the
head of Meadow Lane. His mood always determined his manner. Without a
moment's hesitation he ran to her and said:
I acted mighty mean today, Becky, and I'm so sorry. I won't ever, ever
do that way again, as long as ever I live--please make up, won't you?
The girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face:
I'll thank you to keep yourself _to_ yourself, Mr. Thomas Sawyer. I'll
never speak to you again.
She tossed her head and passed on. Tom was so stunned that he had not
even presence of mind enough to say Who cares, Miss Smarty? until the
right time to say it had gone by. So he said nothing. But he was in a
fine rage, nevertheless. He moped into the schoolyard wishing she were
a boy, and imagining how he would trounce her if she were. He presently
encountered her and delivered a stinging remark as he passed. She hurled
one in return, and the angry breach was complete. It seemed to Becky, in
her hot resentment, that she could hardly wait for school to take in,
she was so impatient to see Tom flogged for the injured spelling-book.
If she had had any lingering notion of exposing Alfred Temple, Tom's
offensive fling had driven it entirely away.
Poor girl, she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble herself.
The master, Mr. Dobbins, had reached middle age with an unsatisfied
ambition. The darling of his desires was, to be a doctor, but
poverty had decreed that he should be nothing higher than a village
schoolmaster. Every day he took a mysterious book out of his desk and
absorbed himself in it at times when no classes were reciting. He kept
that book under lock and key. There was not an urchin in school but was
perishing to have a glimpse of it, but the chance never came. Every boy
and girl had a theory about the nature of that book; but no two theories
were alike, and there was no way of getting at the facts in the case.
Now, as Becky was passing by the desk, which stood near the door, she
noticed that the key was in the lock! It was a precious moment. She
glanced around; found herself alone, and the next instant she had the
book in her hands. The titlepage--Professor Somebody's _Anatomy_--carried
no information to her mind; so she began to turn the leaves. She came at
once upon a handsomely engraved and colored frontispiece--a human figure,
stark naked. At that moment a shadow fell on the page and Tom Sawyer
stepped in at the door and caught a glimpse of the picture. Becky
snatched at the book to close it, and had the hard luck to tear the
pictured page half down the middle. She thrust the volume into the desk,
turned the key, and burst out crying with shame and vexation.
Tom Sawyer, you are just as mean as you can be, to sneak up on a person
and look at what they're looking at.
How could I know you was looking at anything?
You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Tom Sawyer; you know you're
going to tell on me, and oh, what shall I do, what shall I do! I'll be
whipped, and I never was whipped in school.
Then she stamped her little foot and said:
_Be_ so mean if you want to! I know something that's going to happen.
You just wait and you'll see! Hateful, hateful, hateful!--and she flung
out of the house with a new explosion of crying.
Tom stood still, rather flustered by this onslaught. Presently he said
to himself:
What a curious kind of a fool a girl is! Never been licked in
school! Shucks! What's a licking! That's just like a girl--they're so
thin-skinned and chicken-hearted. Well, of course I ain't going to tell
old Dobbins on this little fool, because there's other ways of getting
even on her, that ain't so mean; but what of it? Old Dobbins will ask
who it was tore his book. Nobody'll answer. Then he'll do just the way
he always does--ask first one and then t'other, and when he comes to the
right girl he'll know it, without any telling. Girls' faces always tell
on them. They ain't got any backbone. She'll get licked. Well, it's a
kind of a tight place for Becky Thatcher, because there ain't any way
out of it. Tom conned the thing a moment longer, and then added: All
right, though; she'd like to see me in just such a fix--let her sweat it
out!
Tom joined the mob of skylarking scholars outside. In a few moments the
master arrived and school took in. Tom did not feel a strong interest
in his studies. Every time he stole a glance at the girls' side of the
room Becky's face troubled him. Considering all things, he did not want
to pity her, and yet it was all he could do to help it. He could get
up no exultation that was really worthy the name. Presently the
spelling-book discovery was made, and Tom's mind was entirely full
of his own matters for a while after that. Becky roused up from her
lethargy of distress and showed good interest in the proceedings. She
did not expect that Tom could get out of his trouble by denying that he
spilt the ink on the book himself; and she was right. The denial only
seemed to make the thing worse for Tom. Becky supposed she would be glad
of that, and she tried to believe she was glad of it, but she found she
was not certain. When the worst came to the worst, she had an impulse
to get up and tell on Alfred Temple, but she made an effort and forced
herself to keep still--because, said she to herself, he'll tell about me
tearing the picture sure. I wouldn't say a word, not to save his life!
Tom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all
broken-hearted, for he thought it was possible that he had unknowingly
upset the ink on the spelling-book himself, in some skylarking bout--he
had denied it for form's sake and because it was custom, and had stuck
to the denial from principle.
A whole hour drifted by, the master sat nodding in his throne, the air
was drowsy with the hum of study. By and by, Mr. Dobbins straightened
himself up, yawned, then unlocked his desk, and reached for his book,
but seemed undecided whether to take it out or leave it. Most of the
pupils glanced up languidly, but there were two among them that watched
his movements with intent eyes. Mr. Dobbins fingered his book absently
for a while, then took it out and settled himself in his chair to read!
Tom shot a glance at Becky. He had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit
look as she did, with a gun levelled at its head. Instantly he forgot
his quarrel with her. Quick--something must be done! done in a flash,
too! But the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention.
Good!--he had an inspiration! He would run and snatch the book, spring
through the door and fly. But his resolution shook for one little
instant, and the chance was lost--the master opened the volume. If Tom
only had the wasted opportunity back again! Too late. There was no help
for Becky now, he said. The next moment the master faced the school.
Every eye sank under his gaze. There was that in it which smote even
the innocent with fear. There was silence while one might count ten--the
master was gathering his wrath. Then he spoke: Who tore this book?
There was not a sound. One could have heard a pin drop. The stillness
continued; the master searched face after face for signs of guilt.
Benjamin Rogers, did you tear this book?
A denial. Another pause.
Joseph Harper, did you?
Another denial. Tom's uneasiness grew more and more intense under the
slow torture of these proceedings. The master scanned the ranks of
boys--considered a while, then turned to the girls:
Amy Lawrence?
A shake of the head.
Gracie Miller?
The same sign.
Susan Harper, did you do this?
Another negative. The next girl was Becky Thatcher. Tom was trembling
from head to foot with excitement and a sense of the hopelessness of the
situation.
Rebecca Thatcher [Tom glanced at her face--it was white with
terror]--did you tear--no, look me in the face [her hands rose in
appeal]--did you tear this book?
A thought shot like lightning through Tom's brain. He sprang to his feet
and shouted--I done it!
The school stared in perplexity at this incredible folly. Tom stood a
moment, to gather his dismembered faculties; and when he stepped forward
to go to his punishment the surprise, the gratitude, the adoration that
shone upon him out of poor Becky's eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred
floggings. Inspired by the splendor of his own act, he took without
an outcry the most merciless flaying that even Mr. Dobbins had ever
administered; and also received with indifference the added cruelty of a
command to remain two hours after school should be dismissed--for he
knew who would wait for him outside till his captivity was done, and not
count the tedious time as loss, either.
Tom went to bed that night planning vengeance against Alfred Temple; for
with shame and repentance Becky had told him all, not forgetting her own
treachery; but even the longing for vengeance had to give way, soon, to
pleasanter musings, and he fell asleep at last with Becky's latest words
lingering dreamily in his ear--
Tom, how _could_ you be so noble!
CHAPTER XXI
VACATION was approaching. The schoolmaster, always severe, grew severer
and more exacting than ever, for he wanted the school to make a good
showing on Examination day. His rod and his ferule were seldom idle
now--at least among the smaller pupils. Only the biggest boys, and young
ladies of eighteen and twenty, escaped lashing. Mr. Dobbins' lashings
were very vigorous ones, too; for although he carried, under his wig, a
perfectly bald and shiny head, he had only reached middle age, and there
was no sign of feebleness in his muscle. As the great day approached,
all the tyranny that was in him came to the surface; he seemed to take a
vindictive pleasure in punishing the least shortcomings. The consequence
was, that the smaller boys spent their days in terror and suffering and
their nights in plotting revenge. They threw away no opportunity to do
the master a mischief. But he kept ahead all the time. The retribution
that followed every vengeful success was so sweeping and majestic that
the boys always retired from the field badly worsted. At last they
conspired together and hit upon a plan that promised a dazzling victory.
They swore in the signpainter's boy, told him the scheme, and asked his
help. He had his own reasons for being delighted, for the master boarded
in his father's family and had given the boy ample cause to hate him.
The master's wife would go on a visit to the country in a few days, and
there would be nothing to interfere with the plan; the master always
prepared himself for great occasions by getting pretty well fuddled, and
the signpainter's boy said that when the dominie had reached the proper
condition on Examination Evening he would manage the thing while he
napped in his chair; then he would have him awakened at the right time
and hurried away to school.
In the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived. At eight in
the evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted, and adorned with
wreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers. The master sat throned in
his great chair upon a raised platform, with his blackboard behind him.
He was looking tolerably mellow. Three rows of benches on each side and
six rows in front of him were occupied by the dignitaries of the town
and by the parents of the pupils. To his left, back of the rows of
citizens, was a spacious temporary platform upon which were seated the
scholars who were to take part in the exercises of the evening; rows of
small boys, washed and dressed to an intolerable state of discomfort;
rows of gawky big boys; snowbanks of girls and young ladies clad in
lawn and muslin and conspicuously conscious of their bare arms, their
grandmothers' ancient trinkets, their bits of pink and blue ribbon and
the flowers in their hair. All the rest of the house was filled with
non-participating scholars.
The exercises began. A very little boy stood up and sheepishly recited,
You'd scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on the stage,
etc.--accompanying himself with the painfully exact and spasmodic
gestures which a machine might have used--supposing the machine to be a
trifle out of order. But he got through safely, though cruelly scared,
and got a fine round of applause when he made his manufactured bow and
retired.
A little shamefaced girl lisped, Mary had a little lamb, etc.,
performed a compassion-inspiring curtsy, got her meed of applause, and
sat down flushed and happy.
Tom Sawyer stepped forward with conceited confidence and soared into
the unquenchable and indestructible Give me liberty or give me death
speech, with fine fury and frantic gesticulation, and broke down in the
middle of it. A ghastly stage-fright seized him, his legs quaked under
him and he was like to choke. True, he had the manifest sympathy of the
house but he had the house's silence, too, which was even worse than
its sympathy. The master frowned, and this completed the disaster. Tom
struggled awhile and then retired, utterly defeated. There was a weak
attempt at applause, but it died early.
The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck followed; also The Assyrian Came
Down, and other declamatory gems. Then there were reading exercises,
and a spelling fight. The meagre Latin class recited with honor. The
prime feature of the evening was in order, now--original compositions
by the young ladies. Each in her turn stepped forward to the edge of the
platform, cleared her throat, held up her manuscript (tied with dainty
ribbon), and proceeded to read, with labored attention to expression
and punctuation. The themes were the same that had been illuminated upon
similar occasions by their mothers before them, their grandmothers,
and doubtless all their ancestors in the female line clear back to the
Crusades. Friendship was one; Memories of Other Days; Religion in
History; Dream Land; The Advantages of Culture; Forms of Political
Government Compared and Contrasted; Melancholy; Filial Love; Heart
Longings, etc., etc.
A prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted
melancholy; another was a wasteful and opulent gush of fine language;
another was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly prized words
and phrases until they were worn entirely out; and a peculiarity that
conspicuously marked and marred them was the inveterate and intolerable
sermon that wagged its crippled tail at the end of each and every one
of them. No matter what the subject might be, a brainracking effort was
made to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and religious
mind could contemplate with edification. The glaring insincerity of
these sermons was not sufficient to compass the banishment of the
fashion from the schools, and it is not sufficient today; it never will
be sufficient while the world stands, perhaps. There is no school in
all our land where the young ladies do not feel obliged to close their
compositions with a sermon; and you will find that the sermon of the
most frivolous and the least religious girl in the school is always
the longest and the most relentlessly pious. But enough of this. Homely
truth is unpalatable.
Let us return to the Examination. The first composition that was read
was one entitled Is this, then, Life? Perhaps the reader can endure an
extract from it:
In the common walks of life, with what delightful emotions does the
youthful mind look forward to some anticipated scene of festivity!
Imagination is busy sketching rose-tinted pictures of joy. In fancy, the
voluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid the festive throng, 'the
observed of all observers.' Her graceful form, arrayed in snowy robes,
is whirling through the mazes of the joyous dance; her eye is brightest,
her step is lightest in the gay assembly.
In such delicious fancies time quickly glides by, and the welcome hour
arrives for her entrance into the Elysian world, of which she has
had such bright dreams. How fairy-like does everything appear to her
enchanted vision! Each new scene is more charming than the last. But
after a while she finds that beneath this goodly exterior, all is
vanity, the flattery which once charmed her soul, now grates harshly
upon her ear; the ballroom has lost its charms; and with wasted health
and imbittered heart, she turns away with the conviction that earthly
pleasures cannot satisfy the longings of the soul!
And so forth and so on. There was a buzz of gratification from time to
time during the reading, accompanied by whispered ejaculations of How
sweet! How eloquent! So true! etc., and after the thing had closed
with a peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was enthusiastic.
Then arose a slim, melancholy girl, whose face had the interesting
paleness that comes of pills and indigestion, and read a poem. Two
stanzas of it will do:
A MISSOURI MAIDEN'S FAREWELL TO ALABAMA
Alabama, goodbye! I love thee well! But yet for a while do I leave thee
now! Sad, yes, sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell, And burning
recollections throng my brow! For I have wandered through thy flowery
woods; Have roamed and read near Tallapoosa's stream; Have listened to
Tallassee's warring floods, And wooed on Coosa's side Aurora's beam.
Yet shame I not to bear an o'erfull heart, Nor blush to turn behind
my tearful eyes; 'Tis from no stranger land I now must part, 'Tis to no
strangers left I yield these sighs. Welcome and home were mine within
this State, Whose vales I leave--whose spires fade fast from me And cold
must be mine eyes, and heart, and tete, When, dear Alabama! they turn
cold on thee! There were very few there who knew what tete meant, but
the poem was very satisfactory, nevertheless.
Next appeared a dark-complexioned, black-eyed, black-haired young lady,
who paused an impressive moment, assumed a tragic expression, and began
to read in a measured, solemn tone:
A VISION
Dark and tempestuous was night. Around the throne on high not a single
star quivered; but the deep intonations of the heavy thunder constantly
vibrated upon the ear; whilst the terrific lightning revelled in angry
mood through the cloudy chambers of heaven, seeming to scorn the power
exerted over its terror by the illustrious Franklin! Even the boisterous
winds unanimously came forth from their mystic homes, and blustered
about as if to enhance by their aid the wildness of the scene.
At such a time, so dark, so dreary, for human sympathy my very spirit
sighed; but instead thereof,
'My dearest friend, my counsellor, my comforter and guide--My joy in
grief, my second bliss in joy,' came to my side. She moved like one of
those bright beings pictured in the sunny walks of fancy's Eden by
the romantic and young, a queen of beauty unadorned save by her own
transcendent loveliness. So soft was her step, it failed to make even a
sound, and but for the magical thrill imparted by her genial touch,
as other unobtrusive beauties, she would have glided away
unperceived--unsought. A strange sadness rested upon her features, like
icy tears upon the robe of December, as she pointed to the contending
elements without, and bade me contemplate the two beings presented.
This nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound up with a
sermon so destructive of all hope to non-Presbyterians that it took
the first prize. This composition was considered to be the very finest
effort of the evening. The mayor of the village, in delivering the prize
to the author of it, made a warm speech in which he said that it was by
far the most eloquent thing he had ever listened to, and that Daniel
Webster himself might well be proud of it.
It may be remarked, in passing, that the number of compositions in which
the word beauteous was over-fondled, and human experience referred to
as life's page, was up to the usual average.
Now the master, mellow almost to the verge of geniality, put his chair
aside, turned his back to the audience, and began to draw a map of
America on the blackboard, to exercise the geography class upon. But he
made a sad business of it with his unsteady hand, and a smothered titter
rippled over the house. He knew what the matter was, and set himself to
right it. He sponged out lines and remade them; but he only distorted
them more than ever, and the tittering was more pronounced. He threw his
entire attention upon his work, now, as if determined not to be put down
by the mirth. He felt that all eyes were fastened upon him; he imagined
he was succeeding, and yet the tittering continued; it even manifestly
increased. And well it might. There was a garret above, pierced with
a scuttle over his head; and down through this scuttle came a cat,
suspended around the haunches by a string; she had a rag tied about
her head and jaws to keep her from mewing; as she slowly descended she
curved upward and clawed at the string, she swung downward and clawed
at the intangible air. The tittering rose higher and higher--the cat was
within six inches of the absorbed teacher's head--down, down, a little
lower, and she grabbed his wig with her desperate claws, clung to it,
and was snatched up into the garret in an instant with her trophy still
in her possession! And how the light did blaze abroad from the master's
bald pate--for the signpainter's boy had _gilded_ it!
That broke up the meeting. The boys were avenged. Vacation had come.
NOTE:--The pretended compositions quoted in this chapter are taken
without alteration from a volume entitled Prose and Poetry, by a
Western Lady--but they are exactly and precisely after the schoolgirl
pattern, and hence are much happier than any mere imitations could be.
CHAPTER XXII
TOM joined the new order of Cadets of Temperance, being attracted by the
showy character of their regalia. He promised to abstain from smoking,
chewing, and profanity as long as he remained a member. Now he found out
a new thing--namely, that to promise not to do a thing is the surest way
in the world to make a body want to go and do that very thing. Tom soon
found himself tormented with a desire to drink and swear; the desire
grew to be so intense that nothing but the hope of a chance to display
himself in his red sash kept him from withdrawing from the order. Fourth
of July was coming; but he soon gave that up--gave it up before he had
worn his shackles over forty-eight hours--and fixed his hopes upon old
Judge Frazer, justice of the peace, who was apparently on his deathbed
and would have a big public funeral, since he was so high an official.
During three days Tom was deeply concerned about the Judge's condition
and hungry for news of it. Sometimes his hopes ran high--so high that
he would venture to get out his regalia and practise before the
looking-glass. But the Judge had a most discouraging way of fluctuating.
At last he was pronounced upon the mend--and then convalescent. Tom was
disgusted; and felt a sense of injury, too. He handed in his resignation
at once--and that night the Judge suffered a relapse and died. Tom
resolved that he would never trust a man like that again.
The funeral was a fine thing. The Cadets paraded in a style calculated
to kill the late member with envy. Tom was a free boy again,
however--there was something in that. He could drink and swear, now--but
found to his surprise that he did not want to. The simple fact that he
could, took the desire away, and the charm of it.
Tom presently wondered to find that his coveted vacation was beginning
to hang a little heavily on his hands.
He attempted a diary--but nothing happened during three days, and so he
abandoned it.
The first of all the negro minstrel shows came to town, and made a
sensation. Tom and Joe Harper got up a band of performers and were happy
for two days.
Even the Glorious Fourth was in some sense a failure, for it rained
hard, there was no procession in consequence, and the greatest man
in the world (as Tom supposed), Mr. Benton, an actual United States
Senator, proved an overwhelming disappointment--for he was not
twenty-five feet high, nor even anywhere in the neighborhood of it.
A circus came. The boys played circus for three days afterward in tents
made of rag carpeting--admission, three pins for boys, two for girls--and
then circusing was abandoned.
A phrenologist and a mesmerizer came--and went again and left the village
duller and drearier than ever.
There were some boys-and-girls' parties, but they were so few and so
delightful that they only made the aching voids between ache the harder.
Becky Thatcher was gone to her Constantinople home to stay with her
parents during vacation--so there was no bright side to life anywhere.
The dreadful secret of the murder was a chronic misery. It was a very
cancer for permanency and pain.
Then came the measles.
During two long weeks Tom lay a prisoner, dead to the world and its
happenings. He was very ill, he was interested in nothing. When he got
upon his feet at last and moved feebly downtown, a melancholy change had
come over everything and every creature. There had been a revival, and
everybody had got religion, not only the adults, but even the boys and
girls. Tom went about, hoping against hope for the sight of one blessed
sinful face, but disappointment crossed him everywhere. He found Joe
Harper studying a Testament, and turned sadly away from the depressing
spectacle. He sought Ben Rogers, and found him visiting the poor with a
basket of tracts. He hunted up Jim Hollis, who called his attention to
the precious blessing of his late measles as a warning. Every boy
he encountered added another ton to his depression; and when, in
desperation, he flew for refuge at last to the bosom of Huckleberry Finn
and was received with a Scriptural quotation, his heart broke and he
crept home and to bed realizing that he alone of all the town was lost,
forever and forever.
And that night there came on a terrific storm, with driving rain, awful
claps of thunder and blinding sheets of lightning. He covered his head
with the bedclothes and waited in a horror of suspense for his doom; for
he had not the shadow of a doubt that all this hubbub was about him.
He believed he had taxed the forbearance of the powers above to the
extremity of endurance and that this was the result. It might have
seemed to him a waste of pomp and ammunition to kill a bug with a
battery of artillery, but there seemed nothing incongruous about the
getting up such an expensive thunderstorm as this to knock the turf from
under an insect like himself.
By and by the tempest spent itself and died without accomplishing its
object. The boy's first impulse was to be grateful, and reform. His
second was to wait--for there might not be any more storms.
The next day the doctors were back; Tom had relapsed. The three weeks he
spent on his back this time seemed an entire age. When he got abroad
at last he was hardly grateful that he had been spared, remembering how
lonely was his estate, how companionless and forlorn he was. He drifted
listlessly down the street and found Jim Hollis acting as judge in a
juvenile court that was trying a cat for murder, in the presence of her
victim, a bird. He found Joe Harper and Huck Finn up an alley eating a
stolen melon. Poor lads! they--like Tom--had suffered a relapse.
CHAPTER XXIII
AT last the sleepy atmosphere was stirred--and vigorously: the murder
trial came on in the court. It became the absorbing topic of village
talk immediately. Tom could not get away from it. Every reference to
the murder sent a shudder to his heart, for his troubled conscience
and fears almost persuaded him that these remarks were put forth in
his hearing as feelers; he did not see how he could be suspected of
knowing anything about the murder, but still he could not be comfortable
in the midst of this gossip. It kept him in a cold shiver all the time.
He took Huck to a lonely place to have a talk with him. It would be some
relief to unseal his tongue for a little while; to divide his burden of
distress with another sufferer. Moreover, he wanted to assure himself
that Huck had remained discreet.
Huck, have you ever told anybody about--that?
'Bout what?
You know what.
Oh--'course I haven't.
Never a word?
Never a solitary word, so help me. What makes you ask?
Well, I was afeard.
Why, Tom Sawyer, we wouldn't be alive two days if that got found out.
_You_ know that.
Tom felt more comfortable. After a pause:
Huck, they couldn't anybody get you to tell, could they?
Get me to tell? Why, if I wanted that halfbreed devil to drownd me they
could get me to tell. They ain't no different way.
Well, that's all right, then. I reckon we're safe as long as we keep
mum. But let's swear again, anyway. It's more surer.
I'm agreed.
So they swore again with dread solemnities.
What is the talk around, Huck? I've heard a power of it.
Talk? Well, it's just Muff Potter, Muff Potter, Muff Potter all the
time. It keeps me in a sweat, constant, so's I want to hide som'ers.
That's just the same way they go on round me. I reckon he's a goner.
Don't you feel sorry for him, sometimes?
Most always--most always. He ain't no account; but then he hain't ever
done anything to hurt anybody. Just fishes a little, to get money to
get drunk on--and loafs around considerable; but lord, we all do
that--leastways most of us--preachers and such like. But he's kind of
good--he give me half a fish, once, when there warn't enough for two; and
lots of times he's kind of stood by me when I was out of luck.
Well, he's mended kites for me, Huck, and knitted hooks on to my line.
I wish we could get him out of there.
My! we couldn't get him out, Tom. And besides, 'twouldn't do any good;
they'd ketch him again.
Yes--so they would. But I hate to hear 'em abuse him so like the dickens
when he never done--that.
I do too, Tom. Lord, I hear 'em say he's the bloodiest looking villain
in this country, and they wonder he wasn't ever hung before.
Yes, they talk like that, all the time. I've heard 'em say that if he
was to get free they'd lynch him.
And they'd do it, too.
The boys had a long talk, but it brought them little comfort. As the
twilight drew on, they found themselves hanging about the neighborhood
of the little isolated jail, perhaps with an undefined hope that
something would happen that might clear away their difficulties. But
nothing happened; there seemed to be no angels or fairies interested in
this luckless captive.
The boys did as they had often done before--went to the cell grating and
gave Potter some tobacco and matches. He was on the ground floor and
there were no guards.
His gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciences
before--it cut deeper than ever, this time. They felt cowardly and
treacherous to the last degree when Potter said:
You've been mighty good to me, boys--better'n anybody else in this town.
And I don't forget it, I don't. Often I says to myself, says I, 'I used
to mend all the boys' kites and things, and show 'em where the good
fishin' places was, and befriend 'em what I could, and now they've
all forgot old Muff when he's in trouble; but Tom don't, and Huck
don't--_they_ don't forget him, says I, 'and I don't forget them.' Well,
boys, I done an awful thing--drunk and crazy at the time--that's the only
way I account for it--and now I got to swing for it, and it's right.
Right, and _best_, too, I reckon--hope so, anyway. Well, we won't talk
about that. I don't want to make _you_ feel bad; you've befriended me.
But what I want to say, is, don't _you_ ever get drunk--then you won't
ever get here. Stand a litter furder west--so--that's it; it's a prime
comfort to see faces that's friendly when a body's in such a muck
of trouble, and there don't none come here but yourn. Good friendly
faces--good friendly faces. Git up on one another's backs and let me
touch 'em. That's it. Shake hands--yourn'll come through the bars, but
mine's too big. Little hands, and weak--but they've helped Muff Potter a
power, and they'd help him more if they could.
Tom went home miserable, and his dreams that night were full of horrors.
The next day and the day after, he hung about the courtroom, drawn by an
almost irresistible impulse to go in, but forcing himself to stay out.
Huck was having the same experience. They studiously avoided each other.
Each wandered away, from time to time, but the same dismal fascination
always brought them back presently. Tom kept his ears open when idlers
sauntered out of the courtroom, but invariably heard distressing
news--the toils were closing more and more relentlessly around poor
Potter. At the end of the second day the village talk was to the effect
that Injun Joe's evidence stood firm and unshaken, and that there was
not the slightest question as to what the jury's verdict would be.
Tom was out late, that night, and came to bed through the window. He
was in a tremendous state of excitement. It was hours before he got to
sleep. All the village flocked to the courthouse the next morning, for
this was to be the great day. Both sexes were about equally represented
in the packed audience. After a long wait the jury filed in and took
their places; shortly afterward, Potter, pale and haggard, timid and
hopeless, was brought in, with chains upon him, and seated where all
the curious eyes could stare at him; no less conspicuous was Injun Joe,
stolid as ever. There was another pause, and then the judge arrived and
the sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court. The usual whisperings
among the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed. These
details and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparation
that was as impressive as it was fascinating.
Now a witness was called who testified that he found Muff Potter washing
in the brook, at an early hour of the morning that the murder was
discovered, and that he immediately sneaked away. After some further
questioning, counsel for the prosecution said:
Take the witness.
The prisoner raised his eyes for a moment, but dropped them again when
his own counsel said:
I have no questions to ask him.
The next witness proved the finding of the knife near the corpse.
Counsel for the prosecution said:
Take the witness.
I have no questions to ask him, Potter's lawyer replied.
A third witness swore he had often seen the knife in Potter's
possession.
Take the witness.
Counsel for Potter declined to question him. The faces of the audience
began to betray annoyance. Did this attorney mean to throw away his
client's life without an effort?
Several witnesses deposed concerning Potter's guilty behavior when
brought to the scene of the murder. They were allowed to leave the stand
without being cross-questioned.
Every detail of the damaging circumstances that occurred in the
graveyard upon that morning which all present remembered so well was
brought out by credible witnesses, but none of them were cross-examined
by Potter's lawyer. The perplexity and dissatisfaction of the house
expressed itself in murmurs and provoked a reproof from the bench.
Counsel for the prosecution now said:
By the oaths of citizens whose simple word is above suspicion, we have
fastened this awful crime, beyond all possibility of question, upon the
unhappy prisoner at the bar. We rest our case here.
A groan escaped from poor Potter, and he put his face in his hands and
rocked his body softly to and fro, while a painful silence reigned
in the courtroom. Many men were moved, and many women's compassion
testified itself in tears. Counsel for the defence rose and said:
Your honor, in our remarks at the opening of this trial, we
foreshadowed our purpose to prove that our client did this fearful deed
while under the influence of a blind and irresponsible delirium produced
by drink. We have changed our mind. We shall not offer that plea. [Then
to the clerk:] Call Thomas Sawyer!
A puzzled amazement awoke in every face in the house, not even excepting
Potter's. Every eye fastened itself with wondering interest upon Tom as
he rose and took his place upon the stand. The boy looked wild enough,
for he was badly scared. The oath was administered.
Thomas Sawyer, where were you on the seventeenth of June, about the
hour of midnight?
Tom glanced at Injun Joe's iron face and his tongue failed him. The
audience listened breathless, but the words refused to come. After a few
moments, however, the boy got a little of his strength back, and managed
to put enough of it into his voice to make part of the house hear:
In the graveyard!
A little bit louder, please. Don't be afraid. You were--
In the graveyard.
A contemptuous smile flitted across Injun Joe's face.
Were you anywhere near Horse Williams' grave?
Yes, sir.
Speak up--just a trifle louder. How near were you?
Near as I am to you.
Were you hidden, or not?
I was hid.
Where?
Behind the elms that's on the edge of the grave.
Injun Joe gave a barely perceptible start.
Any one with you?
Yes, sir. I went there with--
Wait--wait a moment. Never mind mentioning your companion's name. We
will produce him at the proper time. Did you carry anything there with
you.
Tom hesitated and looked confused.
Speak out, my boy--don't be diffident. The truth is always respectable.
What did you take there?
Only a--a--dead cat.
There was a ripple of mirth, which the court checked.
We will produce the skeleton of that cat. Now, my boy, tell us
everything that occurred--tell it in your own way--don't skip anything,
and don't be afraid.
Tom began--hesitatingly at first, but as he warmed to his subject his
words flowed more and more easily; in a little while every sound ceased
but his own voice; every eye fixed itself upon him; with parted lips and
bated breath the audience hung upon his words, taking no note of time,
rapt in the ghastly fascinations of the tale. The strain upon pent
emotion reached its climax when the boy said:
--and as the doctor fetched the board around and Muff Potter fell, Injun
Joe jumped with the knife and--
Crash! Quick as lightning the halfbreed sprang for a window, tore his
way through all opposers, and was gone!
CHAPTER XXIV
TOM was a glittering hero once more--the pet of the old, the envy of the
young. His name even went into immortal print, for the village paper
magnified him. There were some that believed he would be President, yet,
if he escaped hanging.
As usual, the fickle, unreasoning world took Muff Potter to its bosom
and fondled him as lavishly as it had abused him before. But that sort
of conduct is to the world's credit; therefore it is not well to find
fault with it.
Tom's days were days of splendor and exultation to him, but his nights
were seasons of horror. Injun Joe infested all his dreams, and always
with doom in his eye. Hardly any temptation could persuade the boy
to stir abroad after nightfall. Poor Huck was in the same state of
wretchedness and terror, for Tom had told the whole story to the lawyer
the night before the great day of the trial, and Huck was sore afraid
that his share in the business might leak out, yet, notwithstanding
Injun Joe's flight had saved him the suffering of testifying in court.
The poor fellow had got the attorney to promise secrecy, but what of
that? Since Tom's harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the
lawyer's house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had
been sealed with the dismalest and most formidable of oaths, Huck's
confidence in the human race was wellnigh obliterated.
Daily Muff Potter's gratitude made Tom glad he had spoken; but nightly
he wished he had sealed up his tongue.
Half the time Tom was afraid Injun Joe would never be captured; the
other half he was afraid he would be. He felt sure he never could draw a
safe breath again until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse.
Rewards had been offered, the country had been scoured, but no Injun
Joe was found. One of those omniscient and aweinspiring marvels, a
detective, came up from St. Louis, moused around, shook his head, looked
wise, and made that sort of astounding success which members of that
craft usually achieve. That is to say, he found a clew. But you can't
hang a clew for murder, and so after that detective had got through
and gone home, Tom felt just as insecure as he was before.
The slow days drifted on, and each left behind it a slightly lightened
weight of apprehension.
CHAPTER XXV
THERE comes a time in every rightly-constructed boy's life when he has
a raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure. This desire
suddenly came upon Tom one day. He sallied out to find Joe Harper,
but failed of success. Next he sought Ben Rogers; he had gone fishing.
Presently he stumbled upon Huck Finn the Red-Handed. Huck would
answer. Tom took him to a private place and opened the matter to him
confidentially. Huck was willing. Huck was always willing to take a hand
in any enterprise that offered entertainment and required no capital,
for he had a troublesome superabundance of that sort of time which is
not money. Where'll we dig? said Huck.
Oh, most anywhere.
Why, is it hid all around?
No, indeed it ain't. It's hid in mighty particular places,
Huck--sometimes on islands, sometimes in rotten chests under the end of
a limb of an old dead tree, just where the shadow falls at midnight; but
mostly under the floor in ha'nted houses.
Who hides it?
Why, robbers, of course--who'd you reckon? Sunday-school
sup'rintendents?
I don't know. If 'twas mine I wouldn't hide it; I'd spend it and have a
good time.
So would I. But robbers don't do that way. They always hide it and
leave it there.
Don't they come after it any more?
No, they think they will, but they generally forget the marks, or else
they die. Anyway, it lays there a long time and gets rusty; and by and
by somebody finds an old yellow paper that tells how to find the marks--a
paper that's got to be ciphered over about a week because it's mostly
signs and hy'roglyphics.
Hyro--which?
Hy'roglyphics--pictures and things, you know, that don't seem to mean
anything.
Have you got one of them papers, Tom?
No.
Well then, how you going to find the marks?
I don't want any marks. They always bury it under a ha'nted house or on
an island, or under a dead tree that's got one limb sticking out. Well,
we've tried Jackson's Island a little, and we can try it again some
time; and there's the old ha'nted house up the Still-House branch, and
there's lots of dead-limb trees--dead loads of 'em.
Is it under all of them?
How you talk! No!
Then how you going to know which one to go for?
Go for all of 'em!
Why, Tom, it'll take all summer.
Well, what of that? Suppose you find a brass pot with a hundred dollars
in it, all rusty and gray, or rotten chest full of di'monds. How's
that?
Huck's eyes glowed.
That's bully. Plenty bully enough for me. Just you gimme the hundred
dollars and I don't want no di'monds.
All right. But I bet you I ain't going to throw off on di'monds. Some
of 'em's worth twenty dollars apiece--there ain't any, hardly, but's
worth six bits or a dollar.
No! Is that so?
Cert'nly--anybody'll tell you so. Hain't you ever seen one, Huck?
Not as I remember.
Oh, kings have slathers of them.
Well, I don' know no kings, Tom.
I reckon you don't. But if you was to go to Europe you'd see a raft of
'em hopping around.
Do they hop?
Hop?--your granny! No!
Well, what did you say they did, for?
Shucks, I only meant you'd _see_ 'em--not hopping, of course--what do
they want to hop for?--but I mean you'd just see 'em--scattered around,
you know, in a kind of a general way. Like that old humpbacked Richard.
Richard? What's his other name?
He didn't have any other name. Kings don't have any but a given name.
No?
But they don't.
Well, if they like it, Tom, all right; but I don't want to be a king
and have only just a given name, like a nigger. But say--where you going
to dig first?
Well, I don't know. S'pose we tackle that old dead-limb tree on the
hill t'other side of Still-House branch?
I'm agreed.
So they got a crippled pick and a shovel, and set out on their
three-mile tramp. They arrived hot and panting, and threw themselves
down in the shade of a neighboring elm to rest and have a smoke.
I like this, said Tom.
So do I.
Say, Huck, if we find a treasure here, what you going to do with your
share?
Well, I'll have pie and a glass of soda every day, and I'll go to every
circus that comes along. I bet I'll have a gay time.
Well, ain't you going to save any of it?
Save it? What for?
Why, so as to have something to live on, by and by.
Oh, that ain't any use. Pap would come back to thish-yer town some day
and get his claws on it if I didn't hurry up, and I tell you he'd clean
it out pretty quick. What you going to do with yourn, Tom?
I'm going to buy a new drum, and a sure'nough sword, and a red necktie
and a bull pup, and get married.
Married!
That's it.
Tom, you--why, you ain't in your right mind.
Wait--you'll see.
Well, that's the foolishest thing you could do. Look at pap and my
mother. Fight! Why, they used to fight all the time. I remember, mighty
well.
That ain't anything. The girl I'm going to marry won't fight.
Tom, I reckon they're all alike. They'll all comb a body. Now you
better think 'bout this awhile. I tell you you better. What's the name
of the gal?
It ain't a gal at all--it's a girl.
It's all the same, I reckon; some says gal, some says girl--both's
right, like enough. Anyway, what's her name, Tom?
I'll tell you some time--not now.
All right--that'll do. Only if you get married I'll be more lonesomer
than ever.
No you won't. You'll come and live with me. Now stir out of this and
we'll go to digging.
They worked and sweated for half an hour. No result. They toiled another
halfhour. Still no result. Huck said:
Do they always bury it as deep as this?
Sometimes--not always. Not generally. I reckon we haven't got the right
place.
So they chose a new spot and began again. The labor dragged a little,
but still they made progress. They pegged away in silence for some time.
Finally Huck leaned on his shovel, swabbed the beaded drops from his
brow with his sleeve, and said:
Where you going to dig next, after we get this one?
I reckon maybe we'll tackle the old tree that's over yonder on Cardiff
Hill back of the widow's.
I reckon that'll be a good one. But won't the widow take it away from
us, Tom? It's on her land.
_She_ take it away! Maybe she'd like to try it once. Whoever finds one
of these hid treasures, it belongs to him. It don't make any difference
whose land it's on.
That was satisfactory. The work went on. By and by Huck said:
Blame it, we must be in the wrong place again. What do you think?
It is mighty curious, Huck. I don't understand it. Sometimes witches
interfere. I reckon maybe that's what's the trouble now.
Shucks! Witches ain't got no power in the daytime.
Well, that's so. I didn't think of that. Oh, I know what the matter is!
What a blamed lot of fools we are! You got to find out where the shadow
of the limb falls at midnight, and that's where you dig!
Then consound it, we've fooled away all this work for nothing. Now hang
it all, we got to come back in the night. It's an awful long way. Can
you get out?
I bet I will. We've got to do it tonight, too, because if somebody sees
these holes they'll know in a minute what's here and they'll go for it.
Well, I'll come around and maow tonight.
All right. Let's hide the tools in the bushes.
The boys were there that night, about the appointed time. They sat in
the shadow waiting. It was a lonely place, and an hour made solemn by
old traditions. Spirits whispered in the rustling leaves, ghosts lurked
in the murky nooks, the deep baying of a hound floated up out of the
distance, an owl answered with his sepulchral note. The boys were
subdued by these solemnities, and talked little. By and by they judged
that twelve had come; they marked where the shadow fell, and began to
dig. Their hopes commenced to rise. Their interest grew stronger, and
their industry kept pace with it. The hole deepened and still deepened,
but every time their hearts jumped to hear the pick strike upon
something, they only suffered a new disappointment. It was only a stone
or a chunk. At last Tom said:
It ain't any use, Huck, we're wrong again.
Well, but we _can't_ be wrong. We spotted the shadder to a dot.
I know it, but then there's another thing.
What's that?.
Why, we only guessed at the time. Like enough it was too late or too
early.
Huck dropped his shovel.
That's it, said he. That's the very trouble. We got to give this one
up. We can't ever tell the right time, and besides this kind of thing's
too awful, here this time of night with witches and ghosts a-fluttering
around so. I feel as if something's behind me all the time;  and I'm
afeard to turn around, becuz maybe there's others in front a-waiting for
a chance. I been creeping all over, ever since I got here.
Well, I've been pretty much so, too, Huck. They most always put in a
dead man when they bury a treasure under a tree, to look out for it.
Lordy!
Yes, they do. I've always heard that.
Tom, I don't like to fool around much where there's dead people. A
body's bound to get into trouble with 'em, sure.
I don't like to stir 'em up, either. S'pose this one here was to stick
his skull out and say something!
Don't Tom! It's awful.
Well, it just is. Huck, I don't feel comfortable a bit.
Say, Tom, let's give this place up, and try somewheres else.
All right, I reckon we better.
What'll it be?
Tom considered awhile; and then said:
The ha'nted house. That's it!
Blame it, I don't like ha'nted houses, Tom. Why, they're a dern sight
worse'n dead people. Dead people might talk, maybe, but they don't come
sliding around in a shroud, when you ain't noticing, and peep over your
shoulder all of a sudden and grit their teeth, the way a ghost does. I
couldn't stand such a thing as that, Tom--nobody could.
Yes, but, Huck, ghosts don't travel around only at night. They won't
hender us from digging there in the daytime.
Well, that's so. But you know mighty well people don't go about that
ha'nted house in the day nor the night.
Well, that's mostly because they don't like to go where a man's been
murdered, anyway--but nothing's ever been seen around that house except
in the night--just some blue lights slipping by the windows--no regular
ghosts.
Well, where you see one of them blue lights flickering around, Tom,
you can bet there's a ghost mighty close behind it. It stands to reason.
Becuz you know that they don't anybody but ghosts use 'em.
Yes, that's so. But anyway they don't come around in the daytime, so
what's the use of our being afeard?
Well, all right. We'll tackle the ha'nted house if you say so--but I
reckon it's taking chances.
They had started down the hill by this time. There in the middle of the
moonlit valley below them stood the ha'nted house, utterly isolated,
its fences gone long ago, rank weeds smothering the very doorsteps, the
chimney crumbled to ruin, the window-sashes vacant, a corner of the roof
caved in. The boys gazed awhile, half expecting to see a blue light flit
past a window; then talking in a low tone, as befitted the time and the
circumstances, they struck far off to the right, to give the haunted
house a wide berth, and took their way homeward through the woods that
adorned the rearward side of Cardiff Hill.
CHAPTER XVI
ABOUT noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead tree; they had come
for their tools. Tom was impatient to go to the haunted house; Huck was
measurably so, also--but suddenly said:
Lookyhere, Tom, do you know what day it is?
Tom mentally ran over the days of the week, and then quickly lifted his
eyes with a startled look in them--
My! I never once thought of it, Huck!
Well, I didn't neither, but all at once it popped onto me that it was
Friday.
Blame it, a body can't be too careful, Huck. We might 'a' got into an
awful scrape, tackling such a thing on a Friday.
_Might_! Better say we _would_! There's some lucky days, maybe, but
Friday ain't.
Any fool knows that. I don't reckon _you_ was the first that found it
out, Huck.
Well, I never said I was, did I? And Friday ain't all, neither. I had a
rotten bad dream last night--dreampt about rats.
No! Sure sign of trouble. Did they fight?
No.
Well, that's good, Huck. When they don't fight it's only a sign that
there's trouble around, you know. All we got to do is to look mighty
sharp and keep out of it. We'll drop this thing for today, and play. Do
you know Robin Hood, Huck?
No. Who's Robin Hood?
Why, he was one of the greatest men that was ever in England--and the
best. He was a robber.
Cracky, I wisht I was. Who did he rob?
Only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings, and such like. But
he never bothered the poor. He loved 'em. He always divided up with 'em
perfectly square.
Well, he must 'a' been a brick.
I bet you he was, Huck. Oh, he was the noblest man that ever was.
They ain't any such men now, I can tell you. He could lick any man in
England, with one hand tied behind him; and he could take his yew bow
and plug a ten-cent piece every time, a mile and a half.
What's a _yew_ bow?
I don't know. It's some kind of a bow, of course. And if he hit that
dime only on the edge he would set down and cry--and curse. But we'll
play Robin Hood--it's nobby fun. I'll learn you.
I'm agreed.
So they played Robin Hood all the afternoon, now and then casting a
yearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a remark about the
morrow's prospects and possibilities there. As the sun began to sink
into the west they took their way homeward athwart the long shadows
of the trees and soon were buried from sight in the forests of Cardiff
Hill.
On Saturday, shortly after noon, the boys were at the dead tree again.
They had a smoke and a chat in the shade, and then dug a little in their
last hole, not with great hope, but merely because Tom said there were
so many cases where people had given up a treasure after getting down
within six inches of it, and then somebody else had come along and
turned it up with a single thrust of a shovel. The thing failed this
time, however, so the boys shouldered their tools and went away feeling
that they had not trifled with fortune, but had fulfilled all the
requirements that belong to the business of treasure-hunting.
When they reached the haunted house there was something so weird and
grisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking sun,
and something so depressing about the loneliness and desolation of the
place, that they were afraid, for a moment, to venture in. Then they
crept to the door and took a trembling peep. They saw a weedgrown,
floorless room, unplastered, an ancient fireplace, vacant windows,
a ruinous staircase; and here, there, and everywhere hung ragged and
abandoned cobwebs. They presently entered, softly, with quickened
pulses, talking in whispers, ears alert to catch the slightest sound,
and muscles tense and ready for instant retreat.
In a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave the
place a critical and interested examination, rather admiring their own
boldness, and wondering at it, too. Next they wanted to look upstairs.
This was something like cutting off retreat, but they got to daring
each other, and of course there could be but one result--they threw their
tools into a corner and made the ascent. Up there were the same signs of
decay. In one corner they found a closet that promised mystery, but the
promise was a fraud--there was nothing in it. Their courage was up now
and well in hand. They were about to go down and begin work when--
Sh! said Tom.
What is it? whispered Huck, blanching with fright.
Sh!... There!... Hear it?
Yes!... Oh, my! Let's run!
Keep still! Don't you budge! They're coming right toward the door.
The boys stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes to
knotholes in the planking, and lay waiting, in a misery of fear.
They've stopped.... No--coming.... Here they are. Don't whisper another
word, Huck. My goodness, I wish I was out of this!
Two men entered. Each boy said to himself: There's the old deaf and
dumb Spaniard that's been about town once or twice lately--never saw
t'other man before.
T'other was a ragged, unkempt creature, with nothing very pleasant
in his face. The Spaniard was wrapped in a serape; he had bushy white
whiskers; long white hair flowed from under his sombrero, and he wore
green goggles. When they came in, t'other was talking in a low voice;
they sat down on the ground, facing the door, with their backs to the
wall, and the speaker continued his remarks. His manner became less
guarded and his words more distinct as he proceeded:
No, said he, I've thought it all over, and I don't like it. It's
dangerous.
Dangerous! grunted the deaf and dumb Spaniard--to the vast surprise
of the boys. Milksop!
This voice made the boys gasp and quake. It was Injun Joe's! There was
silence for some time. Then Joe said:
What's any more dangerous than that job up yonder--but nothing's come of
it.
That's different. Away up the river so, and not another house about.
'Twon't ever be known that we tried, anyway, long as we didn't succeed.
Well, what's more dangerous than coming here in the daytime!--anybody
would suspicion us that saw us.
I know that. But there warn't any other place as handy after that fool
of a job. I want to quit this shanty. I wanted to yesterday, only it
warn't any use trying to stir out of here, with those infernal boys
playing over there on the hill right in full view.
Those infernal boys quaked again under the inspiration of this remark,
and thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it was Friday and
concluded to wait a day. They wished in their hearts they had waited a
year.
The two men got out some food and made a luncheon. After a long and
thoughtful silence, Injun Joe said:
Look here, lad--you go back up the river where you belong. Wait there
till you hear from me. I'll take the chances on dropping into this town
just once more, for a look. We'll do that 'dangerous' job after I've
spied around a little and think things look well for it. Then for Texas!
We'll leg it together!
This was satisfactory. Both men presently fell to yawning, and Injun Joe
said:
I'm dead for sleep! It's your turn to watch.
He curled down in the weeds and soon began to snore. His comrade stirred
him once or twice and he became quiet. Presently the watcher began to
nod; his head drooped lower and lower, both men began to snore now.
The boys drew a long, grateful breath. Tom whispered:
Now's our chance--come!
Huck said:
I can't--I'd die if they was to wake.
Tom urged--Huck held back. At last Tom rose slowly and softly, and
started alone. But the first step he made wrung such a hideous creak
from the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead with fright. He never
made a second attempt. The boys lay there counting the dragging moments
till it seemed to them that time must be done and eternity growing gray;
and then they were grateful to note that at last the sun was setting.
Now one snore ceased. Injun Joe sat up, stared around--smiled grimly upon
his comrade, whose head was drooping upon his knees--stirred him up with
his foot and said:
Here! _You're_ a watchman, ain't you! All right, though--nothing's
happened.
My! have I been asleep?
Oh, partly, partly. Nearly time for us to be moving, pard. What'll we
do with what little swag we've got left?
I don't know--leave it here as we've always done, I reckon. No use to
take it away till we start south. Six hundred and fifty in silver's
something to carry.
Well--all right--it won't matter to come here once more.
No--but I'd say come in the night as we used to do--it's better.
Yes: but look here; it may be a good while before I get the right
chance at that job; accidents might happen; 'tain't in such a very good
place; we'll just regularly bury it--and bury it deep.
Good idea, said the comrade, who walked across the room, knelt down,
raised one of the rearward hearth-stones and took out a bag that jingled
pleasantly. He subtracted from it twenty or thirty dollars for himself
and as much for Injun Joe, and passed the bag to the latter, who was on
his knees in the corner, now, digging with his bowie-knife.
The boys forgot all their fears, all their miseries in an instant. With
gloating eyes they watched every movement. Luck!--the splendor of it was
beyond all imagination! Six hundred dollars was money enough to make
half a dozen boys rich! Here was treasure-hunting under the happiest
auspices--there would not be any bothersome uncertainty as to where to
dig. They nudged each other every moment--eloquent nudges and easily
understood, for they simply meant--Oh, but ain't you glad _now_ we're
here!
Joe's knife struck upon something.
Hello! said he.
What is it? said his comrade.
Half-rotten plank--no, it's a box, I believe. Here--bear a hand and we'll
see what it's here for. Never mind, I've broke a hole.
He reached his hand in and drew it out--
Man, it's money!
The two men examined the handful of coins. They were gold. The boys
above were as excited as themselves, and as delighted.
Joe's comrade said:
We'll make quick work of this. There's an old rusty pick over amongst
the weeds in the corner the other side of the fireplace--I saw it a
minute ago.
He ran and brought the boys' pick and shovel. Injun Joe took the
pick, looked it over critically, shook his head, muttered something to
himself, and then began to use it. The box was soon unearthed. It was
not very large; it was iron bound and had been very strong before the
slow years had injured it. The men contemplated the treasure awhile in
blissful silence.
Pard, there's thousands of dollars here, said Injun Joe.
'Twas always said that Murrel's gang used to be around here one
summer, the stranger observed.
I know it, said Injun Joe; and this looks like it, I should say.
Now you won't need to do that job.
The halfbreed frowned. Said he:
You don't know me. Least you don't know all about that thing. 'Tain't
robbery altogether--it's _revenge_! and a wicked light flamed in his
eyes. I'll need your help in it. When it's finished--then Texas. Go home
to your Nance and your kids, and stand by till you hear from me.
Well--if you say so; what'll we do with this--bury it again?
Yes. [Ravishing delight overhead.] _No_! by the great Sachem, no!
[Profound distress overhead.] I'd nearly forgot. That pick had fresh
earth on it! [The boys were sick with terror in a moment.] What business
has a pick and a shovel here? What business with fresh earth on
them? Who brought them here--and where are they gone? Have you heard
anybody?--seen anybody? What! bury it again and leave them to come and
see the ground disturbed? Not exactly--not exactly. We'll take it to my
den.
Why, of course! Might have thought of that before. You mean Number
One?
No--Number Two--under the cross. The other place is bad--too common.
All right. It's nearly dark enough to start.
Injun Joe got up and went about from window to window cautiously peeping
out. Presently he said:
Who could have brought those tools here? Do you reckon they can be
upstairs?
The boys' breath forsook them. Injun Joe put his hand on his knife,
halted a moment, undecided, and then turned toward the stairway. The
boys thought of the closet, but their strength was gone. The steps came
creaking up the stairs--the intolerable distress of the situation woke
the stricken resolution of the lads--they were about to spring for the
closet, when there was a crash of rotten timbers and Injun Joe landed on
the ground amid the debris of the ruined stairway. He gathered himself
up cursing, and his comrade said:
Now what's the use of all that? If it's anybody, and they're up there,
let them _stay_ there--who cares? If they want to jump down, now, and get
into trouble, who objects? It will be dark in fifteen minutes--and then
let them follow us if they want to. I'm willing. In my opinion, whoever
hove those things in here caught a sight of us and took us for ghosts or
devils or something. I'll bet they're running yet.
Joe grumbled awhile; then he agreed with his friend that what daylight
was left ought to be economized in getting things ready for leaving.
Shortly afterward they slipped out of the house in the deepening
twilight, and moved toward the river with their precious box.
Tom and Huck rose up, weak but vastly relieved, and stared after them
through the chinks between the logs of the house. Follow? Not they. They
were content to reach ground again without broken necks, and take the
townward track over the hill. They did not talk much. They were too much
absorbed in hating themselves--hating the ill luck that made them take
the spade and the pick there. But for that, Injun Joe never would have
suspected. He would have hidden the silver with the gold to wait
there till his revenge was satisfied, and then he would have had the
misfortune to find that money turn up missing. Bitter, bitter luck that
the tools were ever brought there!
They resolved to keep a lookout for that Spaniard when he should come to
town spying out for chances to do his revengeful job, and follow him to
Number Two, wherever that might be. Then a ghastly thought occurred to
Tom.
Revenge? What if he means _us_, Huck!
Oh, don't! said Huck, nearly fainting.
They talked it all over, and as they entered town they agreed to believe
that he might possibly mean somebody else--at least that he might at
least mean nobody but Tom, since only Tom had testified.
Very, very small comfort it was to Tom to be alone in danger! Company
would be a palpable improvement, he thought.
CHAPTER XXVII
THE adventure of the day mightily tormented Tom's dreams that night.
Four times he had his hands on that rich treasure and four times
it wasted to nothingness in his fingers as sleep forsook him and
wakefulness brought back the hard reality of his misfortune. As he lay
in the early morning recalling the incidents of his great adventure, he
noticed that they seemed curiously subdued and far away--somewhat as if
they had happened in another world, or in a time long gone by. Then it
occurred to him that the great adventure itself must be a dream! There
was one very strong argument in favor of this idea--namely, that the
quantity of coin he had seen was too vast to be real. He had never seen
as much as fifty dollars in one mass before, and he was like all boys of
his age and station in life, in that he imagined that all references to
hundreds and thousands were mere fanciful forms of speech, and that
no such sums really existed in the world. He never had supposed for
a moment that so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be found in
actual money in any one's possession. If his notions of hidden treasure
had been analyzed, they would have been found to consist of a handful of
real dimes and a bushel of vague, splendid, ungraspable dollars.
But the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and clearer
under the attrition of thinking them over, and so he presently found
himself leaning to the impression that the thing might not have been a
dream, after all. This uncertainty must be swept away. He would snatch a
hurried breakfast and go and find Huck. Huck was sitting on the gunwale
of a flatboat, listlessly dangling his feet in the water and looking
very melancholy. Tom concluded to let Huck lead up to the subject. If
he did not do it, then the adventure would be proved to have been only a
dream.
Hello, Huck!
Hello, yourself.
Silence, for a minute.
Tom, if we'd 'a' left the blame tools at the dead tree, we'd 'a' got
the money. Oh, ain't it awful!
'Tain't a dream, then, 'tain't a dream! Somehow I most wish it was.
Dog'd if I don't, Huck.
What ain't a dream?
Oh, that thing yesterday. I been half thinking it was.
Dream! If them stairs hadn't broke down you'd 'a' seen how much dream
it was! I've had dreams enough all night--with that patch-eyed Spanish
devil going for me all through 'em--rot him!
No, not rot him. _Find_ him! Track the money!
Tom, we'll never find him. A feller don't have only one chance for such
a pile--and that one's lost. I'd feel mighty shaky if I was to see him,
anyway.
Well, so'd I; but I'd like to see him, anyway--and track him out--to his
Number Two.
Number Two--yes, that's it. I been thinking 'bout that. But I can't make
nothing out of it. What do you reckon it is?
I dono. It's too deep. Say, Huck--maybe it's the number of a house!
Goody!... No, Tom, that ain't it. If it is, it ain't in this one-horse
town. They ain't no numbers here.
Well, that's so. Lemme think a minute. Here--it's the number of a
room--in a tavern, you know!
Oh, that's the trick! They ain't only two taverns. We can find out
quick.
You stay here, Huck, till I come.
Tom was off at once. He did not care to have Huck's company in public
places. He was gone half an hour. He found that in the best tavern, No.
2 had long been occupied by a young lawyer, and was still so occupied.
In the less ostentatious house, No. 2 was a mystery. The tavern-keeper's
young son said it was kept locked all the time, and he never saw anybody
go into it or come out of it except at night; he did not know any
particular reason for this state of things; had had some little
curiosity, but it was rather feeble; had made the most of the mystery
by entertaining himself with the idea that that room was ha'nted; had
noticed that there was a light in there the night before.
That's what I've found out, Huck. I reckon that's the very No. 2 we're
after.
I reckon it is, Tom. Now what you going to do?
Lemme think.
Tom thought a long time. Then he said:
I'll tell you. The back door of that No. 2 is the door that comes out
into that little close alley between the tavern and the old rattle trap
of a brick store. Now you get hold of all the doorkeys you can find, and
I'll nip all of auntie's, and the first dark night we'll go there and
try 'em. And mind you, keep a lookout for Injun Joe, because he said he
was going to drop into town and spy around once more for a chance to get
his revenge. If you see him, you just follow him; and if he don't go to
that No. 2, that ain't the place.
Lordy, I don't want to foller him by myself!
Why, it'll be night, sure. He mightn't ever see you--and if he did,
maybe he'd never think anything.
Well, if it's pretty dark I reckon I'll track him. I dono--I dono. I'll
try.
You bet I'll follow him, if it's dark, Huck. Why, he might 'a' found
out he couldn't get his revenge, and be going right after that money.
It's so, Tom, it's so. I'll foller him; I will, by jingoes!
Now you're _talking_! Don't you ever weaken, Huck, and I won't.
CHAPTER XXVIII
THAT night Tom and Huck were ready for their adventure. They hung about
the neighborhood of the tavern until after nine, one watching the alley
at a distance and the other the tavern door. Nobody entered the alley or
left it; nobody resembling the Spaniard entered or left the tavern
door. The night promised to be a fair one; so Tom went home with the
understanding that if a considerable degree of darkness came on, Huck
was to come and maow, whereupon he would slip out and try the keys.
But the night remained clear, and Huck closed his watch and retired to
bed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelve.
Tuesday the boys had the same ill luck. Also Wednesday. But Thursday
night promised better. Tom slipped out in good season with his aunt's
old tin lantern, and a large towel to blindfold it with. He hid the
lantern in Huck's sugar hogshead and the watch began. An hour before
midnight the tavern closed up and its lights (the only ones thereabouts)
were put out. No Spaniard had been seen. Nobody had entered or left the
alley. Everything was auspicious. The blackness of darkness reigned,
the perfect stillness was interrupted only by occasional mutterings of
distant thunder.
Tom got his lantern, lit it in the hogshead, wrapped it closely in the
towel, and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern.
Huck stood sentry and Tom felt his way into the alley. Then there was
a season of waiting anxiety that weighed upon Huck's spirits like a
mountain. He began to wish he could see a flash from the lantern--it
would frighten him, but it would at least tell him that Tom was alive
yet. It seemed hours since Tom had disappeared. Surely he must have
fainted; maybe he was dead; maybe his heart had burst under terror and
excitement. In his uneasiness Huck found himself drawing closer
and closer to the alley; fearing all sorts of dreadful things, and
momentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that would take away
his breath. There was not much to take away, for he seemed only able to
inhale it by thimblefuls, and his heart would soon wear itself out, the
way it was beating. Suddenly there was a flash of light and Tom came
tearing by him: Run! said he; run, for your life!
He needn't have repeated it; once was enough; Huck was making thirty or
forty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered. The boys never
stopped till they reached the shed of a deserted slaughter-house at the
lower end of the village. Just as they got within its shelter the storm
burst and the rain poured down. As soon as Tom got his breath he said:
Huck, it was awful! I tried two of the keys, just as soft as I could;
but they seemed to make such a power of racket that I couldn't hardly
get my breath I was so scared. They wouldn't turn in the lock, either.
Well, without noticing what I was doing, I took hold of the knob, and
open comes the door! It warn't locked! I hopped in, and shook off the
towel, and, _Great Caesar's Ghost!_
What!--what'd you see, Tom?
Huck, I most stepped onto Injun Joe's hand!
No!
Yes! He was lying there, sound asleep on the floor, with his old patch
on his eye and his arms spread out.
Lordy, what did you do? Did he wake up?
No, never budged. Drunk, I reckon. I just grabbed that towel and
started!
I'd never 'a' thought of the towel, I bet!
Well, I would. My aunt would make me mighty sick if I lost it.
Say, Tom, did you see that box?
Huck, I didn't wait to look around. I didn't see the box, I didn't see
the cross. I didn't see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the floor
by Injun Joe; yes, I saw two barrels and lots more bottles in the room.
Don't you see, now, what's the matter with that ha'nted room?
How?
Why, it's ha'nted with whiskey! Maybe _all_ the Temperance Taverns have
got a ha'nted room, hey, Huck?
Well, I reckon maybe that's so. Who'd 'a' thought such a thing? But
say, Tom, now's a mighty good time to get that box, if Injun Joe's
drunk.
It is, that! You try it!
Huck shuddered.
Well, no--I reckon not.
And I reckon not, Huck. Only one bottle alongside of Injun Joe ain't
enough. If there'd been three, he'd be drunk enough and I'd do it.
There was a long pause for reflection, and then Tom said:
Lookyhere, Huck, less not try that thing any more till we know Injun
Joe's not in there. It's too scary. Now, if we watch every night, we'll
be dead sure to see him go out, some time or other, and then we'll
snatch that box quicker'n lightning.
Well, I'm agreed. I'll watch the whole night long, and I'll do it every
night, too, if you'll do the other part of the job.
All right, I will. All you got to do is to trot up Hooper Street a
block and maow--and if I'm asleep, you throw some gravel at the window
and that'll fetch me.
Agreed, and good as wheat!
Now, Huck, the storm's over, and I'll go home. It'll begin to be
daylight in a couple of hours. You go back and watch that long, will
you?
I said I would, Tom, and I will. I'll ha'nt that tavern every night for
a year! I'll sleep all day and I'll stand watch all night.
That's all right. Now, where you going to sleep?
In Ben Rogers' hayloft. He lets me, and so does his pap's nigger man,
Uncle Jake. I tote water for Uncle Jake whenever he wants me to, and any
time I ask him he gives me a little something to eat if he can spare it.
That's a mighty good nigger, Tom. He likes me, becuz I don't ever act as
if I was above him. Sometime I've set right down and eat _with_ him. But
you needn't tell that. A body's got to do things when he's awful hungry
he wouldn't want to do as a steady thing.
Well, if I don't want you in the daytime, I'll let you sleep. I won't
come bothering around. Any time you see something's up, in the night,
just skip right around and maow.
CHAPTER XXIX
THE first thing Tom heard on Friday morning was a glad piece of
news--Judge Thatcher's family had come back to town the night before.
Both Injun Joe and the treasure sunk into secondary importance for a
moment, and Becky took the chief place in the boy's interest. He saw her
and they had an exhausting good time playing hispy and gully-keeper
with a crowd of their schoolmates. The day was completed and crowned in
a peculiarly satisfactory way: Becky teased her mother to appoint
the next day for the long-promised and long-delayed picnic, and she
consented. The child's delight was boundless; and Tom's not more
moderate. The invitations were sent out before sunset, and straightway
the young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation
and pleasurable anticipation. Tom's excitement enabled him to keep
awake until a pretty late hour, and he had good hopes of hearing Huck's
maow, and of having his treasure to astonish Becky and the picnickers
with, next day; but he was disappointed. No signal came that night.
Morning came, eventually, and by ten or eleven o'clock a giddy and
rollicking company were gathered at Judge Thatcher's, and everything was
ready for a start. It was not the custom for elderly people to mar the
picnics with their presence. The children were considered safe enough
under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young
gentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts. The old steam ferry-boat was
chartered for the occasion; presently the gay throng filed up the main
street laden with provision-baskets. Sid was sick and had to miss
the fun; Mary remained at home to entertain him. The last thing Mrs.
Thatcher said to Becky, was:
You'll not get back till late. Perhaps you'd better stay all night with
some of the girls that live near the ferry-landing, child.
Then I'll stay with Susy Harper, mamma.
Very well. And mind and behave yourself and don't be any trouble.
Presently, as they tripped along, Tom said to Becky:
Say--I'll tell you what we'll do. 'Stead of going to Joe Harper's we'll
climb right up the hill and stop at the Widow Douglas'. She'll have
ice-cream! She has it most every day--dead loads of it. And she'll be
awful glad to have us.
Oh, that will be fun!
Then Becky reflected a moment and said:
But what will mamma say?
How'll she ever know?
The girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said reluctantly:
I reckon it's wrong--but--
But shucks! Your mother won't know, and so what's the harm? All she
wants is that you'll be safe; and I bet you she'd 'a' said go there if
she'd 'a' thought of it. I know she would!
The Widow Douglas' splendid hospitality was a tempting bait. It and
Tom's persuasions presently carried the day. So it was decided to say
nothing to anybody about the night's programme. Presently it occurred to
Tom that maybe Huck might come this very night and give the signal. The
thought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations. Still he
could not bear to give up the fun at Widow Douglas'. And why should he
give it up, he reasoned--the signal did not come the night before, so
why should it be any more likely to come tonight? The sure fun of the
evening outweighed the uncertain treasure; and, boy-like, he determined
to yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of
the box of money another time that day.
Three miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody
hollow and tied up. The crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest
distances and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and
laughter. All the different ways of getting hot and tired were gone
through with, and by-and-by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified
with responsible appetites, and then the destruction of the good things
began. After the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat in
the shade of spreading oaks. By-and-by somebody shouted:
Who's ready for the cave?
Everybody was. Bundles of candles were procured, and straightway there
was a general scamper up the hill. The mouth of the cave was up the
hillside--an opening shaped like a letter A. Its massive oaken door stood
unbarred. Within was a small chamber, chilly as an icehouse, and walled
by Nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat. It was
romantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out
upon the green valley shining in the sun. But the impressiveness of the
situation quickly wore off, and the romping began again. The moment
a candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it; a
struggle and a gallant defence followed, but the candle was soon knocked
down or blown out, and then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a
new chase. But all things have an end. By-and-by the procession went
filing down the steep descent of the main avenue, the flickering rank of
lights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their point of
junction sixty feet overhead. This main avenue was not more than
eight or ten feet wide. Every few steps other lofty and still narrower
crevices branched from it on either hand--for McDougal's cave was but a
vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and out again
and led nowhere. It was said that one might wander days and nights
together through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms, and never
find the end of the cave; and that he might go down, and down, and
still down, into the earth, and it was just the same--labyrinth under
labyrinth, and no end to any of them. No man knew the cave. That was
an impossible thing. Most of the young men knew a portion of it, and it
was not customary to venture much beyond this known portion. Tom Sawyer
knew as much of the cave as any one.
The procession moved along the main avenue some three-quarters of
a mile, and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch
avenues, fly along the dismal corridors, and take each other by surprise
at points where the corridors joined again. Parties were able to elude
each other for the space of half an hour without going beyond the
known ground.
By-and-by, one group after another came straggling back to the mouth
of the cave, panting, hilarious, smeared from head to foot with tallow
drippings, daubed with clay, and entirely delighted with the success of
the day. Then they were astonished to find that they had been taking
no note of time and that night was about at hand. The clanging bell had
been calling for half an hour. However, this sort of close to the day's
adventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory. When the ferryboat
with her wild freight pushed into the stream, nobody cared sixpence for
the wasted time but the captain of the craft.
Huck was already upon his watch when the ferryboat's lights went
glinting past the wharf. He heard no noise on board, for the young
people were as subdued and still as people usually are who are nearly
tired to death. He wondered what boat it was, and why she did not
stop at the wharf--and then he dropped her out of his mind and put his
attention upon his business. The night was growing cloudy and dark. Ten
o'clock came, and the noise of vehicles ceased, scattered lights began
to wink out, all straggling foot-passengers disappeared, the village
betook itself to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the
silence and the ghosts. Eleven o'clock came, and the tavern lights were
put out; darkness everywhere, now. Huck waited what seemed a weary long
time, but nothing happened. His faith was weakening. Was there any use?
Was there really any use? Why not give it up and turn in?
A noise fell upon his ear. He was all attention in an instant. The alley
door closed softly. He sprang to the corner of the brick store. The next
moment two men brushed by him, and one seemed to have something under
his arm. It must be that box! So they were going to remove the treasure.
Why call Tom now? It would be absurd--the men would get away with the box
and never be found again. No, he would stick to their wake and follow
them; he would trust to the darkness for security from discovery. So
communing with himself, Huck stepped out and glided along behind the
men, cat-like, with bare feet, allowing them to keep just far enough
ahead not to be invisible.
They moved up the river street three blocks, then turned to the left up
a crossstreet. They went straight ahead, then, until they came to the
path that led up Cardiff Hill; this they took. They passed by the old
Welshman's house, halfway up the hill, without hesitating, and still
climbed upward. Good, thought Huck, they will bury it in the old quarry.
But they never stopped at the quarry. They passed on, up the summit.
They plunged into the narrow path between the tall sumach bushes, and
were at once hidden in the gloom. Huck closed up and shortened his
distance, now, for they would never be able to see him. He trotted along
awhile; then slackened his pace, fearing he was gaining too fast; moved
on a piece, then stopped altogether; listened; no sound; none, save that
he seemed to hear the beating of his own heart. The hooting of an
owl came over the hill--ominous sound! But no footsteps. Heavens, was
everything lost! He was about to spring with winged feet, when a man
cleared his throat not four feet from him! Huck's heart shot into his
throat, but he swallowed it again; and then he stood there shaking as
if a dozen agues had taken charge of him at once, and so weak that he
thought he must surely fall to the ground. He knew where he was. He
knew he was within five steps of the stile leading into Widow Douglas'
grounds. Very well, he thought, let them bury it there; it won't be hard
to find.
Now there was a voice--a very low voice--Injun Joe's:
Damn her, maybe she's got company--there's lights, late as it is.
I can't see any.
This was that stranger's voice--the stranger of the haunted house. A
deadly chill went to Huck's heart--this, then, was the revenge job! His
thought was, to fly. Then he remembered that the Widow Douglas had been
kind to him more than once, and maybe these men were going to murder
her. He wished he dared venture to warn her; but he knew he didn't
dare--they might come and catch him. He thought all this and more in
the moment that elapsed between the stranger's remark and Injun Joe's
next--which was--
Because the bush is in your way. Now--this way--now you see, don't you?
Yes. Well, there _is_ company there, I reckon. Better give it up.
Give it up, and I just leaving this country forever! Give it up and
maybe never have another chance. I tell you again, as I've told you
before, I don't care for her swag--you may have it. But her husband was
rough on me--many times he was rough on me--and mainly he was the justice
of the peace that jugged me for a vagrant. And that ain't all. It ain't
a millionth part of it! He had me _horsewhipped_!--horsewhipped in
front of the jail, like a nigger!--with all the town looking on!
_Horsewhipped_!--do you understand? He took advantage of me and died. But
I'll take it out of _her_.
Oh, don't kill her! Don't do that!
Kill? Who said anything about killing? I would kill _him_ if he was
here; but not her. When you want to get revenge on a woman you don't
kill her--bosh! you go for her looks. You slit her nostrils--you notch her
ears like a sow!
By God, that's--
Keep your opinion to yourself! It will be safest for you. I'll tie her
to the bed. If she bleeds to death, is that my fault? I'll not cry, if
she does. My friend, you'll help me in this thing--for _my_ sake--that's
why you're here--I mightn't be able alone. If you flinch, I'll kill you.
Do you understand that? And if I have to kill you, I'll kill her--and
then I reckon nobody'll ever know much about who done this business.
Well, if it's got to be done, let's get at it. The quicker the
better--I'm all in a shiver.
Do it _now_? And company there? Look here--I'll get suspicious of you,
first thing you know. No--we'll wait till the lights are out--there's no
hurry.
Huck felt that a silence was going to ensue--a thing still more awful
than any amount of murderous talk; so he held his breath and stepped
gingerly back; planted his foot carefully and firmly, after balancing,
one-legged, in a precarious way and almost toppling over, first on one
side and then on the other. He took another step back, with the same
elaboration and the same risks; then another and another, and--a twig
snapped under his foot! His breath stopped and he listened. There was no
sound--the stillness was perfect. His gratitude was measureless. Now he
turned in his tracks, between the walls of sumach bushes--turned
himself as carefully as if he were a ship--and then stepped quickly but
cautiously along. When he emerged at the quarry he felt secure, and
so he picked up his nimble heels and flew. Down, down he sped, till he
reached the Welshman's. He banged at the door, and presently the heads
of the old man and his two stalwart sons were thrust from windows.
What's the row there? Who's banging? What do you want?
Let me in--quick! I'll tell everything.
Why, who are you?
Huckleberry Finn--quick, let me in!
Huckleberry Finn, indeed! It ain't a name to open many doors, I judge!
But let him in, lads, and let's see what's the trouble.
Please don't ever tell I told you, were Huck's first words when he got
in. Please don't--I'd be killed, sure--but the widow's been good friends
to me sometimes, and I want to tell--I _will_ tell if you'll promise you
won't ever say it was me.
By George, he _has_ got something to tell, or he wouldn't act so!
exclaimed the old man; out with it and nobody here'll ever tell, lad.
Three minutes later the old man and his sons, well armed, were up the
hill, and just entering the sumach path on tiptoe, their weapons in
their hands. Huck accompanied them no further. He hid behind a great
bowlder and fell to listening. There was a lagging, anxious silence, and
then all of a sudden there was an explosion of firearms and a cry.
Huck waited for no particulars. He sprang away and sped down the hill as
fast as his legs could carry him.
CHAPTER XXX
AS the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on Sunday morning, Huck came
groping up the hill and rapped gently at the old Welshman's door. The
inmates were asleep, but it was a sleep that was set on a hair-trigger,
on account of the exciting episode of the night. A call came from a
window:
Who's there!
Huck's scared voice answered in a low tone:
Please let me in! It's only Huck Finn!
It's a name that can open this door night or day, lad!--and welcome!
These were strange words to the vagabond boy's ears, and the pleasantest
he had ever heard. He could not recollect that the closing word had ever
been applied in his case before. The door was quickly unlocked, and he
entered. Huck was given a seat and the old man and his brace of tall
sons speedily dressed themselves.
Now, my boy, I hope you're good and hungry, because breakfast will be
ready as soon as the sun's up, and we'll have a piping hot one, too--make
yourself easy about that! I and the boys hoped you'd turn up and stop
here last night.
I was awful scared, said Huck, and I run. I took out when the pistols
went off, and I didn't stop for three mile. I've come now becuz I wanted
to know about it, you know; and I come before daylight becuz I didn't
want to run across them devils, even if they was dead.
Well, poor chap, you do look as if you'd had a hard night of it--but
there's a bed here for you when you've had your breakfast. No, they
ain't dead, lad--we are sorry enough for that. You see we knew right
where to put our hands on them, by your description; so we crept along
on tiptoe till we got within fifteen feet of them--dark as a cellar that
sumach path was--and just then I found I was going to sneeze. It was the
meanest kind of luck! I tried to keep it back, but no use--'twas bound to
come, and it did come! I was in the lead with my pistol raised, and when
the sneeze started those scoundrels a-rustling to get out of the path,
I sung out, 'Fire boys!' and blazed away at the place where the rustling
was. So did the boys. But they were off in a jiffy, those villains, and
we after them, down through the woods. I judge we never touched them.
They fired a shot apiece as they started, but their bullets whizzed by
and didn't do us any harm. As soon as we lost the sound of their feet
we quit chasing, and went down and stirred up the constables. They got a
posse together, and went off to guard the river bank, and as soon as it
is light the sheriff and a gang are going to beat up the woods. My boys
will be with them presently. I wish we had some sort of description of
those rascals--'twould help a good deal. But you couldn't see what they
were like, in the dark, lad, I suppose?
Oh yes; I saw them downtown and follered them.
Splendid! Describe them--describe them, my boy!
One's the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that's ben around here once or
twice, and t'other's a mean-looking, ragged--
That's enough, lad, we know the men! Happened on them in the woods back
of the widow's one day, and they slunk away. Off with you, boys, and
tell the sheriff--get your breakfast tomorrow morning!
The Welshman's sons departed at once. As they were leaving the room Huck
sprang up and exclaimed:
Oh, please don't tell _any_body it was me that blowed on them! Oh,
please!
All right if you say it, Huck, but you ought to have the credit of what
you did.
Oh no, no! Please don't tell!
When the young men were gone, the old Welshman said:
They won't tell--and I won't. But why don't you want it known?
Huck would not explain, further than to say that he already knew too
much about one of those men and would not have the man know that he knew
anything against him for the whole world--he would be killed for knowing
it, sure.
The old man promised secrecy once more, and said:
How did you come to follow these fellows, lad? Were they looking
suspicious?
Huck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply. Then he said:
Well, you see, I'm a kind of a hard lot,--least everybody says so, and
I don't see nothing agin it--and sometimes I can't sleep much, on account
of thinking about it and sort of trying to strike out a new way of
doing. That was the way of it last night. I couldn't sleep, and so I
come along upstreet 'bout midnight, a-turning it all over, and when I
got to that old shackly brick store by the Temperance Tavern, I backed
up agin the wall to have another think. Well, just then along comes
these two chaps slipping along close by me, with something under their
arm, and I reckoned they'd stole it. One was a-smoking, and t'other one
wanted a light; so they stopped right before me and the cigars lit up
their faces and I see that the big one was the deaf and dumb Spaniard,
by his white whiskers and the patch on his eye, and t'other one was a
rusty, ragged-looking devil.
Could you see the rags by the light of the cigars?
This staggered Huck for a moment. Then he said:
Well, I don't know--but somehow it seems as if I did.
Then they went on, and you--
Follered 'em--yes. That was it. I wanted to see what was up--they sneaked
along so. I dogged 'em to the widder's stile, and stood in the dark and
heard the ragged one beg for the widder, and the Spaniard swear he'd
spile her looks just as I told you and your two--
What! The _deaf and dumb_ man said all that!
Huck had made another terrible mistake! He was trying his best to keep
the old man from getting the faintest hint of who the Spaniard might be,
and yet his tongue seemed determined to get him into trouble in spite of
all he could do. He made several efforts to creep out of his scrape,
but the old man's eye was upon him and he made blunder after blunder.
Presently the Welshman said:
My boy, don't be afraid of me. I wouldn't hurt a hair of your head for
all the world. No--I'd protect you--I'd protect you. This Spaniard is
not deaf and dumb; you've let that slip without intending it; you can't
cover that up now. You know something about that Spaniard that you want
to keep dark. Now trust me--tell me what it is, and trust me--I won't
betray you.
Huck looked into the old man's honest eyes a moment, then bent over and
whispered in his ear:
'Tain't a Spaniard--it's Injun Joe!
The Welshman almost jumped out of his chair. In a moment he said:
It's all plain enough, now. When you talked about notching ears and
slitting noses I judged that that was your own embellishment, because
white men don't take that sort of revenge. But an Injun! That's a
different matter altogether.
During breakfast the talk went on, and in the course of it the old man
said that the last thing which he and his sons had done, before going
to bed, was to get a lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for
marks of blood. They found none, but captured a bulky bundle of--
Of _what_?
If the words had been lightning they could not have leaped with a more
stunning suddenness from Huck's blanched lips. His eyes were staring
wide, now, and his breath suspended--waiting for the answer. The Welshman
started--stared in return--three seconds--five seconds--ten--then replied:
Of burglar's tools. Why, what's the _matter_ with you?
Huck sank back, panting gently, but deeply, unutterably grateful. The
Welshman eyed him gravely, curiously--and presently said:
Yes, burglar's tools. That appears to relieve you a good deal. But what
did give you that turn? What were _you_ expecting we'd found?
Huck was in a close place--the inquiring eye was upon him--he would have
given anything for material for a plausible answer--nothing suggested
itself--the inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper--a senseless
reply offered--there was no time to weigh it, so at a venture he uttered
it--feebly:
Sunday-school books, maybe.
Poor Huck was too distressed to smile, but the old man laughed loud and
joyously, shook up the details of his anatomy from head to foot, and
ended by saying that such a laugh was money in a-man's pocket, because
it cut down the doctor's bill like everything. Then he added:
Poor old chap, you're white and jaded--you ain't well a bit--no wonder
you're a little flighty and off your balance. But you'll come out of it.
Rest and sleep will fetch you out all right, I hope.
Huck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such
a suspicious excitement, for he had dropped the idea that the parcel
brought from the tavern was the treasure, as soon as he had heard the
talk at the widow's stile. He had only thought it was not the treasure,
however--he had not known that it wasn't--and so the suggestion of a
captured bundle was too much for his self-possession. But on the whole
he felt glad the little episode had happened, for now he knew beyond all
question that that bundle was not _the_ bundle, and so his mind was
at rest and exceedingly comfortable. In fact, everything seemed to be
drifting just in the right direction, now; the treasure must be still
in No. 2, the men would be captured and jailed that day, and he and
Tom could seize the gold that night without any trouble or any fear of
interruption.
Just as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door. Huck
jumped for a hiding-place, for he had no mind to be connected even
remotely with the late event. The Welshman admitted several ladies and
gentlemen, among them the Widow Douglas, and noticed that groups of
citizens were climbing up the hill--to stare at the stile. So the news
had spread. The Welshman had to tell the story of the night to the
visitors. The widow's gratitude for her preservation was outspoken.
Don't say a word about it, madam. There's another that you're more
beholden to than you are to me and my boys, maybe, but he don't allow me
to tell his name. We wouldn't have been there but for him.
Of course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled the
main matter--but the Welshman allowed it to eat into the vitals of his
visitors, and through them be transmitted to the whole town, for he
refused to part with his secret. When all else had been learned, the
widow said:
I went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that
noise. Why didn't you come and wake me?
We judged it warn't worth while. Those fellows warn't likely to come
again--they hadn't any tools left to work with, and what was the use of
waking you up and scaring you to death? My three negro men stood guard
at your house all the rest of the night. They've just come back.
More visitors came, and the story had to be told and retold for a couple
of hours more.
There was no Sabbath-school during day-school vacation, but everybody
was early at church. The stirring event was well canvassed. News came
that not a sign of the two villains had been yet discovered. When the
sermon was finished, Judge Thatcher's wife dropped alongside of Mrs.
Harper as she moved down the aisle with the crowd and said:
Is my Becky going to sleep all day? I just expected she would be tired
to death.
Your Becky?
Yes, with a startled look--didn't she stay with you last night?
Why, no.
Mrs. Thatcher turned pale, and sank into a pew, just as Aunt Polly,
talking briskly with a friend, passed by. Aunt Polly said:
Goodmorning, Mrs. Thatcher. Goodmorning, Mrs. Harper. I've got a boy
that's turned up missing. I reckon my Tom stayed at your house last
night--one of you. And now he's afraid to come to church. I've got to
settle with him.
Mrs. Thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever.
He didn't stay with us, said Mrs. Harper, beginning to look uneasy. A
marked anxiety came into Aunt Polly's face.
Joe Harper, have you seen my Tom this morning?
No'm.
When did you see him last?
Joe tried to remember, but was not sure he could say. The people had
stopped moving out of church. Whispers passed along, and a boding
uneasiness took possession of every countenance. Children were anxiously
questioned, and young teachers. They all said they had not noticed
whether Tom and Becky were on board the ferryboat on the homeward trip;
it was dark; no one thought of inquiring if any one was missing. One
young man finally blurted out his fear that they were still in the cave!
Mrs. Thatcher swooned away. Aunt Polly fell to crying and wringing her
hands.
The alarm swept from lip to lip, from group to group, from street to
street, and within five minutes the bells were wildly clanging and
the whole town was up! The Cardiff Hill episode sank into instant
insignificance, the burglars were forgotten, horses were saddled, skiffs
were manned, the ferryboat ordered out, and before the horror was half
an hour old, two hundred men were pouring down highroad and river toward
the cave.
All the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead. Many women
visited Aunt Polly and Mrs. Thatcher and tried to comfort them. They
cried with them, too, and that was still better than words. All the
tedious night the town waited for news; but when the morning dawned at
last, all the word that came was, Send more candles--and send food.
Mrs. Thatcher was almost crazed; and Aunt Polly, also. Judge Thatcher
sent messages of hope and encouragement from the cave, but they conveyed
no real cheer.
The old Welshman came home toward daylight, spattered with
candle-grease, smeared with clay, and almost worn out. He found Huck
still in the bed that had been provided for him, and delirious with
fever. The physicians were all at the cave, so the Widow Douglas came
and took charge of the patient. She said she would do her best by him,
because, whether he was good, bad, or indifferent, he was the Lord's,
and nothing that was the Lord's was a thing to be neglected. The
Welshman said Huck had good spots in him, and the widow said:
You can depend on it. That's the Lord's mark. He don't leave it off.
He never does. Puts it somewhere on every creature that comes from his
hands.
Early in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the
village, but the strongest of the citizens continued searching. All the
news that could be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were being
ransacked that had never been visited before; that every corner and
crevice was going to be thoroughly searched; that wherever one wandered
through the maze of passages, lights were to be seen flitting hither
and thither in the distance, and shoutings and pistol-shots sent their
hollow reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles. In one place,
far from the section usually traversed by tourists, the names BECKY &
TOM had been found traced upon the rocky wall with candle-smoke, and
near at hand a grease-soiled bit of ribbon. Mrs. Thatcher recognized the
ribbon and cried over it. She said it was the last relic she should ever
have of her child; and that no other memorial of her could ever be so
precious, because this one parted latest from the living body before the
awful death came. Some said that now and then, in the cave, a far-away
speck of light would glimmer, and then a glorious shout would burst
forth and a score of men go trooping down the echoing aisle--and then a
sickening disappointment always followed; the children were not there;
it was only a searcher's light.
Three dreadful days and nights dragged their tedious hours along, and
the village sank into a hopeless stupor. No one had heart for anything.
The accidental discovery, just made, that the proprietor of the
Temperance Tavern kept liquor on his premises, scarcely fluttered the
public pulse, tremendous as the fact was. In a lucid interval, Huck
feebly led up to the subject of taverns, and finally asked--dimly
dreading the worst--if anything had been discovered at the Temperance
Tavern since he had been ill.
Yes, said the widow.
Huck started up in bed, wildeyed:
What? What was it?
Liquor!--and the place has been shut up. Lie down, child--what a turn you
did give me!
Only tell me just one thing--only just one--please! Was it Tom Sawyer
that found it?
The widow burst into tears. Hush, hush, child, hush! I've told you
before, you must _not_ talk. You are very, very sick!
Then nothing but liquor had been found; there would have been a great
powwow if it had been the gold. So the treasure was gone forever--gone
forever! But what could she be crying about? Curious that she should
cry.
These thoughts worked their dim way through Huck's mind, and under the
weariness they gave him he fell asleep. The widow said to herself:
There--he's asleep, poor wreck. Tom Sawyer find it! Pity but somebody
could find Tom Sawyer! Ah, there ain't many left, now, that's got hope
enough, or strength enough, either, to go on searching.
CHAPTER XXXI
NOW to return to Tom and Becky's share in the picnic. They tripped along
the murky aisles with the rest of the company, visiting the familiar
wonders of the cave--wonders dubbed with rather over-descriptive names,
such as The Drawing-Room, The Cathedral, Aladdin's Palace, and
so on. Presently the hide-and-seek frolicking began, and Tom and Becky
engaged in it with zeal until the exertion began to grow a trifle
wearisome; then they wandered down a sinuous avenue holding their
candles aloft and reading the tangled webwork of names, dates,
postoffice addresses, and mottoes with which the rocky walls had been
frescoed (in candle-smoke). Still drifting along and talking, they
scarcely noticed that they were now in a part of the cave whose walls
were not frescoed. They smoked their own names under an overhanging
shelf and moved on. Presently they came to a place where a little stream
of water, trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone sediment with
it, had, in the slow-dragging ages, formed a laced and ruffled Niagara
in gleaming and imperishable stone. Tom squeezed his small body behind
it in order to illuminate it for Becky's gratification. He found that
it curtained a sort of steep natural stairway which was enclosed between
narrow walls, and at once the ambition to be a discoverer seized him.
Becky responded to his call, and they made a smoke-mark for future
guidance, and started upon their quest. They wound this way and that,
far down into the secret depths of the cave, made another mark, and
branched off in search of novelties to tell the upper world about. In
one place they found a spacious cavern, from whose ceiling depended a
multitude of shining stalactites of the length and circumference of
a man's leg; they walked all about it, wondering and admiring, and
presently left it by one of the numerous passages that opened into
it. This shortly brought them to a bewitching spring, whose basin was
incrusted with a frostwork of glittering crystals; it was in the midst
of a cavern whose walls were supported by many fantastic pillars which
had been formed by the joining of great stalactites and stalagmites
together, the result of the ceaseless water-drip of centuries. Under the
roof vast knots of bats had packed themselves together, thousands in a
bunch; the lights disturbed the creatures and they came flocking down by
hundreds, squeaking and darting furiously at the candles. Tom knew their
ways and the danger of this sort of conduct. He seized Becky's hand and
hurried her into the first corridor that offered; and none too soon, for
a bat struck Becky's light out with its wing while she was passing out
of the cavern. The bats chased the children a good distance; but the
fugitives plunged into every new passage that offered, and at last got
rid of the perilous things. Tom found a subterranean lake, shortly,
which stretched its dim length away until its shape was lost in the
shadows. He wanted to explore its borders, but concluded that it would
be best to sit down and rest awhile, first. Now, for the first time, the
deep stillness of the place laid a clammy hand upon the spirits of the
children. Becky said:
Why, I didn't notice, but it seems ever so long since I heard any of
the others.
Come to think, Becky, we are away down below them--and I don't know how
far away north, or south, or east, or whichever it is. We couldn't hear
them here.
Becky grew apprehensive.
I wonder how long we've been down here, Tom? We better start back.
Yes, I reckon we better. P'raps we better.
Can you find the way, Tom? It's all a mixed-up crookedness to me.
I reckon I could find it--but then the bats. If they put our candles
out it will be an awful fix. Let's try some other way, so as not to go
through there.
Well. But I hope we won't get lost. It would be so awful! and the girl
shuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities.
They started through a corridor, and traversed it in silence a long
way, glancing at each new opening, to see if there was anything familiar
about the look of it; but they were all strange. Every time Tom made an
examination, Becky would watch his face for an encouraging sign, and he
would say cheerily:
Oh, it's all right. This ain't the one, but we'll come to it right
away!
But he felt less and less hopeful with each failure, and presently began
to turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random, in desperate hope of
finding the one that was wanted. He still said it was all right, but
there was such a leaden dread at his heart that the words had lost their
ring and sounded just as if he had said, All is lost! Becky clung to
his side in an anguish of fear, and tried hard to keep back the tears,
but they would come. At last she said:
Oh, Tom, never mind the bats, let's go back that way! We seem to get
worse and worse off all the time.
Listen! said he.
Profound silence; silence so deep that even their breathings were
conspicuous in the hush. Tom shouted. The call went echoing down
the empty aisles and died out in the distance in a faint sound that
resembled a ripple of mocking laughter.
Oh, don't do it again, Tom, it is too horrid, said Becky.
It is horrid, but I better, Becky; they might hear us, you know, and
he shouted again.
The might was even a chillier horror than the ghostly laughter, it so
confessed a perishing hope. The children stood still and listened; but
there was no result. Tom turned upon the back track at once, and hurried
his steps. It was but a little while before a certain indecision in his
manner revealed another fearful fact to Becky--he could not find his way
back!
Oh, Tom, you didn't make any marks!
Becky, I was such a fool! Such a fool! I never thought we might want to
come back! No--I can't find the way. It's all mixed up.
Tom, Tom, we're lost! we're lost! We never can get out of this awful
place! Oh, why _did_ we ever leave the others!
She sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that Tom
was appalled with the idea that she might die, or lose her reason. He
sat down by her and put his arms around her; she buried her face in
his bosom, she clung to him, she poured out her terrors, her unavailing
regrets, and the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter. Tom
begged her to pluck up hope again, and she said she could not. He fell
to blaming and abusing himself for getting her into this miserable
situation; this had a better effect. She said she would try to hope
again, she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he
would not talk like that any more. For he was no more to blame than she,
she said.
So they moved on again--aimlessly--simply at random--all they could do
was to move, keep moving. For a little while, hope made a show of
reviving--not with any reason to back it, but only because it is its
nature to revive when the spring has not been taken out of it by age and
familiarity with failure.
By-and-by Tom took Becky's candle and blew it out. This economy meant so
much! Words were not needed. Becky understood, and her hope died again.
She knew that Tom had a whole candle and three or four pieces in his
pockets--yet he must economize.
By-and-by, fatigue began to assert its claims; the children tried to pay
attention, for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time was
grown to be so precious, moving, in some direction, in any direction,
was at least progress and might bear fruit; but to sit down was to
invite death and shorten its pursuit.
At last Becky's frail limbs refused to carry her farther. She sat down.
Tom rested with her, and they talked of home, and the friends there,
and the comfortable beds and, above all, the light! Becky cried, and Tom
tried to think of some way of comforting her, but all his encouragements
were grown thread-bare with use, and sounded like sarcasms. Fatigue bore
so heavily upon Becky that she drowsed off to sleep. Tom was grateful.
He sat looking into her drawn face and saw it grow smooth and natural
under the influence of pleasant dreams; and by-and-by a smile dawned and
rested there. The peaceful face reflected somewhat of peace and healing
into his own spirit, and his thoughts wandered away to bygone times and
dreamy memories. While he was deep in his musings, Becky woke up with a
breezy little laugh--but it was stricken dead upon her lips, and a groan
followed it.
Oh, how _could_ I sleep! I wish I never, never had waked! No! No, I
don't, Tom! Don't look so! I won't say it again.
I'm glad you've slept, Becky; you'll feel rested, now, and we'll find
the way out.
We can try, Tom; but I've seen such a beautiful country in my dream. I
reckon we are going there.
Maybe not, maybe not. Cheer up, Becky, and let's go on trying.
They rose up and wandered along, hand in hand and hopeless. They tried
to estimate how long they had been in the cave, but all they knew was
that it seemed days and weeks, and yet it was plain that this could not
be, for their candles were not gone yet. A long time after this--they
could not tell how long--Tom said they must go softly and listen for
dripping water--they must find a spring. They found one presently, and
Tom said it was time to rest again. Both were cruelly tired, yet Becky
said she thought she could go a little farther. She was surprised to
hear Tom dissent. She could not understand it. They sat down, and Tom
fastened his candle to the wall in front of them with some clay. Thought
was soon busy; nothing was said for some time. Then Becky broke the
silence:
Tom, I am so hungry!
Tom took something out of his pocket.
Do you remember this? said he.
Becky almost smiled.
It's our wedding-cake, Tom.
Yes--I wish it was as big as a barrel, for it's all we've got.
I saved it from the picnic for us to dream on, Tom, the way grownup
people do with wedding-cake--but it'll be our--
She dropped the sentence where it was. Tom divided the cake and Becky
ate with good appetite, while Tom nibbled at his moiety. There was
abundance of cold water to finish the feast with. By-and-by Becky
suggested that they move on again. Tom was silent a moment. Then he
said:
Becky, can you bear it if I tell you something?
Becky's face paled, but she thought she could.
Well, then, Becky, we must stay here, where there's water to drink.
That little piece is our last candle!
Becky gave loose to tears and wailings. Tom did what he could to comfort
her, but with little effect. At length Becky said:
Tom!
Well, Becky?
They'll miss us and hunt for us!
Yes, they will! Certainly they will!
Maybe they're hunting for us now, Tom.
Why, I reckon maybe they are. I hope they are.
When would they miss us, Tom?
When they get back to the boat, I reckon.
Tom, it might be dark then--would they notice we hadn't come?
I don't know. But anyway, your mother would miss you as soon as they
got home.
A frightened look in Becky's face brought Tom to his senses and he saw
that he had made a blunder. Becky was not to have gone home that night!
The children became silent and thoughtful. In a moment a new burst of
grief from Becky showed Tom that the thing in his mind had struck hers
also--that the Sabbath morning might be half spent before Mrs. Thatcher
discovered that Becky was not at Mrs. Harper's.
The children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and watched it
melt slowly and pitilessly away; saw the half inch of wick stand alone
at last; saw the feeble flame rise and fall, climb the thin column of
smoke, linger at its top a moment, and then--the horror of utter darkness
reigned!
How long afterward it was that Becky came to a slow consciousness that
she was crying in Tom's arms, neither could tell. All that they knew
was, that after what seemed a mighty stretch of time, both awoke out of
a dead stupor of sleep and resumed their miseries once more. Tom said
it might be Sunday, now--maybe Monday. He tried to get Becky to talk, but
her sorrows were too oppressive, all her hopes were gone. Tom said that
they must have been missed long ago, and no doubt the search was going
on. He would shout and maybe some one would come. He tried it; but in
the darkness the distant echoes sounded so hideously that he tried it no
more.
The hours wasted away, and hunger came to torment the captives again. A
portion of Tom's half of the cake was left; they divided and ate it. But
they seemed hungrier than before. The poor morsel of food only whetted
desire.
By-and-by Tom said:
SH! Did you hear that?
Both held their breath and listened. There was a sound like the
faintest, far-off shout. Instantly Tom answered it, and leading Becky by
the hand, started groping down the corridor in its direction. Presently
he listened again; again the sound was heard, and apparently a little
nearer.
It's them! said Tom; they're coming! Come along, Becky--we're all
right now!
The joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming. Their speed was slow,
however, because pitfalls were somewhat common, and had to be guarded
against. They shortly came to one and had to stop. It might be three
feet deep, it might be a hundred--there was no passing it at any rate.
Tom got down on his breast and reached as far down as he could. No
bottom. They must stay there and wait until the searchers came. They
listened; evidently the distant shoutings were growing more distant!
a moment or two more and they had gone altogether. The heart-sinking
misery of it! Tom whooped until he was hoarse, but it was of no use. He
talked hopefully to Becky; but an age of anxious waiting passed and no
sounds came again.
The children groped their way back to the spring. The weary time dragged
on; they slept again, and awoke famished and woe-stricken. Tom believed
it must be Tuesday by this time.
Now an idea struck him. There were some side passages near at hand. It
would be better to explore some of these than bear the weight of the
heavy time in idleness. He took a kite-line from his pocket, tied it to
a projection, and he and Becky started, Tom in the lead, unwinding the
line as he groped along. At the end of twenty steps the corridor ended
in a jumping-off place. Tom got down on his knees and felt below,
and then as far around the corner as he could reach with his hands
conveniently; he made an effort to stretch yet a little farther to the
right, and at that moment, not twenty yards away, a human hand, holding
a candle, appeared from behind a rock! Tom lifted up a glorious shout,
and instantly that hand was followed by the body it belonged to--Injun
Joe's! Tom was paralyzed; he could not move. He was vastly gratified the
next moment, to see the Spaniard take to his heels and get himself out
of sight. Tom wondered that Joe had not recognized his voice and come
over and killed him for testifying in court. But the echoes must have
disguised the voice. Without doubt, that was it, he reasoned. Tom's
fright weakened every muscle in his body. He said to himself that if he
had strength enough to get back to the spring he would stay there, and
nothing should tempt him to run the risk of meeting Injun Joe again. He
was careful to keep from Becky what it was he had seen. He told her he
had only shouted for luck.
But hunger and wretchedness rise superior to fears in the long run.
Another tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep brought
changes. The children awoke tortured with a raging hunger. Tom believed
that it must be Wednesday or Thursday or even Friday or Saturday, now,
and that the search had been given over. He proposed to explore another
passage. He felt willing to risk Injun Joe and all other terrors. But
Becky was very weak. She had sunk into a dreary apathy and would not be
roused. She said she would wait, now, where she was, and die--it would
not be long. She told Tom to go with the kite-line and explore if he
chose; but she implored him to come back every little while and speak
to her; and she made him promise that when the awful time came, he would
stay by her and hold her hand until all was over.
Tom kissed her, with a choking sensation in his throat, and made a show
of being confident of finding the searchers or an escape from the cave;
then he took the kite-line in his hand and went groping down one of the
passages on his hands and knees, distressed with hunger and sick with
bodings of coming doom.
CHAPTER XXXII
TUESDAY afternoon came, and waned to the twilight. The village of St.
Petersburg still mourned. The lost children had not been found. Public
prayers had been offered up for them, and many and many a private prayer
that had the petitioner's whole heart in it; but still no good news came
from the cave. The majority of the searchers had given up the quest
and gone back to their daily avocations, saying that it was plain the
children could never be found. Mrs. Thatcher was very ill, and a great
part of the time delirious. People said it was heartbreaking to hear her
call her child, and raise her head and listen a whole minute at a time,
then lay it wearily down again with a moan. Aunt Polly had drooped into
a settled melancholy, and her gray hair had grown almost white. The
village went to its rest on Tuesday night, sad and forlorn.
Away in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village
bells, and in a moment the streets were swarming with frantic half-clad
people, who shouted, Turn out! turn out! they're found! they're found!
Tin pans and horns were added to the din, the population massed itself
and moved toward the river, met the children coming in an open carriage
drawn by shouting citizens, thronged around it, joined its homeward
march, and swept magnificently up the main street roaring huzzah after
huzzah!
The village was illuminated; nobody went to bed again; it was the
greatest night the little town had ever seen. During the first half-hour
a procession of villagers filed through Judge Thatcher's house, seized
the saved ones and kissed them, squeezed Mrs. Thatcher's hand, tried to
speak but couldn't--and drifted out raining tears all over the place.
Aunt Polly's happiness was complete, and Mrs. Thatcher's nearly so. It
would be complete, however, as soon as the messenger dispatched with the
great news to the cave should get the word to her husband. Tom lay upon
a sofa with an eager auditory about him and told the history of the
wonderful adventure, putting in many striking additions to adorn it
withal; and closed with a description of how he left Becky and went
on an exploring expedition; how he followed two avenues as far as his
kite-line would reach; how he followed a third to the fullest stretch
of the kite-line, and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a far-off
speck that looked like daylight; dropped the line and groped toward it,
pushed his head and shoulders through a small hole, and saw the broad
Mississippi rolling by!
And if it had only happened to be night he would not have seen that
speck of daylight and would not have explored that passage any more! He
told how he went back for Becky and broke the good news and she told
him not to fret her with such stuff, for she was tired, and knew she was
going to die, and wanted to. He described how he labored with her and
convinced her; and how she almost died for joy when she had groped to
where she actually saw the blue speck of daylight; how he pushed his way
out at the hole and then helped her out; how they sat there and cried
for gladness; how some men came along in a skiff and Tom hailed them
and told them their situation and their famished condition; how the men
didn't believe the wild tale at first, because, said they, you are
five miles down the river below the valley the cave is in--then took
them aboard, rowed to a house, gave them supper, made them rest till two
or three hours after dark and then brought them home.
Before day-dawn, Judge Thatcher and the handful of searchers with him
were tracked out, in the cave, by the twine clews they had strung behind
them, and informed of the great news.
Three days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to
be shaken off at once, as Tom and Becky soon discovered. They were
bedridden all of Wednesday and Thursday, and seemed to grow more and
more tired and worn, all the time. Tom got about, a little, on Thursday,
was downtown Friday, and nearly as whole as ever Saturday; but Becky
did not leave her room until Sunday, and then she looked as if she had
passed through a wasting illness.
Tom learned of Huck's sickness and went to see him on Friday, but could
not be admitted to the bedroom; neither could he on Saturday or Sunday.
He was admitted daily after that, but was warned to keep still about his
adventure and introduce no exciting topic. The Widow Douglas stayed by
to see that he obeyed. At home Tom learned of the Cardiff Hill event;
also that the ragged man's body had eventually been found in the river
near the ferry-landing; he had been drowned while trying to escape,
perhaps.
About a fortnight after Tom's rescue from the cave, he started off to
visit Huck, who had grown plenty strong enough, now, to hear exciting
talk, and Tom had some that would interest him, he thought. Judge
Thatcher's house was on Tom's way, and he stopped to see Becky. The
Judge and some friends set Tom to talking, and some one asked him
ironically if he wouldn't like to go to the cave again. Tom said he
thought he wouldn't mind it. The Judge said:
Well, there are others just like you, Tom, I've not the least doubt.
But we have taken care of that. Nobody will get lost in that cave any
more.
Why?
Because I had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks ago, and
triple-locked--and I've got the keys.
Tom turned as white as a sheet.
What's the matter, boy! Here, run, somebody! Fetch a glass of water!
The water was brought and thrown into Tom's face.
Ah, now you're all right. What was the matter with you, Tom?
Oh, Judge, Injun Joe's in the cave!
CHAPTER XXXIII
WITHIN a few minutes the news had spread, and a dozen skiff-loads of
men were on their way to McDougal's cave, and the ferryboat, well filled
with passengers, soon followed. Tom Sawyer was in the skiff that bore
Judge Thatcher.
When the cave door was unlocked, a sorrowful sight presented itself in
the dim twilight of the place. Injun Joe lay stretched upon the ground,
dead, with his face close to the crack of the door, as if his longing
eyes had been fixed, to the latest moment, upon the light and the cheer
of the free world outside. Tom was touched, for he knew by his own
experience how this wretch had suffered. His pity was moved, but
nevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security, now,
which revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated
before how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the day
he lifted his voice against this bloody-minded outcast.
Injun Joe's bowie-knife lay close by, its blade broken in two. The great
foundation-beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through, with
tedious labor; useless labor, too, it was, for the native rock formed a
sill outside it, and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought
no effect; the only damage done was to the knife itself. But if there
had been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been useless
still, for if the beam had been wholly cut away Injun Joe could not have
squeezed his body under the door, and he knew it. So he had only hacked
that place in order to be doing something--in order to pass the weary
time--in order to employ his tortured faculties. Ordinarily one could
find half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevices of this
vestibule, left there by tourists; but there were none now. The prisoner
had searched them out and eaten them. He had also contrived to catch a
few bats, and these, also, he had eaten, leaving only their claws. The
poor unfortunate had starved to death. In one place, near at hand, a
stalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for ages, builded
by the water-drip from a stalactite overhead. The captive had broken off
the stalagmite, and upon the stump had placed a stone, wherein he had
scooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop that fell once
in every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a clock-tick--a
dessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours. That drop was falling
when the Pyramids were new; when Troy fell; when the foundations of Rome
were laid; when Christ was crucified; when the Conqueror created the
British empire; when Columbus sailed; when the massacre at Lexington was
news.
It is falling now; it will still be falling when all these things shall
have sunk down the afternoon of history, and the twilight of tradition,
and been swallowed up in the thick night of oblivion. Has everything a
purpose and a mission? Did this drop fall patiently during five thousand
years to be ready for this flitting human insect's need? and has it
another important object to accomplish ten thousand years to come? No
matter. It is many and many a year since the hapless half-breed scooped
out the stone to catch the priceless drops, but to this day the tourist
stares longest at that pathetic stone and that slow-dropping water when
he comes to see the wonders of McDougal's cave. Injun Joe's cup stands
first in the list of the cavern's marvels; even Aladdin's Palace
cannot rival it.
Injun Joe was buried near the mouth of the cave; and people flocked
there in boats and wagons from the towns and from all the farms and
hamlets for seven miles around; they brought their children, and
all sorts of provisions, and confessed that they had had almost as
satisfactory a time at the funeral as they could have had at the
hanging.
This funeral stopped the further growth of one thing--the petition to the
governor for Injun Joe's pardon. The petition had been largely signed;
many tearful and eloquent meetings had been held, and a committee of
sappy women been appointed to go in deep mourning and wail around the
governor, and implore him to be a merciful ass and trample his duty
under foot. Injun Joe was believed to have killed five citizens of the
village, but what of that? If he had been Satan himself there would
have been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names to a
pardon-petition, and drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired
and leaky water-works.
The morning after the funeral Tom took Huck to a private place to have
an important talk. Huck had learned all about Tom's adventure from the
Welshman and the Widow Douglas, by this time, but Tom said he reckoned
there was one thing they had not told him; that thing was what he wanted
to talk about now. Huck's face saddened. He said:
I know what it is. You got into No. 2 and never found anything but
whiskey. Nobody told me it was you; but I just knowed it must 'a' ben
you, soon as I heard 'bout that whiskey business; and I knowed you
hadn't got the money becuz you'd 'a' got at me some way or other and
told me even if you was mum to everybody else. Tom, something's always
told me we'd never get holt of that swag.
Why, Huck, I never told on that tavern-keeper. _You_ know his tavern
was all right the Saturday I went to the picnic. Don't you remember you
was to watch there that night?
Oh yes! Why, it seems 'bout a year ago. It was that very night that I
follered Injun Joe to the widder's.
_You_ followed him?
Yes--but you keep mum. I reckon Injun Joe's left friends behind him, and
I don't want 'em souring on me and doing me mean tricks. If it hadn't
ben for me he'd be down in Texas now, all right.
Then Huck told his entire adventure in confidence to Tom, who had only
heard of the Welshman's part of it before.
Well, said Huck, presently, coming back to the main question, whoever
nipped the whiskey in No. 2, nipped the money, too, I reckon--anyways
it's a goner for us, Tom.
Huck, that money wasn't ever in No. 2!
What! Huck searched his comrade's face keenly. Tom, have you got on
the track of that money again?
Huck, it's in the cave!
Huck's eyes blazed.
Say it again, Tom.
The money's in the cave!
Tom--honest injun, now--is it fun, or earnest?
Earnest, Huck--just as earnest as ever I was in my life. Will you go in
there with me and help get it out?
I bet I will! I will if it's where we can blaze our way to it and not
get lost.
Huck, we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in the
world.
Good as wheat! What makes you think the money's--
Huck, you just wait till we get in there. If we don't find it I'll
agree to give you my drum and every thing I've got in the world. I will,
by jings.
All right--it's a whiz. When do you say?
Right now, if you say it. Are you strong enough?
Is it far in the cave? I ben on my pins a little, three or four days,
now, but I can't walk more'n a mile, Tom--least I don't think I could.
It's about five mile into there the way anybody but me would go, Huck,
but there's a mighty short cut that they don't anybody but me know
about. Huck, I'll take you right to it in a skiff. I'll float the skiff
down there, and I'll pull it back again all by myself. You needn't ever
turn your hand over.
Less start right off, Tom.
All right. We want some bread and meat, and our pipes, and a little
bag or two, and two or three kite-strings, and some of these new-fangled
things they call lucifer matches. I tell you, many's the time I wished I
had some when I was in there before.
A trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a citizen who
was absent, and got under way at once. When they were several miles
below Cave Hollow, Tom said:
Now you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down from the
cave hollow--no houses, no wood-yards, bushes all alike. But do you see
that white place up yonder where there's been a landslide? Well, that's
one of my marks. We'll get ashore, now.
They landed.
Now, Huck, where we're a-standing you could touch that hole I got out
of with a fishing-pole. See if you can find it.
Huck searched all the place about, and found nothing. Tom proudly
marched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said:
Here you are! Look at it, Huck; it's the snuggest hole in this country.
You just keep mum about it. All along I've been wanting to be a robber,
but I knew I'd got to have a thing like this, and where to run across
it was the bother. We've got it now, and we'll keep it quiet, only we'll
let Joe Harper and Ben Rogers in--because of course there's got to be a
Gang, or else there wouldn't be any style about it. Tom Sawyer's Gang--it
sounds splendid, don't it, Huck?
Well, it just does, Tom. And who'll we rob?
Oh, most anybody. Waylay people--that's mostly the way.
And kill them?
No, not always. Hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom.
What's a ransom?
Money. You make them raise all they can, off'n their friends; and after
you've kept them a year, if it ain't raised then you kill them. That's
the general way. Only you don't kill the women. You shut up the women,
but you don't kill them. They're always beautiful and rich, and awfully
scared. You take their watches and things, but you always take your hat
off and talk polite. They ain't anybody as polite as robbers--you'll see
that in any book. Well, the women get to loving you, and after they've
been in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and after that
you couldn't get them to leave. If you drove them out they'd turn right
around and come back. It's so in all the books.
Why, it's real bully, Tom. I believe it's better'n to be a pirate.
Yes, it's better in some ways, because it's close to home and circuses
and all that.
By this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole, Tom in
the lead. They toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnel, then
made their spliced kite-strings fast and moved on. A few steps brought
them to the spring, and Tom felt a shudder quiver all through him.
He showed Huck the fragment of candle-wick perched on a lump of clay
against the wall, and described how he and Becky had watched the flame
struggle and expire.
The boys began to quiet down to whispers, now, for the stillness and
gloom of the place oppressed their spirits. They went on, and presently
entered and followed Tom's other corridor until they reached the
jumping-off place. The candles revealed the fact that it was not
really a precipice, but only a steep clay hill twenty or thirty feet
high. Tom whispered:
Now I'll show you something, Huck.
He held his candle aloft and said:
Look as far around the corner as you can. Do you see that? There--on the
big rock over yonder--done with candle-smoke.
Tom, it's a _cross_!
_Now_ where's your Number Two? '_under the cross_,' hey? Right yonder's
where I saw Injun Joe poke up his candle, Huck!
Huck stared at the mystic sign awhile, and then said with a shaky voice:
Tom, less git out of here!
What! and leave the treasure?
Yes--leave it. Injun Joe's ghost is round about there, certain.
No it ain't, Huck, no it ain't. It would ha'nt the place where he
died--away out at the mouth of the cave--five mile from here.
No, Tom, it wouldn't. It would hang round the money. I know the ways of
ghosts, and so do you.
Tom began to fear that Huck was right. Mis-givings gathered in his mind.
But presently an idea occurred to him--
Lookyhere, Huck, what fools we're making of ourselves! Injun Joe's
ghost ain't a going to come around where there's a cross!
The point was well taken. It had its effect.
Tom, I didn't think of that. But that's so. It's luck for us, that
cross is. I reckon we'll climb down there and have a hunt for that box.
Tom went first, cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he descended.
Huck followed. Four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the
great rock stood in. The boys examined three of them with no result.
They found a small recess in the one nearest the base of the rock, with
a pallet of blankets spread down in it; also an old suspender, some
bacon rind, and the well-gnawed bones of two or three fowls. But there
was no moneybox. The lads searched and researched this place, but in
vain. Tom said:
He said _under_ the cross. Well, this comes nearest to being under the
cross. It can't be under the rock itself, because that sets solid on the
ground.
They searched everywhere once more, and then sat down discouraged. Huck
could suggest nothing. By-and-by Tom said:
Lookyhere, Huck, there's footprints and some candle-grease on the clay
about one side of this rock, but not on the other sides. Now, what's
that for? I bet you the money _is_ under the rock. I'm going to dig in
the clay.
That ain't no bad notion, Tom! said Huck with animation.
Tom's real Barlow was out at once, and he had not dug four inches
before he struck wood.
Hey, Huck!--you hear that?
Huck began to dig and scratch now. Some boards were soon uncovered and
removed. They had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock.
Tom got into this and held his candle as far under the rock as he
could, but said he could not see to the end of the rift. He proposed
to explore. He stooped and passed under; the narrow way descended
gradually. He followed its winding course, first to the right, then to
the left, Huck at his heels. Tom turned a short curve, by-and-by, and
exclaimed:
My goodness, Huck, lookyhere!
It was the treasure-box, sure enough, occupying a snug little cavern,
along with an empty powder-keg, a couple of guns in leather cases, two
or three pairs of old moccasins, a leather belt, and some other rubbish
well soaked with the water-drip.
Got it at last! said Huck, ploughing among the tarnished coins with
his hand. My, but we're rich, Tom!
Huck, I always reckoned we'd get it. It's just too good to believe, but
we _have_ got it, sure! Say--let's not fool around here. Let's snake it
out. Lemme see if I can lift the box.
It weighed about fifty pounds. Tom could lift it, after an awkward
fashion, but could not carry it conveniently.
I thought so, he said; _They_ carried it like it was heavy, that day
at the ha'nted house. I noticed that. I reckon I was right to think of
fetching the little bags along.
The money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the cross
rock.
Now less fetch the guns and things, said Huck.
No, Huck--leave them there. They're just the tricks to have when we
go to robbing. We'll keep them there all the time, and we'll hold our
orgies there, too. It's an awful snug place for orgies.
What orgies?
I dono. But robbers always have orgies, and of course we've got to
have them, too. Come along, Huck, we've been in here a long time. It's
getting late, I reckon. I'm hungry, too. We'll eat and smoke when we get
to the skiff.
They presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes, looked warily
out, found the coast clear, and were soon lunching and smoking in the
skiff. As the sun dipped toward the horizon they pushed out and got
under way. Tom skimmed up the shore through the long twilight, chatting
cheerily with Huck, and landed shortly after dark.
Now, Huck, said Tom, we'll hide the money in the loft of the widow's
woodshed, and I'll come up in the morning and we'll count it and divide,
and then we'll hunt up a place out in the woods for it where it will be
safe. Just you lay quiet here and watch the stuff till I run and hook
Benny Taylor's little wagon; I won't be gone a minute.
He disappeared, and presently returned with the wagon, put the two small
sacks into it, threw some old rags on top of them, and started off,
dragging his cargo behind him. When the boys reached the Welshman's
house, they stopped to rest. Just as they were about to move on, the
Welshman stepped out and said:
Hallo, who's that?
Huck and Tom Sawyer.
Good! Come along with me, boys, you are keeping everybody waiting.
Here--hurry up, trot ahead--I'll haul the wagon for you. Why, it's not as
light as it might be. Got bricks in it?--or old metal?
Old metal, said Tom.
I judged so; the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool away
more time hunting up six bits' worth of old iron to sell to the foundry
than they would to make twice the money at regular work. But that's
human nature--hurry along, hurry along!
The boys wanted to know what the hurry was about.
Never mind; you'll see, when we get to the Widow Douglas'.
Huck said with some apprehension--for he was long used to being falsely
accused:
Mr. Jones, we haven't been doing nothing.
The Welshman laughed.
Well, I don't know, Huck, my boy. I don't know about that. Ain't you
and the widow good friends?
Yes. Well, she's ben good friends to me, anyway.
All right, then. What do you want to be afraid for?
This question was not entirely answered in Huck's slow mind before he
found himself pushed, along with Tom, into Mrs. Douglas' drawing-room.
Mr. Jones left the wagon near the door and followed.
The place was grandly lighted, and everybody that was of any consequence
in the village was there. The Thatchers were there, the Harpers, the
Rogerses, Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, the minister, the editor, and a great
many more, and all dressed in their best. The widow received the boys
as heartily as any one could well receive two such looking beings. They
were covered with clay and candle-grease. Aunt Polly blushed crimson
with humiliation, and frowned and shook her head at Tom. Nobody suffered
half as much as the two boys did, however. Mr. Jones said:
Tom wasn't at home, yet, so I gave him up; but I stumbled on him and
Huck right at my door, and so I just brought them along in a hurry.
And you did just right, said the widow. Come with me, boys.
She took them to a bedchamber and said:
Now wash and dress yourselves. Here are two new suits of
clothes--shirts, socks, everything complete. They're Huck's--no, no
thanks, Huck--Mr. Jones bought one and I the other. But they'll fit both
of you. Get into them. We'll wait--come down when you are slicked up
enough.
Then she left.
CHAPTER XXXIV
HUCK said: Tom, we can slope, if we can find a rope. The window ain't
high from the ground.
Shucks! what do you want to slope for?
Well, I ain't used to that kind of a crowd. I can't stand it. I ain't
going down there, Tom.
Oh, bother! It ain't anything. I don't mind it a bit. I'll take care of
you.
Sid appeared.
Tom, said he, auntie has been waiting for you all the afternoon. Mary
got your Sunday clothes ready, and everybody's been fretting about you.
Say--ain't this grease and clay, on your clothes?
Now, Mr. Siddy, you jist 'tend to your own business. What's all this
blowout about, anyway?
It's one of the widow's parties that she's always having. This time
it's for the Welshman and his sons, on account of that scrape they
helped her out of the other night. And say--I can tell you something, if
you want to know.
Well, what?
Why, old Mr. Jones is going to try to spring something on the people
here tonight, but I overheard him tell auntie today about it, as a
secret, but I reckon it's not much of a secret now. Everybody knows--the
widow, too, for all she tries to let on she don't. Mr. Jones was bound
Huck should be here--couldn't get along with his grand secret without
Huck, you know!
Secret about what, Sid?
About Huck tracking the robbers to the widow's. I reckon Mr. Jones was
going to make a grand time over his surprise, but I bet you it will drop
pretty flat.
Sid chuckled in a very contented and satisfied way.
Sid, was it you that told?
Oh, never mind who it was. _Somebody_ told--that's enough.
Sid, there's only one person in this town mean enough to do that, and
that's you. If you had been in Huck's place you'd 'a' sneaked down the
hill and never told anybody on the robbers. You can't do any but mean
things, and you can't bear to see anybody praised for doing good ones.
There--no thanks, as the widow says--and Tom cuffed Sid's ears and helped
him to the door with several kicks. Now go and tell auntie if you
dare--and tomorrow you'll catch it!
Some minutes later the widow's guests were at the supper-table, and a
dozen children were propped up at little side-tables in the same room,
after the fashion of that country and that day. At the proper time Mr.
Jones made his little speech, in which he thanked the widow for the
honor she was doing himself and his sons, but said that there was
another person whose modesty--
And so forth and so on. He sprung his secret about Huck's share in
the adventure in the finest dramatic manner he was master of, but the
surprise it occasioned was largely counterfeit and not as clamorous and
effusive as it might have been under happier circumstances. However,
the widow made a pretty fair show of astonishment, and heaped so many
compliments and so much gratitude upon Huck that he almost forgot
the nearly intolerable discomfort of his new clothes in the entirely
intolerable discomfort of being set up as a target for everybody's gaze
and everybody's laudations.
The widow said she meant to give Huck a home under her roof and have him
educated; and that when she could spare the money she would start him in
business in a modest way. Tom's chance was come. He said:
Huck don't need it. Huck's rich.
Nothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company kept
back the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant joke. But
the silence was a little awkward. Tom broke it:
Huck's got money. Maybe you don't believe it, but he's got lots of it.
Oh, you needn't smile--I reckon I can show you. You just wait a minute.
Tom ran out of doors. The company looked at each other with a perplexed
interest--and inquiringly at Huck, who was tongue-tied.
Sid, what ails Tom? said Aunt Polly. He--well, there ain't ever any
making of that boy out. I never--
Tom entered, struggling with the weight of his sacks, and Aunt Polly
did not finish her sentence. Tom poured the mass of yellow coin upon the
table and said:
There--what did I tell you? Half of it's Huck's and half of it's mine!
The spectacle took the general breath away. All gazed, nobody spoke for
a moment. Then there was a unanimous call for an explanation. Tom said
he could furnish it, and he did. The tale was long, but brimful of
interest. There was scarcely an interruption from any one to break the
charm of its flow. When he had finished, Mr. Jones said:
I thought I had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion, but it
don't amount to anything now. This one makes it sing mighty small, I'm
willing to allow.
The money was counted. The sum amounted to a little over twelve thousand
dollars. It was more than any one present had ever seen at one time
before, though several persons were there who were worth considerably
more than that in property.
CHAPTER XXXV
THE reader may rest satisfied that Tom's and Huck's windfall made a
mighty stir in the poor little village of St. Petersburg. So vast a
sum, all in actual cash, seemed next to incredible. It was talked
about, gloated over, glorified, until the reason of many of the citizens
tottered under the strain of the unhealthy excitement. Every haunted
house in St. Petersburg and the neighboring villages was dissected,
plank by plank, and its foundations dug up and ransacked for hidden
treasure--and not by boys, but men--pretty grave, unromantic men, too,
some of them. Wherever Tom and Huck appeared they were courted, admired,
stared at. The boys were not able to remember that their remarks had
possessed weight before; but now their sayings were treasured and
repeated; everything they did seemed somehow to be regarded as
remarkable; they had evidently lost the power of doing and saying
commonplace things; moreover, their past history was raked up and
discovered to bear marks of conspicuous originality. The village paper
published biographical sketches of the boys.
The Widow Douglas put Huck's money out at six per cent., and Judge
Thatcher did the same with Tom's at Aunt Polly's request. Each lad had
an income, now, that was simply prodigious--a dollar for every weekday in
the year and half of the Sundays. It was just what the minister got--no,
it was what he was promised--he generally couldn't collect it. A dollar
and a quarter a week would board, lodge, and school a boy in those old
simple days--and clothe him and wash him, too, for that matter.
Judge Thatcher had conceived a great opinion of Tom. He said that no
commonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out of the cave. When
Becky told her father, in strict confidence, how Tom had taken her
whipping at school, the Judge was visibly moved; and when she pleaded
grace for the mighty lie which Tom had told in order to shift that
whipping from her shoulders to his own, the Judge said with a fine
outburst that it was a noble, a generous, a magnanimous lie--a lie that
was worthy to hold up its head and march down through history breast to
breast with George Washington's lauded Truth about the hatchet! Becky
thought her father had never looked so tall and so superb as when he
walked the floor and stamped his foot and said that. She went straight
off and told Tom about it.
Judge Thatcher hoped to see Tom a great lawyer or a great soldier some
day. He said he meant to look to it that Tom should be admitted to the
National Military Academy and afterward trained in the best law school
in the country, in order that he might be ready for either career or
both.
Huck Finn's wealth and the fact that he was now under the Widow Douglas'
protection introduced him into society--no, dragged him into it, hurled
him into it--and his sufferings were almost more than he could bear. The
widow's servants kept him clean and neat, combed and brushed, and they
bedded him nightly in unsympathetic sheets that had not one little spot
or stain which he could press to his heart and know for a friend. He had
to eat with a knife and fork; he had to use napkin, cup, and plate;
he had to learn his book, he had to go to church; he had to talk so
properly that speech was become insipid in his mouth; whithersoever he
turned, the bars and shackles of civilization shut him in and bound him
hand and foot.
He bravely bore his miseries three weeks, and then one day turned up
missing. For forty-eight hours the widow hunted for him everywhere in
great distress. The public were profoundly concerned; they searched high
and low, they dragged the river for his body. Early the third morning
Tom Sawyer wisely went poking among some old empty hogsheads down behind
the abandoned slaughter-house, and in one of them he found the refugee.
Huck had slept there; he had just breakfasted upon some stolen odds and
ends of food, and was lying off, now, in comfort, with his pipe. He was
unkempt, uncombed, and clad in the same old ruin of rags that had made
him picturesque in the days when he was free and happy. Tom routed him
out, told him the trouble he had been causing, and urged him to go home.
Huck's face lost its tranquil content, and took a melancholy cast. He
said:
Don't talk about it, Tom. I've tried it, and it don't work; it don't
work, Tom. It ain't for me; I ain't used to it. The widder's good to me,
and friendly; but I can't stand them ways. She makes me get up just
at the same time every morning; she makes me wash, they comb me all
to thunder; she won't let me sleep in the woodshed; I got to wear them
blamed clothes that just smothers me, Tom; they don't seem to any air
git through 'em, somehow; and they're so rotten nice that I can't
set down, nor lay down, nor roll around anywher's; I hain't slid on a
cellar-door for--well, it 'pears to be years; I got to go to church
and sweat and sweat--I hate them ornery sermons! I can't ketch a fly in
there, I can't chaw. I got to wear shoes all Sunday. The widder eats by
a bell; she goes to bed by a bell; she gits up by a bell--everything's so
awful reg'lar a body can't stand it.
Well, everybody does that way, Huck.
Tom, it don't make no difference. I ain't everybody, and I can't
_stand_ it. It's awful to be tied up so. And grub comes too easy--I don't
take no interest in vittles, that way. I got to ask to go a-fishing;
I got to ask to go in a-swimming--dern'd if I hain't got to ask to do
everything. Well, I'd got to talk so nice it wasn't no comfort--I'd got
to go up in the attic and rip out awhile, every day, to git a taste
in my mouth, or I'd a died, Tom. The widder wouldn't let me smoke;
she wouldn't let me yell, she wouldn't let me gape, nor stretch, nor
scratch, before folks-- [Then with a spasm of special irritation and
injury]--And dad fetch it, she prayed all the time! I never see such a
woman! I _had_ to shove, Tom--I just had to. And besides, that school's
going to open, and I'd a had to go to it--well, I wouldn't stand _that_,
Tom. Looky-here, Tom, being rich ain't what it's cracked up to be. It's
just worry and worry, and sweat and sweat, and a-wishing you was dead
all the time. Now these clothes suits me, and this bar'l suits me, and
I ain't ever going to shake 'em any more. Tom, I wouldn't ever got into
all this trouble if it hadn't 'a' ben for that money; now you just take
my sheer of it along with your'n, and gimme a ten-center sometimes--not
many times, becuz I don't give a dern for a thing 'thout it's tollable
hard to git--and you go and beg off for me with the widder.
Oh, Huck, you know I can't do that. 'Tain't fair; and besides if you'll
try this thing just a while longer you'll come to like it.
Like it! Yes--the way I'd like a hot stove if I was to set on it long
enough. No, Tom, I won't be rich, and I won't live in them cussed
smothery houses. I like the woods, and the river, and hogsheads, and
I'll stick to 'em, too. Blame it all! just as we'd got guns, and a cave,
and all just fixed to rob, here this dern foolishness has got to come up
and spile it all!
Tom saw his opportunity--
Lookyhere, Huck, being rich ain't going to keep me back from turning
robber.
No! Oh, good-licks; are you in real dead-wood earnest, Tom?
Just as dead earnest as I'm sitting here. But Huck, we can't let you
into the gang if you ain't respectable, you know.
Huck's joy was quenched.
Can't let me in, Tom? Didn't you let me go for a pirate?
Yes, but that's different. A robber is more high-toned than what a
pirate is--as a general thing. In most countries they're awful high up in
the nobility--dukes and such.
Now, Tom, hain't you always ben friendly to me? You wouldn't shet me
out, would you, Tom? You wouldn't do that, now, _would_ you, Tom?
Huck, I wouldn't want to, and I _don't_ want to--but what would people
say? Why, they'd say, 'Mph! Tom Sawyer's Gang! pretty low characters in
it!' They'd mean you, Huck. You wouldn't like that, and I wouldn't.
Huck was silent for some time, engaged in a mental struggle. Finally he
said:
Well, I'll go back to the widder for a month and tackle it and see if I
can come to stand it, if you'll let me b'long to the gang, Tom.
All right, Huck, it's a whiz! Come along, old chap, and I'll ask the
widow to let up on you a little, Huck.
Will you, Tom--now will you? That's good. If she'll let up on some of
the roughest things, I'll smoke private and cuss private, and crowd
through or bust. When you going to start the gang and turn robbers?
Oh, right off. We'll get the boys together and have the initiation
tonight, maybe.
Have the which?
Have the initiation.
What's that?
It's to swear to stand by one another, and never tell the gang's
secrets, even if you're chopped all to flinders, and kill anybody and
all his family that hurts one of the gang.
That's gay--that's mighty gay, Tom, I tell you.
Well, I bet it is. And all that swearing's got to be done at midnight,
in the lonesomest, awfulest place you can find--a ha'nted house is the
best, but they're all ripped up now.
Well, midnight's good, anyway, Tom.
Yes, so it is. And you've got to swear on a coffin, and sign it with
blood.
Now, that's something _like_! Why, it's a million times bullier than
pirating. I'll stick to the widder till I rot, Tom; and if I git to be
a reg'lar ripper of a robber, and everybody talking 'bout it, I reckon
she'll be proud she snaked me in out of the wet.
CONCLUSION
SO endeth this chronicle. It being strictly a history of a _boy_, it
must stop here; the story could not go much further without becoming the
history of a _man_. When one writes a novel about grown people, he knows
exactly where to stop--that is, with a marriage; but when he writes of
juveniles, he must stop where he best can.
Most of the characters that perform in this book still live, and are
prosperous and happy. Some day it may seem worth while to take up the
story of the younger ones again and see what sort of men and women they
turned out to be; therefore it will be wisest not to reveal any of that
part of their lives at present.

MediaFire works fine, just right click the download button, and copy the link. This works because all that does is redirect you to the legitimateÔøΩdownload.
Well, it gave me 8 pieces of adware
but yeah it's not windows' fault then
With no fucking warnings in the installer
it's your fault for downloading a program with adware...
The installer was clean, I started the CPU temperature monitor
It was installing adware live
lol then you downloaded something
Yes, I downloaded a legit CPU temperature monitoring tool that Bing was adveritising as being the best one
nooooooo
lol so you basically just clicked on an ad and you expect it to NOT HAVE ADWARE?

Yes

Take the advice of Richard Stallman
Your malware is not the CPU Temp program
Your malware is Windows
It is
Well, true
But tell that to Aviv
I have
Many times
And?
But for someone who uses windows (Aviv)
lol the adware is from CoreTemp's installer, ThePhoneKeeper
He seems to get less viruses than you
;P
Cool
This is the first time in 5 years I get adware
That's because I look things up before I download things from bing ads :)
Brb in 2 mins
kek Aviv
Aviv, my CPU was at 90C
Is that what the adware told you?
lol
:P
Exactly
ThePhoneKeeper: you could just use the built in Windows tool
What tool?
Exactly
Bing didn't tell me about a built in tool either...
Exactly there really should be one
Indeed
Also, I haven't used Windows in over 4 months
omg
So I kinda forgot how to not get adware
lol
I'm back and ad free
Just because you say that doesn't mean I'll sleep with you
I'm gonna go to sleep

If you put a space, it ignores it

Nullz, how's your game engine going?
Almost done with tilemap. Please note that this isn't a simple tilemap though :p
Nice
Does it have layers and such?
Yes
and multiple tilesets.
Only issue I see right now is, if one tile has 3 layers and if one layer is tilesheet 1 and the other one is tilesheet 2 itll set both layers to ether be tilesheet 1 or 2
Hi [mobile]splitty and [sleep]splitty_ and bacon and Aviv and ChanServ and bacon and ThePhoneKeeper!

So why no source code?
Are you up for that challenge?
Yes
because it is derpy source code

hi Nullz
Hello.
YAY Nullz IS HERE
woo
so you still workin' on your challenge?
..what challenge?
How do you know about the challenge?
Aviv: I am going to comment it a lot so that way you can start to learn C#
OH you were talking to Reagan
Hello Reagan.
oh great Reagan
All heil!
woo
I got my ¬°done better
¬°!¬°!
now it works properly
Aviv your learning C#?
No!
?:/
You know..
C# is more microsoft than Visual basic..
Nullz: no
Jus tno
lol that doesn't matter to me, Nullz
*Just
C# and Visual BASIC are both completely Microsoft
Why? Look up the history of Visual Basic(well Basic at the time.) it wasn't made by microsoft.
Errrr
It was paid to be made by microsoft
The version that we have
Is made by them
VB6 has some roots in what I would call the old basic
√°ll done
Visual Basic is still derived from Basic.
hence, the Basic part in Visual Basic
But they MUST have completely redone it to make it compile for the .NET runtime, something that wasn't around when BASIC was originally developed :P
n√≥
y√°y it is fun!
¬ønow I can do this!
C# is more of a manly language though
^
C# is more logical
And it is totally OOP
ok great
Also, reagan you know IronPython, IronRuby(and I'm sure theres another IronLanguage), NLua, and csscript? Those are all things that I can put into my application and have my application use them.
nope
I can't seem to find one for visual basic.
define one
What do you mean
I can't seem to find a visual basic execution engine.
All of the things above ^ are things that will allow my Game Engine to use that language.
Reagan:
how is the challenge?
Done
Oh?
Uploading a gist
k
ok
https://gist.github.com/JacobMisirian/4a9007bb30238077e3bc
aww Tel Aviv has its own namespace
Now that's not actually the most efficient way to do it
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fk49wtc1%28v=vs.110%29.aspx
does C# not even have block comments?
lol
It does
ok
I just prefer //
lol I know what switches and for loops are
But not in C#...
The syntax is different from the witch chants of VB
lol I have never used a switch in vb
PHP switches and C# switches are identical so it seems
also do you need to break on the default case?
oh ok you don't according to internet
but yeah thanks Reagan
Wait I am missing my break?
Nope
default:                                                         result += userInput[x].ToString();                                                         break;
No
I was saying you don't need to break the default
Refer to: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/06tc147t.aspx
default:         Console.WriteLine(Default case);         break;

no

I'm looking at twitter
Wow
You should make your own twitter
In PHP!
Wow;
You like that idea
Wow;
I dotn want to learn php;
What do you know then?
See sharp?
ACTUALLY
I THINK I CAN DO THAT
HOLY SHIT
A bit of java, A little more than a bit of Python, C#(not all of it), and I want to lean C and C++
Aviv: wanna help me make something like twitter?
Rae: You'll find PHP is C# with no types and more dollar signs
Uhm ok rae
Here's my idea for the backend
The dollar signs are my favorite part of PHP lol
For now let's just ignore user signups and say that we've already got users
Perhaps a channel for this?
Each user has a file in the system containing all of their tels (twitter messages)
Guys we need to make it Rowan Blanchard & Sabrina Carpenter themed.
/join #tels
Guys we need to make it Rowan Blanchard & Sabrina Carpenter themed.
Why does each user have a file? Lol
That will be optional
Actually
It would likely be best for each user to have a special file

Interesting.
Hi bacon
submitted a message.
I am doing my first webdev
Congrats, what language?
oh
PHP
Yeah
I'm an idiot, it's right there.
Haha.
lele
Can you help me with some code
Sure!
PHP was my first language
I am trying to read a file and iterate over the contents
The C# code would look like:
string[] contents = File.ReadAllLines(path);
iterate based on what?
lines
ah
for (int x = 0; x < contents.Length; x++)
{
console.Write(contents[x]);
}
That's it
Well, here's what I would do.
https://php.net/manual/en/function.fgets.php
bacon: http://pastebin.com/DeKEavkt
That's my current code
http://misiriansoft.com/tel/board.php
do this:
That just prints the one line at the top
You'll need to open a file descriptor.
$file_handle = fopen(file, xx);
Ok
xx should be the permissions.
Like
read, write.
hmmm
That's not *really* the issue
You'll only need r
It can read data.txt
Then you'll need to use fgets.
so
Why isn't the current one working though?
Isn't that all valid syntax
I'll have a look soon.
while(($buffer = fgets($file_handle, 4096)) !== false) {
This will read the current line and place it in a 4096-sized array.
buffer*
count.
What does count do?
Yeah.
count should get the length of the array
Yeah, I just looked it up.
Ok
is file returning false?
IDK
Oh.
Shit.
count() works
for ($x = 0; x <
I just verified that
OG
*OH
for ($x = 0; $x < count($contents);
Yeah.
yeah
+1 bacon
I just realized that.
http://misiriansoft.com/tel/data.txt
You need a new line!
I know!
how do you echo multiple strings
That I'm not actually bacon wasn't me, I assure you /s
echo test + test
.
echo test.test
Ah
I think
It's been awhile.
Why is PHP so weird
Haha, I like some of it's syntax.
err the . didn't work

However, I can think of a better one.

xDDDD
He's probably literally just putting it all into a file and echoing that out
http://misiriansoft.com/tel/data.txt
Obviously without escaping
Ah
I figured that out when the SQLi's didn't do anything (And I highly doubt Reagan is competent enough to use prepared statements)
I was hoping he was directly appending shit to board.php

Haha.
It was hacked via a file sharing service implemented by the webserver's operator (not the owner)
Apparently someone exploited a file upload thing and defaced it?
intelloTech did yes, stole the database too.
Sqlite
Did you hear what happened to http://osnetwork.ga/ ?
Nope
.htaccess would have solved this issue though.
The database was stolen and like 6 passwords were vulnerable to dictionary attack
bacon's password is like a 30 character string.
lol
I spent 2 hours figuring out what was happening in my project and all i did was forget to set a variable in the constructor.
Done that.
It's also fun when you do a property like:
public string Name {
get { return this.Name; }
}
Overflow! :p I actually did that like two times in a row last night xD
Haha, a possible method for fixing this would be to use Visual Studio's function for creating a property, but I prefer to create it manually.
Visual studio has an option to just do it for you....
bacon, last night at 3
Fuck
Last night at 3 AM I had 81 updates to do on my Winblows

With Windows Phone tools, like emulators.
No

Visual Studio 2015 has a slow compiler compared to the old ones

QUIT YOUR COMPLAINING
I am not complaining, I am giving my own opinion on something
If you dislike free speech, then don't advertise it with your love for GPL
Careful, Viperidae's a dictator.
The last romanian dictator was assassinated
So Viperidae should be careful about dictatorship...
He won't be assassinated because he will kill himself before that happens.
Viperidae, literally killed Viperidae, which invalidates the negative.
CHANSERV HAS BEEN OVERTHROWN

I.e. win the game in probably under 5 minutes from leaving the sewers
I know that Mr. Viperidae likes Skyrim
I want to get him back into it
Nah.... I'm trying to not waste my time with games
Augment: I seem to own Just Cause 2 with all the DLCs
Just Cause 3 will be a game I buy
Why the fuck did I ever add Giovanni in my steam firend's list...
Just why...

My computer most likely wont be able to run it keeper.
Thats why i dont get all the new games
That's why I have a console, because I ain't got time for that shit and I'm going to run Windows on this comptuer

Nullz: Do you have a dual core, 2 GB of RAM and a 256+ MB graphics card?
https://www.g2a.com/payday-2-steam-cd-key-global.html < you could get it for $8
I dont have a dedicated gpu
its onboard
You're fucked then
They aren't that expensive
I have about 4 of them laying randomly all over my house
I have 8gb of ram though, and a super fast(in ghz) single core with a extra thread
Oh god... What's your definition of super fast?
The actual cpu isn't fast :p But if it had more than a single core, it would be pretty great.
I have it overclocked to 4.2 ghz right now.
Interesting, my main PC has a six-core AMD at 2.9 GHz. But, I can't touch it for the next two months or so
That's really fast :/ (Excluding the fact that it only has one core)
Hahahah scrubs, I have a 6 core 3.4 GHz processor
3.9
I'm an idiot
i7 5820k?
six-core 3.9 GHz
An AMD FX 6350
Viper?
I have AMD hardware
I know keeper, because you said AMD :p
I think he has a six-core, the 3600 actually
I have a shitty graphics card, but I don't really care
6300*
Since I don't use Windows
I CANNOT WRITE TODAY FUCK!
and don't game on this
So, I have the 6350, Viperidae has the 6300
https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Darin2000/saved/qMDQzy . Will be changing GPU to 290x/380x/390x depending on release dates and prices at the time.
At school we have like crazy 16 core processors
Xeons?
I think so
I'm not sure though
But those shouldn't work well on none server machines
All I know is we have like 16 core processors and 16 gigs of RAM xD
As they are multiple cores at a low clock rate
We have 1000000 core processors at my school, you're so outdated, Viperidae.
TheWindowsKeeper: It's like 2.6 GHz or something
Which honestly, isn't terrible.
Wow.
Most Xeon CPUs aren't that fast
or 2.4
1.8-2.2 is their range
2.something
Keeper, as long as the software uses more than 1 core it should be fine, and the ones that dont likely dont need more than a 2ghz core xD
^
Honestly, I think that speed is great
until you factor in how much xeons cost.
But my school division payed for it...
*paid
Well yeah
To be fair, Xeons are built for servers, and reliability is a factor in the price.
Well, bacon I think the reason we use them is so we can have numerous VMWare instances running
Viperidae: Also, Xeons are good for their support of ECC memory
Yeah, I would assume though, I am going out now to the shops, talk soon.
TheWindowsKeeper, yup.

Wait what?
A shell file?
Yes
Does it have the runtime in it?
A simple .sh file has 2.7 GB
I have no idea, it's still downloading

Holy shit.
Well, there are Android IDEs for that
XCode is one of the greatest IDEs out there.
Right
Well, I can write Android apps directly on my phone
Likewise with my iPod.
Did I say how much I hate Windows?
And that last night at 4 AM it wanted to do 81 updates?
Yup, I've had 170 updates before.
Windows is horrible!
Worst invention in the world... why does it still exist?
It's not as bad as you say it is.
Is it not?
It's just doesn't compare with Linux.
Up until now, it made me a very bad impression... So, I went from Windows to Linux
Didn't touch Windows in ~4 months
And then went back to Windows for a bit
It's horrible.
Just... no.
I haven't used Windows for a year, but I had to go back to it for school.
I'm loving Windows 8.1, apart from searching for apps with the Modern UI shit.
It's weird
Windows 10 looks horrible in my opinion but I say that about everything.
Even VS 2010!
Then Visual 2012.
Haha
https://developer.apple.com/xcode/images/xcode-games.png
That looks amazing.
Apple is an evil company
^^
Viperidae, what web browser do you use?
Chrome
Google makes Chrome, correct?
The company which values user's private data more than the moral and ethical business model, just because makes more money?
Yes, I honestly think Google is more ethical than Apple/Microsoft
I think that having DRM rights built into software like iOS is evil
That doesn't justifies 'evil' in my opinion. I thought you were referring to it's patenting and tax evasion.
No, I'm talking about their policy of systemically infringing on the freedom of their users through BSD jails, coding signing,  ect.
That systematical violation increases the security of the device.
At what cost? Prohibiting me from running from own open source code on a vanilla device without paying Apple $100?
That just ain't right
That is evil and it prohibits developers from poorer countries. You should be able to place your device into a 'developer mode'. However, that doesn't justifies evil.
The code signing prevents malicious applications from installing itself onto your device through exploitation of the host computer, because the application will not be able to run.
The code signing prevents users from installing malicious applications disguised as paid applications (which affects the jailbreak community).
I think this dwarfs in comparison to the moral violations brought upon by Facebook and Google. The ability to know everything about you in order to 'increase convenience'. The inescapable world of opt-out (by installing third-party code) to advertisements, which tries to use it's information it knows about you to try to target the advertisement directly towards you, which means you constantly see the same advertisements.
It just doesn't affect you on Google's own website, but the entire web.
Every G+ like button, every embedded YouTube video, every advertisement.
However, Google is a great company too, because the software they make are amazing.
I use Chrome.
I use Android.
Viperidae, I take it back.
Apple is an evil company.
They renamed Yosemite.
El Capitan.
Viperidae, what is sexyjester?
Chanserv
afaik
bacon: Code signing to prevent malicious code should be optional. Forcing it is like having the NSA send an agent to everyones home to verify they are not terrorists. With security, you loose freedom. Android allows you to turn off code signing, but its enabled by default
bacon what's wrong with El Capitan :D
Viperidae, you lose freedom regardless of if it's configurable.
Anyway.
I think they're changing this.

Reagan: http://store.steampowered.com/app/370360/
Game about programming in assembly
Can't view it here sorry
WITCH!!!
?
I am at school
Who cares if you're at school?
Pull up your phone and surf to the game
Also, school is for nubz
I only have 3 days left
Well good for you
TheWindowsKeeper, Reagan, Viperidae
Yes
I just implemented fixed-length and incremental bruteforce
Reagan you can now try to bruteforce JHashes :D
Yay!
lecter -m jhash -i hashes.txt --incremental
:D
Nice
Nice
splitty__, check that game out
So /me forgot to sanitize input from the text box
SQLi :D
Not SQL
XSS
Viperidae *cough cough* used it to inject Javascript
Not XSS
PHP eval?
It's just the php echos the contents of the file
So it was echoing:
<script>alert(gtd is the best);</script>
Can I see?
lol
I deleted it...
You fucker...
Now I am sanitizing *pretty* well
mysql_real_escape_string()?
mysql_real_escape_string is not well. x
I love how they made a new function because myslq_escape_string sucks
PDO + Prepared statements
$invalid_characters = array($, %, #, <, >, |);
$str = str_replace($invalid_characters,  , $message);
WTF REAGAN
Interesting idea
Don't do this.
Why?
Maybe because Uncode characters?
Unicode*
oh shite
One can simply emulate < or >
Even &lt; or &gt; could work
Can you try that in just a second
sure
pming you
Reagan: http://puu.sh/iidfV/e9fcbc0d25.png
errr can't see
why
Just look at your board
school web filtering
Message: <script>alert('test');</script>
I see it
xD
It doesn't work though xD
Like it's not executing
Well I don't know what the backend code looks light
Although it is horridly incomplete
And more of a test than an application
But whatever
Oh I know why it doesn't work
wtf post.php was not found on this server
What did you do Reagan
https://github.com/JacobMisirian/TelBoard
Oh shit
I did mv
Not cp
xDD
Nothing works
There we go
Reagan: http://misiriansoft.com/tel/board.php
Goddamn it
:P
So how should I sanitize it
Hahaha
Reagan refresh
wut?
Yeah. I deleted the file.
huh
I can delete files on your system by injecting document.write('<?php unlink(/path/to/file); ?>');
Please no
I just deleted the data.txt
So how do I sanitize
As you can see, all my javascript injection stuff is gone
mysqli_real_escape_string
But you'll need a database connection for that
errrr
You can use mysql_escape_string without a database
But it's much less safe
Why?
There's functions for XSS-shit.
However.
There's no single function.
echo htmlspecialchars($string, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');
htmlspecialchars won't help you
Either <> or &gt; or &#60; will work xD
What will
Nothing.
I gtg
plz dont haxx me
The only thing you can do it real_escape it
kk
XSS is such a major problem, because the solutions which are supposed to help, don't fully help.
Template engines are useful for preventing XSS.
I could delete reagons /etc/shadows file
lol
NikxDa's here?
or did you link it to him?
I told him to try showing a message to test his haxx0r skills :D
Haha
Yo bacon
We completely destroyed his website

I like your new board
I really do
Reagan

xDDDD
fucking fuk
You fuked up
Well now it
's not going to echo anything
You children have lost your TelBoard privileges
:/
splitty__: how to sanitize this shit
Think about it
As I said. Use a database instead of a file and use PDO + Prepared Statements
Then do it
WTF HE'S USING A FILE?
Yeah data.txt
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
I deleted it before you started having fun with the site
I have not worked with DBs in over a year
By injecting php tags and unlink xD
Well. It's time to learn it then. xD
And even then it was with a cutsie interface
splitty__, nikxda: you do understanding he's learning right, this is not an official application, there's no warrant to be outrage by the use of files.
There is
It's like creating a chat via FTP
It's bullshit no matter what
Right bacon. But he is writing crap code for a long time now and he really needs to improve it
:|
Also, he wants to sanitize it. If he wants to do it the right way, he should do it the right way. xD
!rep give splitty__
I am looking up some database articles
Not too hard actually
https://www.rosehosting.com/blog/basic-mysql-database-administration-on-a-linux-vps/
TheWindowsKeeper! We need a hero (Cheesoid)!
I'm on Windows
Look at my name
Install python. xD
Cheesoid's on Linux
Damn
Can't access it
Right, there's a clear difference between a ftp chat and using a flat file for a databse.
You can.
database*
I don't want more adware
Ye there is, one is a chat, the other one is a database, both is shit.
TheWindowsKeeper: http://www.paragon-software.com/home/extfs-windows/index.html
That's an ext driver for Windows
You'll be able to access your files
Too lazy
I'll do it in a bit
nikxda, using files for learning is not bad, in fact... in 2007 I did the same thing.
Yeah. In 2007. When you were 9 or something. lol
12
How old is Reagan?
It's not about age.
Yeah ik, just wanted to make clear that 15/16 year old people don't do this anymore
It's about the knowledge of the environment.
Yeah. But he is programming for quite some time now
In PHP?
I worked with files 2 times. One was my first ever project, the second one was because I was unable to make use of Databases due to limitations of my boss.
Reagan had like 30 projects
It does NOT matter which language
More like 50
You should know that you need to use DBs
Last time I used plaintext for storing things was when I was 9, about 7 years ago
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING MAN
^^
!rep give TheWindowsKeeper
bacon: this is my first experience with php, yes
Cheesoid is still not here.
Let's just ignore the fact that good ol' Cheesoid is not here
Reagan I really hope that you don't try to force anal sex on your first girlfriend just because it's your first time and you don't know it better
:|
There's nothing insecure about using files for flat storage, databases require more knowledge. It will not solve the XSS problem.
That was....an analogy
xDD
It's okay to do something wrong the first time you do it. But it's not okay to say I don't know anything about databases instead of just looking it up and learning it.
There's a learning curve, first you must understand the language.
It's not exactly wrong.
Look at his code. He understood the language. He's properly opening and closing file handles, etc
It's not ideal for production applications, but it's not wrong.
and.
He has worked with C# before, file descriptions is not a PHP-feature.
It
The thing is that he wanted me to try hacking it and that he now just changed the board to just not load our injected shit instead of solving the problem
's cute how you fight over me
I know right, sweetie
splitty__: I want to make it secure
That's why I'm going to use databases
Yeah. It will be as secure as it can get with databases. xD
Really?
And if you properly prepare your statements.
But the CLI is really shitty
XSS still affects database applications.
bacon: it is easier to sanitize though
splitty__: MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE DATABASE db_Tel     ->      ->
It doesn't...worlk
*work
CREATE DATABASE db_tel;
I enter in the proper command and it just displays that weird prompt
Yeah. But I think we all agree that using a database is way more secure and easy than just trying to sanitize the input and redirecting it to a file
Yeah because you forgot to end it using a semicolon;
You can have persistent xss attacks.
which are stored in a database.
Yeah. You can also detonate a nuclear bomb in your basement.
Sure, databases are vulnerable too.
Everything is vulnerable.
But the amount of security that you get with properly handling a database is MUCH higher than the amount of security you get with trying to store everything in a file.
You can imagine the file as just a storage engine, you'll still need to prevent XSS with that.
Yeah. But it's harder to prevent XSS with that.
It's not harder, it's just the PHP developers didn't do a good job.
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_%28XSS%29
I would recommend you read this.
(Reagan)
I will
And I am very familiar with XSS
Then

bacon: I'm finding Windows to be more or less a usable system
It doesn't compare with Linux, but it works
sorta
Yup.
I get that too.
I find it hard to use because of the DOS-based console.
Cygwin makes it usable for me.
I keep writing ls instead of dir
And it's driving me nuts
I know exactly how you mean.
Is there an alias command?
I don't think so.
I think gitscm for windows provides ls and whatnot.
And also, the freaking backslashes man...
Why backslash?
Yeah bacon, gitscm provided ls and some other stuff
splitty__, does it implant itself into the HOME var?
PATH*
Yeah. You can choose if it itegreates into the cmd or not.
integrates*
That's good.
I hate how cygwin doesn't have a built in package manager.
The setup.exe is horrible.

Despite my sickness, I'm going to eat mudcake, be right back.
splitty_: Should I try and write a whole game test in pure IronPython?
Dunno :D
Oh yeah.
TheWindowsKeeper, I hated the PyCharms logo.
I wanted to find a different one.
and I found this:
https://github.com/dr-slash/icons-flat-osx
There's a PyCharms one.
https://github.com/dr-slash/icons-flat-osx/blob/master/Applications/Jetbrains-PyCharm.png

Whoa that looks nice
It looks a lot like Korora's
But Korora's is better

Awesome
I really want to make a custom project type for my game engine, and a Visual Studio plugin module thinger
Hey Augment
splitty_: Would it be a good idea?
Yeah sure
MonoGame does that too
I don't really know how though...
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/s365byhx%28v=vs.100%29.aspx
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xkh1wxd8.aspx
splitty_: I was about to mention MonoGame's.
:D
Guess what.
I still have not gotten my mudcake.
brb.
:o
Enjoy your mudcake
But for now, I'll live without
It's too early in development to add something like that
Or is it not?
You can always just modify the template if anything drastically changes
I want to add a custom project for content and such
splitty_: Is there some info on how to do things with custom file types?
And normal files
For example, I drag a file in it and it copies it to the appropriate folder
MariaDB [db_Tel]> SELECT * FROM messages     -> ; +----------+----------------+ | nickname | message        | +----------+----------------+ | John     | This is a test | +----------+----------------+
How the content project works in MonoGame and such
YAY
TheWindowsKeeper, there is none.
They use a custom application.
You add the contents to that and build a file.
TheWindowsKeeper, just read the links I've sent you
And you shouldn't use custom extensions
I know
And nice Reagan
I just want something like: I drag a png inside the project, it puts it in the right folder
Like, when you compile
It puts things in an assets folder or something
The documentation for nested projects sucks
He

Hello.

Aurora01: Cheesoid's broken on Windows
No commands work
And no errors are thrown
The log is clean
Step 1: Which Cheesoid version
?
The one I use on Linux
Step 2: Which Twisted version do you have?
The same exact one, copied
Latest for 2.7.10
It connects
But no commands work
Check the log and stdout for anything and pastebin
Nothing in the log or stdout
As I said, it's as clean as possible

Yes?
How long should it take to bruteforce a string with a length of 6 letters using a 26 letter alphabet?
26**6
worst case
Yeah ikr that's roughly 1.7e+20
Yeah
But how long should it take in minutes?
Took hashlecter 21 minutes
I feel like that's a bit too long
Well, depends on hardware speed
And on implementation speed
I haven't looked at your MD5, but there might be ways to optimise it
Well my algorithm doesn't use parallelization yet
If you run it on the NSA's servers, expect it to be done before you asked.
And I'm using the .NET implementation of MD5
If you run it on your potato, expect about 10 hours
I heard that the BouncyCastle one is slower than the .NET one
u can crack my md5 ;)
lol
How about I md5 your crack?
My hash is better than my crack
Unity can bake lighting, but no hash brownies
lol
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
Wouldn't it be easier to call a fast, C implementation splitty_?
Probably yes. :D
But I have no idea how fast or slow it is to invoke C code using a .net language
And I would need to use an implementation that I can ship safely with hashlecter
Well, if you just call it and collect its stdout, it shouldn't be that slow
And
you could make it extensible really easy that way
Just provide a standard that all the C hash implementation have to fit, and you can just have a directory of the implementations or whatever
hmm
im extendable *wink*
Descant apparently is 61% JS
Such a lovely language

Aurora01, what is the preferred way to include licenses of other projects?
Good god someone renamed ChanServ to sexyjester
wat do u need help with
splitty_: you can just include the license in the main repo I believe
wut
splitty_: Either include their license header in their files or just copy the main file
whos chanserv
And in the file you took it from leave the original clause
Aurora01 what if I compile something from source? Should I just add a file called projectname_license or something to my repo?
Yeah, ideally.
Depends on the license
ah okay
http://puu.sh/iippd/80013485c6.png
how u doin reagan?
bye augy
Yeah, just follow the instructions of clause 2 splitty_
So I just have to add a file containing the license + disclaimer of the project to hashlecter?
Yeah
Okay nice
It should also be possible to create a single LICENSE file and subdivide it into section for each project right?
sections*
That'd be acceptable
okay thanks

bacon: Have you seen Visual Studio 2015?
It has an amazing live diagnostic tool, it measures memory used in real time, important moments, for example when there's an exception that gets thrown but cought in a try/catch block
It's amazing
The important moment thing
That's been a feature for several versions, that's IntelliTrace right? I think you only get it in Ultimate at the moment though
It'
It's better than IntelliTrace
I'm sure the live diagnostics were also features of pro and upwards, through the performance tools
As I've used it in all prior versions
What's new?
A lot
... Any elaboration on that?
Google it, I can't focus
My brain is broken
brb
oh wait

$5000/year.
10 year minimum contract.
$10 000 000 contract termination fee.
Think I'll pass
Augment, don't you like bacon?
Depends. ...
$5 000 is only money.
bacon is bacon.
wat is money
Yeah
when bacon
do you really value currency over money.
oops.
bacon.
But it's kinda more money than I have
At all
Then, you don't like bacon.
BUT.
For you.
We'll lower the price to...
$2000/year.
Just between us.
Champ.
What do you say?
A damn done deal?
Nope
Let me just speak to my supervisor, I might be able to lower it to $10/year.
ON ANOTHER UNRELATED NOTE
Cameron: Yes Cameron, that's what I mean
Swift 2, anyone?
No? Didn't think so
Don't mind the double Cameron
How very intimate
Cameron, I love how they'll be open sourcing it.
It'd be good if MS put it in Visual Studio
I might actually bother to learn it then
Haha, I have a Macbook, but I spend more time in Linux and Windows than OS X, so it's kinda hard.
But since .NET is going cross platform, not sure I'd need to, would have to weigh up the performance benefits
Ewwww Macbooks
I still loathe Apple
splitty_: Jew here?
Haha, I wanted to run all three operating systems.
Yeah
I mean
Who needs performance?
When you have all the major desktop OSes?
brb
.
I should say this isn't the 'high-end' Macbook Pro, but it's the one where you can replace the RAM and hard drive.
(even replace the cd drive with a SSD if I wanted to)

Haha, they still sell it.
Do you have Proto's bacon alias?
Proto's bacon alias?
Yeah.
oh right, do you have a means to get into contact with Proto.
I do
I'm friends with him on Facebook and shit
i.e. proprietary platforms I am not a part of.
Skype comes to mind.
That too
I could probably drive to his uni once I've got my licence, if you need me to kill him
Um, maybe in the future.
I would like you to tell him when you next talk to him that bacon is back in black.
or.
backon.
bakon.
bakin'
I have messaged him just now
I have no bacon to give you, but I do have love.
Too bad, all my love goes to sexyjester.
I know it's Viperidae in disguise, but damn it doesn't matter.
bacon: https://github.com/chronium/ChronosEngine/blob/master/Game/GameTest.cs
Also, splitty_ look at that please
OpenGL calls are hidden now!
The user doesn't have to touch OpenGL... well, for the limited number of things the engine does now
nice
Do you like how it looks?
I'm going to implement a GUI library soon
But I first need some input hooks
Yeah TheWindowsKeeper it looks great
Yay :D
I just added SHA384, SHA512 and RIPEMD-160 support to Hashlecter
Nice, I want to start making a simple tutorial for this
Like, the first tutorial. Displaying a window
sudo get me a window
man chronosengine
chronosengine --get-window
sudo !!
Sooo... you people are now interested in this?
Nah, I'm far too busy with django.
Bed time, night.
Night bacon
Just found this guy on Twitter, he's 75 years old and signs off literally every single one of his tweets with his name and home town... https://twitter.com/BrianPilton
splitty_: Can you please help me?
Can you refine my tutorial? https://github.com/chronium/ChronosEngine/wiki/Tutorial-1
Here's the code: https://github.com/chronium/ChronosEngine/blob/master/Tutorials/FirstTutorial/Tutorial1.cs
Aurora01?
Busy, sorry.
:(
Augment?
Yeah?
I'll give credits and something to the person who can help me
I'm not familiar with the engine, haven't looked recently, but I suppose I can have a look once I shoot this zip back at tc
You just need to refine my tutorial. It's a very simple engine for now and you don't need to learn much
I... don't know what refinements to make
I feel like the tutorial is shit
And it looks bad
And it's not structured properly
TheWindowsKeeper doesn't ChronoGame implement IDisposable?
Nope
I don't dispose of anything
I feel like it should be using (var game = new Tutorial1 ()) { game.Run (); }
You should.
splitty_: Fell free to contribute
You should dispose the GL contexts and stuff
I have no idea how to OpenTK
I gladly take any pull requests
I never really worked with OpenTK
This can be your chance
It's very nice and simple to use
Like, really
Nah I'm busy with Hashlecter
Don't wanna learn OpenTK right now
Can you at least refine something related to the tutorial?
But I'll try to contribute to your wiki.
Yay :D
I never did anything to dispose things
splitty_: OpenTK does all the trashing itself
All I need to do is dispose of my things
TheWindowsKeeper: https://github.com/chronium/ChronosEngine/wiki/Tutorial-1
Amazing.
You are awesome!
Thank you :D
I owe you one
But I'll exploit you more for further tutorials
And when you're done with HashLecter, I might explpoit you a bit for my engine, if you want
Yeah sure :D
You can always ask me if you need help with something. I have enough time and I don't work on Hashlecter 24/7 :P
Nice :D
I don't wanna learn OpenTK at the moment, but I'll be happy to help you with other stuff :D
Okay
Well, if I ever exploit you. You won't have to touch OpenTK
'exploit' him, huh?

I'm going to implement Whirlpool
Hello Augment and Chronium
TheBrokenKeeper, hello
Hi
Aviv: https://github.com/chronium/ChronosEngine/wiki/Tutorial-1
By the way, Aviv, I've merged the branches now ready for v0.1 release, the frontend is in static/descant now
:O
Plus there's the *fun* job of writing documentation to do at some point
Woo!
And we should probably have some sort of static Descant promotion site
Yeah I was working on that but I got distracted lol
xD
Well, there's no rush, we've not got any deadline :P
So basically the master branch is a usable-ish product that people can install, and the backend and frontend branches are for development?
Well, what I was thinking of doing was keeping master as usable, like you say, then just creating a new branch pulled from master that's developed with
It's probably easier just to have everything in one branch rather than a front and backend branch because merging is tempremental with git sometimes
Though it could be kept in 2 separate branches if that would be easier
I'm just going to style the UCP
Yeah, that'd be great
Aviv, do you know who 'rhkdwls7787' is?
Not at all
Weird, they seem to have found and registered at the Descant forum
lol
pptosn gives ya activity just like you thought ;)
xD
Good activity is a different question, of course :P
ha ha
Bye
TheWindowsKeeper
https://github.com/SplittyDev/Hashlecter/blob/master/hashlecter/Implementations/WhirlpoolCryptoServiceProvider.cs
Finally finished my Whirlpool implementation
Amazing
Why does that look so fucking complicated?
Because it is fucking complicated. xD
Well, that was quite logical, wasn't it?
I had only the C reference implementation :/
It was pretty hard.
Well, that sucks
I don't even know if I did everything right
I'll test it in a few minutes
xD
IT WORKS
good
Yo Reagan
Hey splitty_
I just had the same thing
I implemented Whirlpool
It was not easy
xD
finally
I just made an account and authenticated  with Tel
finally
What's a whirlpool?
:D
lol
A cryptographic hashing method
duh
512-bits
woah
Take a look at the source
https://github.com/SplittyDev/Hashlecter/blob/master/hashlecter/Implementations/WhirlpoolCryptoServiceProvider.cs
Dat's a wot o bits
1001 lines.
Took me two and a half hours
Wow
That's dedication
wow
^^
Let's see how fast it is
Lol Reagan not really
Hi Viperidae!!
HELLO
Viperidae: wut?
og
Two hours is dedication
Yeah!
Viperidae it was fucking hard :D
But it works, and it is fast. I love it. :D
Oh I'm sure I'm just saying if two hours is your definition of dedication than you have low standards (I'm sure we've all spend an entire day trying to do one thing and failing repeatably)
haha yeah
Night ladies
[tumbleweed]
FUCK
YOU

Night Cameron
<3
w00 md5ing in PHP
Don't use MD5
^
I'm serious
Ok
+likeovar9000
Recommendation?
BCrypt
With a decent WF, I'm not sure what the current recommendation  is IIRC
I usually use SHA256
Viperidae: The cool thing with BCrypt is that you can vary the amount of work per hash
http://php.net/manual/en/function.password-hash.php
so you get that tradeoff between performance and security
yes
or you can just use the default password_hash function
Aviv: that is BCrypt
lol I know
However that is subject to change
Reagan: Reagan, PHPass
www.openwall.com/phpass/
Yup I'm going to Bcrypt because Augment says so
PHPass is Bcrypt...
Or he could just use BCrypt and reduce the dependencies..
Ah damn it it somehow broke the entire thing :(
Reagan: https://github.com/chronium/ChronosEngine/wiki/Tutorial-1
Here's a more complete example, it draws a sprite on the screen: https://github.com/chronium/ChronosEngine/blob/master/Game/GameTest.cs
Viperidae: Do you like what splitty_ did to the tutorial on the wiki?
He made it all fancy and stuff, mine was looking bad
https://github.com/chronium/ChronosEngine/wiki/Tutorial-1/0e685147b02ee7c93332a769f426904567133f40
There, that's mine

And that's pure CSS?
I'm impressed.
yeah
it's
so
damn

Yeah TheWindowsKeeper, it looks nice
also, are you one of these guys now?
What guys?
http://static.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/1871985.jpg
I'm too bored
I can't focus
I can't program for more than 15 minutes an hour
So I decided to try out some games again
It's making my life easier
As you really don't want to know how it is in my possition
So pelase don't get one of your smart comments
Because I can /kill you right away. And don't tell me I didn't warn you
TheWindowsKeeper: it would be unwise to /kick your superior (Viperidae)
*inserts smart comment here*
^
That's why I'm killing him, not kicking him :P
*inserts something else there*
:|
And here there are no superiors
We are all equal
Living in harmony
:|
*inserts another smart comment, then says something slutty*
Flowers, rainbows and fuck life to everyone :D
I'm waiting on Reagan's *facedesk*
*RaeRae's
heyyy raerae
heeeey sexyjester
Do you have those pictures I ask for?
Who the fuck even is this sexyjester?
Augment: Viperidae's ex's screenname
Right...
I got accused last night of being a dictator.
So
I appointed someone new to be in charge
lelwut
So, this channel is now run by sexyjester
Dicktater?
Best idea ever...
As I'm apparently a dictator
[2015-06-09 09:19:38] <bacon> Careful, Viperidae's a dictator.
Proof.
+q
+q who?
CourtneyBot?
yo mama
Ok
I'm the only one using foobar2000 as my main music player?
Yes
Careful now
You don't want to do something you'll regret later
That's what she said
...
:D
Did I mention how much I love the people here?
^
Welp
Some of them
:P
xD
We are the best community out there
splitty_: in America we'd say that this community is like one big 'old married couple'
That's also a quite common idiom in Germany
Really?
Huh
Yeah
We say it's wie ein altes Ehepaar
It's quite a common idiom
err
more or less everywhere
so there's that
After all, all across the world, there are old married couples
I'm trying to get a napoleon into joining, but not sure if that napoleon has time or a working computer
a napoleon? wut
You see the users list?
There's napoleon?
oooh
wtf
ahhhhh augy left
Soo...
I want to write a GUI library and make my game
Which will only require that
Nothing more
Nullz and splitty_ have something I believe that could be useful
wats that
There's no Nullz in here afaik
https://github.com/DarinBoyer/Moonshine-GUI
That should be useful
I see how I didn't read your nullz message properly
Fuck
Well...
Umn...
Speak of the devil...
RaeRae, this code looks kinda really quite very messy...
Just a tiny bit...
It's documented
It's Nullz's code lol
Hmm?
Well, it's documented, so, it's not bad
Nullz: I recommended your library to TTK
But there needs to be a folder structure somewhere
What library..?
Nullz: https://github.com/DarinBoyer/Moonshine-GUI
Oh.
Also, Nullz: https://github.com/chronium/ChronosEngine/wiki/Tutorial-1
The tutorial was beautyfied by Mr. splitty_
I need to learn how to document stuff :p
I abuse Mono for that
The code looks awesome though.
This is a more complete example than the tutorial, it draws a sprite on the screen: https://github.com/chronium/ChronosEngine/blob/master/Game/GameTest.cs
And also loads a Python script
Well this is bothersome
When I use md5() it works perfectly
Changing it to password_hash with PASSWORD_DEFAULT it breaks
And I am changing it consistently
RaeRae: Use PHPass please
It's great for password storage
It uses either Bcrypt or Scrypt
The way you use your engine looks alot like Xna/monogame xD
Interesting
Well, this is the basic way anything would work
It's a basic framework that's perfect and it can't exactly be changed that much
Well /me is settling for sha256
Why exactly?
Yeah. Why?
Because the algorithm !works()
*the other
Bcrypt works too
lol
It broke!
nope
Like literally
It works just fine
splitty_: just listen
When I have md5($_GET[password])
Whatever you're going to tell me, I'm not going to believe it xD
or
btw, don't use GET for passwords ffs
hash(sha256, $_GET[password]);
That works
Use POST for passwords.
My friends skype account got Hacked > Hacker messages me asking who I am > Ask him how he hacked it >Backdoor/keylogger > Asks him what he wrote it in > He didnt write it, he just says a program > Give him examples of languages > He says Dracula logger > Friend got Hacked by a skid >>
GET is as secure as just using no hash at all.
Well
I'd try SHA512
But doing password_hash($_GET[password], DEFAULT_PASSWORD) does not work
Ok
sha512 it is
Or you could try PHPass?
Or, you could not
Am I like IP banned from tel or something?
Nah
Reagan just do password_hash($_GET[password], CRYPT_BCRYPT);
You need an account now, and he's not finished with that
Viperidae: sha512 works
Nullz: the login interface will work in 10 minutes
Oh I thought it was ether ip ban or it was finding words it didn't like.
bcrypt is still probably slightly better, but as long as passwords are salted, you ought to be good to go
Nullz I tried that too lol
lol
I thought he banned splitty, but when it blocked Hitler I knew that it was just broken
Why RectangleF TTK?
Rectangle, float
Exactly
ah
I need it a float
As usually, for texture indices you don't hack it like I did with my sprites and use pixels, you actually use a 0-1 value for uv and ut with texture coordinates
I said I should make it easier for the user
But I might consider going back to the good old 0-1
I need to getpaint.net now
Pirating photoshop is better..
I have 3 GB of RAM with a dual core
Paint.net is a good editor
I don't want it to blow up
Especially with plugins
Viperidae, what plugins do you usally use for it?
Lol
Well, none actually because I've never needed them
Actually
I only used a grid maker plugin
Man, foobar2000 is an amazing player
I don't know what the name of this is, but you know when textures don't have alpha and are stored in black and white with the lightness of each pixel being the amount of alpha?
lol
Umn... wat?
I have no idea what it's called
You have a black and white texture
Ah, I know now
The lighter each pixel is, the more alpha it has
Yup
Something to that effect.
That seems pretty useless to me lol
Oldie but goodie: https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat
splitty_: What do you use more, Linux or Windows?
splitty_: I've scene it used for hud textures in video games
I'm assuming the advantage of it is you can change the color to what ever you want
You've scene it used?
Oh yeah
You've *scene* it used?
*seen
And now I know what you mean by that tool
And yes, it's quite useful
TheWindowsKeeper, at the moment I use Windows more. Maybe because my grub got nuked.
Interesting
lmfao this wat
Use easyBCD to solve that
I didn't even need to reinstall GRUB
It just added an option when I once booted Windows, it got myself a dual bootloader
Now whenever I start my PC I can chose between the Winblows bootloader and GRUB
I need more wats
I proudly have done away with Windows
TheWindowsKeeper I love DestroyAllSoftware :D
Yup
It's awesome
Especially the talk about the birth and death of JavaScript
Hey...
Javascript was born the same year and month as me.
I find that offensive that you would incinerate that javascript is too of a player.

Ewww Windows 8
Windows 7 is b etter
bacon: What's better, win8.1 or 7?
Wait, he's away...
Fuck
I'm here.
Which one's better?
You know what's better than both? Neither of them.
I'm no authority on this matter, I simply am a guy with an opinion, but I've grown to prefer Windows 8.1 better than Windows 7.
For some reason I feel like Win 8.1 works better than Win 7
Windows 8.1 is faster than Windows 7
And indeed it is faster
Plus, more advanced screenshot functionality.
Or.. you could just use linux
I would actually pick 8.1 > 7 too.
bacon: You sure?
I swear you can save them to disk.
Where's the functionality?
You can save them to disk in Win7?
I feel like Xfce 4.12's is better
Paint.
The interface of Win8 is horrid.
It has an automatic button to upload to imgur
Viperidae, the only thing I don't like is the Modern UI nonsense, the rest is fine.
It looks like some half assed childrens website from the late 90s optimized for Netscape navigator, combined with a shitty VBOS for the traditional desktop
There's no point in fighting over X is better over Y, because there is literally no winner.
It's all up to opinion.
TheBrokenKeeper: http://www.softwareok.com/?seite=faq-Windows-8&faq=69
It doesn't beat your imgur button, but still handy.
(I personally use ShareX on Windows)
Well, I have puush
I use puush, it just gives me a link which I can paste anywhere :D
I don't like puush.
I prefer to build my own makeshift puush with sftp/scp
The fact that the NT kernel is a horrid piece of trash straight out of early micro computers during the 80s is an objective fact
It's also closed source.
TheBrokenKeeper: Why not just VM windows
His computer is slow (the one's he using)
RaeRae: Dual core CPU at 2.2 GHz with 3 GB of RAM
And I want to play games on it
So yeah
You only have 3GB RAM?
I thought you had a desktop
It's a piece of shit laptop, yes
I can't access my desktop PC
As I have a cast and the PC is about 18 meters away from me
I have quad core 1GHZ (whatever that means)
And 4GB RAM
Atom?
And it's a tinyass laptop
Yup
Atom
?
No?
What CPU then?
I don't get why TTK can't just remote into his other PC
Acer aspire V5-122p
AMD A6
Ah
Close enough
Viperidae, nobody can access my PC
Nobody
Except for me
It's close to biometric scanning, but not that advanced
Viperidae, and sadly in this day and age, it's impossible to live a technology nomad with fully open-source software.
Uhm
Does Quad Core 1ghz == Single Core 4ghz?
RaeRae: My desktop PC has six-core at 3.9 GHz with 8 GB of RAM
How does that work?
How it works? I have no idea how I boot my PC, but I can do it
Nobody else can
bacon: Maybe, but I always ask myself What would Stallman do
It takes about 10 reboots to boot into it XD
Does Quad Core 1ghz == Single Core 4ghz?
No.
Viperidae, rant?
^^^
Write a post on this blog.
Bingo
Haha
Rant plz
Website*
RaeRae, quad 1GHz is not close to a single 4GHz
Then
BETTER YET
To mix things up

fork...bombed fork....ed from git?
No

oh
fork is a system call.
Yes
That one
I know it had *something* to do with processes
Although, I've come close xD Thank you emergency birth control, because any children with sexyjester would be little fuck ups
Haha, now I gotta eat.
Ew.
That's a metaphor for...
masturbation.

In a sense, but with himself.
Can anyone draw some sort of a window border for me?
Now, food. I got school soon.

Yes?
sexyjester is Courtney's screenname xD

Ah.
Ah
Ah.

Did you see my whirlpool implementation?
If not: https://github.com/SplittyDev/Hashlecter/blob/master/hashlecter/Implementations/WhirlpoolCryptoServiceProvider.cs
NESSIE because cryptozoology?
Nope Whirlpool has been recommended by the NESSIE project
I prefer my reason
:D
I have no idea why, but some function are called NESSIE*, and I used the same function names.
functions*
NESSIEinit, NESSIEadd, etc

github.com/JacobMisirian/TelBoard
Simply a suggestion, but you can use HTTP to redirect
echo <script type=\text/javascript\> window.location=\http://misiriansoft.com/tel/\</script>;
wtf are you doing
instead of
header(location:/);
xD
https://github.com/JacobMisirian/TelBoard/blob/master/TelBoard/data.txt
Reagan, why are you initializing the sessions in multuple files?
error_log(0); or whatever will fix that /s
It's not to init session it's to authenticate
You should call session_start (); before any output of any kind
$enteredUsername = mysql_real_escape_string(htmlentities(htmlspecialchars(strip_tags($enteredUsername))));
wtf
Yup
Was about to point that out
prepare  statements.
Regardless, nice start.

I'm gonna go to sleep (for real) :D
Goodnight
night
Night, for me I got to get read for school.
which more like a place for me to code haha
bacon: have I mentioned how good it is to have you back
I'll sleep now
Aka, going on Linux for logs
I'll brb
He's not here!
bacon: we can say whatever without being logged!
Linux is amazing.
Now, I'll be sleeping and logging
Reagan, nope
Soo...
Now I got leave, talk when back
I need to sleep
Hvae fun with sleep n shit.
Have not missed a day yet.
Haha.
Can anyone recommend some music for me please?
ytcracker RowanBlanchard
Or eminem
Or stitches
Or Rick Astley
thanks :p
Hi!
Why is Vippy terminated?
hes sleeping
Hi RaeRae
Hey Aviv
What's up
Nothing except your face
That's actually true
And 15 y/o LOL
5.6 14
nope
Aviv: how tall are you
Depends
Either way I can't tell you
lolwut does that mean
And why not?
No personal information from me
at all
Uhm
whatsoever
xD
That game might already be over m8
km8
You see...back when we were bitter enemies
There was an easy dox
In which your name, ip, location, etc
became known to me
Oh that was him?
What?
^
Good bye

#When you watch porn and the you realize your window is open
Viper should be waking up soon.
I think so
Good morning
Morning.
Hello all
splitty_: Why is writing a GUI system so complicated?
TheBrokenKeeper writing a GUI system is not that complicated
Then I'm just lazy
^^
I want everything, some sort of a window like thing, and everything
But now, CS:GO time
I found out that it works on my laptop
And for the past 4 fucking months, I didn't play at all...
So fuck.
So splitty_, haxx0red TelBoard yet :P
Who hasn't? :l
Nah not yet ^^
Augment: have you?
I've lost interest in hacking TelBoard
Awww
I'm using prepared statements like you told me to splitty_
Not today- are you doing things that aren't retarded with it now
?
... I mean, seriously. Sticking everything in a text file and then outputting it without escaping
I got rid of that about 24 hours ago
Using MySQL with prepared statements
Better.
I already tested for JS injection and SQLi
Did you test for more advanced SQLi?
I ran stuff like:
'; DROP TABLE messages
And I believe that if it were vulnerable a ' should produce a PHP error
You should be more worried about XSS.
Even if you are using the functions, php developers aren't the best with xss protection :P use the library I sent you.
You sent me a library?
It must've been when I was pinging out
htmlpurifier.org
this
Reagan, I cannot login.
I am making some modifications to the system :P
Tell me when I can roam about.
Is there something weird with string comparisons in PHP?
show me what you're trying
It's storing the string (representing the current user) perfectly in $_SESSION
if($_SESSION['logged_in'] != true || $_SESSION[user] ==  || $_SESSION[user] ==  ) {
Now I know that the logged_in works fine
This only happened just now when I did the session comparison
Reagan, $_SESSION['logged_in'] !== true
You need double equals
Afaik
But...that worked before
I was going to suggest same thing, but even I don't know.
Dunno
Actually that's based on code that Viperidae wrote
I haven't coded in PHP for awhile.
Try strcmp?
I've only had a day's experience :P
sur
*Sure
Usually when I was doing PHP I was using === to compare by value or something like that
Now, I'll be playing games
Reagan, if all fails, try var_dump and send me the result in a PM.
var_dump($_SESSION['user']);
I better make food.
TheBrokenKeeper, Reagan: http://puu.sh/iju3e/b2f3dc2752.png
Can't view it
damn
PM me what it is?
I've modified the windows command-line to look more like a *nix one
Splitty@SPLITTYDEVPCNEW C:\Users\Splitty#
I didn't know Windows command-line had a prompt veriable.
varaible
*
sorry
typing quick
doskey bashmod=prompt %USERNAME%@%COMPUTERNAME% %CD%# :D
wow so ugly
Yeah. xD
My shock shell is sexy. prompt \u@\h \W\$
I really need to continue developing it.
splitty_: you need to change it up so it can use a normal /
Instead of bullshit windows \
Shock can also look like bash using prompt \u@\h:\w\$
lol
That's impossible
I mean, it's impossible to do that with the cmd
btw, Windows 8 supports both / and \
splitty_: somehow I broke Tel
xD
I have Auth.php here
<?php          session_start();         if($_SESSION['logged_in'] !== true) {                 die(
II must go brb
BTW that code is always returning true
I tried both a single and double equals
do-login.php?name=Splitty&password=Test AND 1=2 UNION SELECT column_name,2 FROM information_schema.columns LIMIT 1,1
oh
splitty_: Can you help me with GUI things?
How would one make a window-like thing?
Create a window manager, create a window class.
xD
I've done that
But related to rendering and such
Each Window and the Window Manager should be implemented as Game Components
Updating and Rendering the Window Manager should update and render all windows
But how to render the actual window? How to do things inside them, so on and so forth
Well, for now, I'll try to implement a button
But later
I want to watch some youtube or something
Just render close/minimize/maximize buttons and borders
Why do you want windows anyway?
A game engine doesn't need those
Then what should I implement?
And take a look at Unreal Engine. afaik, it comes with a full working UI system
Also, I won't implement windows. I don't know why I wanted to do that in the first place
TheBrokenKeeper
You should implement singleton renderers
Instantiating a Renderer doesn't make much sense to me
And it doesn't make much sense to instantiate the script manager
The user should just call an instance of the renderer/manager to do things
No one needs more than one instance of a renderer.
splitty_: You will be able to make multiple renderers
With different things, for example, you could get an object and make a renderer draw to a texture that you then draw on the object
Also, look at XNA's sprite batch, you instanteate that too
And you could also have multiple script managers, maybe you have a set of scripts that only deals with loading in resources. Maybe you have some scripts that deal with object interaction and such
Now, I'll be gaming
Well
You should make the script manager indexable anyway
scripts[player].Updater (); is way better than just iterating through all scripts.
Which would mean that you'd need to create a new script manager for every single script that has nothing to do with another script.
Update ();*
splitty_: What if you have 100 scripts that you want to update?
TheBrokenKeeper how about that? You can assign scripts to GameObjects
Every GameObject has its own Script Manager
Maybe
You could add Scripts for Health and stuff to the Player, scripts for the Weather to the World, etc
That works
You would update the game objects and the game updates would decide what scripts to execute
game objects*
Seems like a good idea
Also, hoe the heck does IronPython do so much magic with the dynamic keyword?
:D
Like... I can turn a ScriptScope into a dynamic thing and simply call functions and such from it
foreach (Script s in Scripts) {
((dynamic)s.ScriptScope).load();
}
splitty_: Like, that would call the load function from Python
Is there any tutorial on how that works?
splitty_: I found it. And it's fucking awesomr
Awesome*
Nice
ThePhoneKeeper / TheBrokenKeeper
You could also add Lua support
https://dynamiclua.codeplex.com/
I'll try
splitty_: What about http://www.moonsharp.org
Looks a little more up to date
Never used Moonsharp
For now, I'll stick with Python
As using IronPython I can actually write the whole game in it. No C# needed
I'll try that actually soon-ish
Okay
I don't know what to code
Hashlecter is in a usable state and there is not much to do currently
splitty_, take a break and admire https://github.com/JacobMisirian/TelBoard
xD
It's wonderful, isn't it
Just.. beautiful..
splitty_: I love how he uses PHP, JS and HTML in that post.php file
Yeah :D
I'll game some more
Hello, Aviv.
Hello, Aurora01.
Hi Aviv
Hi Viperidae
errr, have to fake a report card
bacon: You here?
Or splitty_?
I need to forge my districts watermark
Right
Aviv, I think it might be a good idea to include CSS-Framework in the Descant v0.1 release so that if it gets updated, it doesn't break v0.1 forums
Since it still uses rawgit currently, doesn't it?
I need a fucking vector image of their logo, everything I've found so far is too small :(
I need to think, but I can't
I want to program, but I'm stuck
The brokenness is getting worse...
I'm close to being very broken
yah Aurora01 I was going to do that
Good
Never watch 5 episodes of a TV series when you're sad, especially if the episodes you watched are fucking filled with sad shit...
I'm fucked
Viperidae did you infect Kaspersky with Vulcan? xD
Today is officially the shittiest day in the past two weeks
lolwut no
http://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article142297574/Virenjaeger-von-Kaspersky-finden-Virus-in-ihrem-Netz.html
Can't find an english version of this..
https://securelist.com/blog/research/70504/the-mystery-of-duqu-2-0-a-sophisticated-cyberespionage-actor-returns/
Here
A modular malware that uses manipulated images to store data xD
Hahahaha, the stenography used by Vulcan was very primitive. It basically uses a 1024x1024 image to hide shit in, using each RGB value to store a single byte by storing 3 bits in the R and G value, and 2 bits in the B value.
^^
:)
It's precisely 1 month since Descant's first commit, and we're just about ready for v0.1.0 release
How timely.
Nice
^^^^^^^^ <--- means fuck my life
STOP MESSING UP MY SMUXI LAYOUTT
*LAYOUT
Sorry...
Much better.
Sorry :(
I just do a /clear for that though
Right
Slackroad's the one to teach me... blame him
well bye slackroad
Aurora01, HexChat handles messages like that properly
It's a fork of XChat
Or, you could just not do it :P
How does Smuxi mess up the layout?
^^
Sorry Aurora... It's not my fault, I'm having a shit day...
Aurora01 did you see my WHIRLPOOL implementation?
splitty__: nope
Aviv, no idea.
https://github.com/SplittyDev/Hashlecter/blob/master/hashlecter/Implementations/WhirlpoolCryptoServiceProvider.cs
Aviv, remember to commit to the master branch now by the way
ok
I've implemented the Whirlpool hash because there was no good implementation in C# :D
Aviv: http://puu.sh/ijUfk/56bc0a6169.png
That's how it breaks it
are you just going to remove the front and back branches?
Probably.
Because merging them took me about 30 minutes xD
xD
lol
Cool, now I'll be away
Can't you just copy and paste the files? :P
lolno aviv
I mean, he could
If you don't copy the symlinks, git explodes
Aurora do you like my implementation? :D
Yeah
yay
It's witch-free code
:D
Personally I'd recommend using braces even for the one-line if/for blocks for consistency, but that's just my view
My slightly Python-inspired view of how things should be
I do that too, Aurora01
It just seems odd to me to have one rule for one-line blocks, and another for everything else
I only leave off the braces when I think that it doesn't make it less readable
My opinion is that you should establish one rule and always follow it, but it's not a major issue by any means
hmm okay
hmm listen to Aurora01 he's always right
If we'd have Python-like syntax in C#. I'd be the happiest person on this planet
make your own compiler then
As I find square brackets to be a waste of space
If there was Python-like syntax in C#, it would be Python :P
xDD
We need .Net staticly typed Python
And then we're set
or
NAH
As IronPython is just Python for the CLR
you could use VB!!!!!!
wtf
/kill Aviv First warning
Aviv keep your mouth clean
VB is a bad word
VBA is the best language
totes
Wouldn't you rather type End If instead of }?
I'd rather write 'Thanks VB, I'm done with the if now'
I'd rather type This filthy conditional block shall be closed
I am pretty sure that's possible in Shakespeare
It is
Afaik
I don't have much experience
Or what if you typed a bunch of exclamation marks!
If (TTK->isaway() == true)
!!!!!!
I think that is best
Yeah. the number of exclamation points is the amount of indentation
True
Or what if instead of that, you just wrote random letters!
AvivLang is the best
That would be hard to parse.
All hail TelBoard
http://misiriansoft.com/tel/
^
Is it vulnerable to XSRF, [Mobile]Reagan?
No
I have it sanitized for html/js and SQLi
Apparently it is
Wut?
Pm me
http://misiriansoft.com/tel/board.php
splitty__
I have something super cool to tell you!
Dreh den Swag auf!
Pm me how you did thay
*that
What did Aurora01 do?
Do you see the test alerts?
That appear
Anyway, I must go now.
Goodbye, poeple.
*people
Bye Aurora01
WHAT THE FUCK
My image editor STOPPED fucking working
How so?
Everything is frozen
Do you want to build a snowman?
No
Let it go! Let it go! Can't hold it back anymore.
I had to do it, I'
I'm truly sorru
sorry*
Now, I might be more away
Wtf Aviv :D
Money boy?
lol
you know it?
Sure lol
lol
so awesome ya?
Yeah
xD
Aviv, the on screen Win8.1 keyboard is sorta useful
I used it for accent marks lol
But now I have made my own special pr√≥gram for that
But it doesn't compare to a phone :P
lol
It should probably merge with WP's in windows 10
WP's is much better
HTC Sense 7's is much better
Have you used a WP keyboard?
One sec
That looks 100% broken, hard to use and useless
lol what?
Sense 7's: http://info-android.com/upload/posts/c7/5d/8048/4f121b07ce7e946a886f85220d8d01022ad85319.jpg
they look... almost exactly the same...
Except with less clutter lol
You sure?
Useful clutter
For symbols you use how often now?
All the time
For a ' I just long press 'c'
for ' I just long press period and drag
and for example
let's say you wanted to type
√°
How would you do that?
Hold on 'a' and drag
So... you have ! and √° on there?
I'm still not clear on how it is broken either
ÔøΩ?√¶√•√£ƒÖƒüÔøΩ?√´≈ô≈£≈Ñ
Are just some of them
Okay
√á√ü some more useful ones
Can you swipe on letters to make words?
Hi Emily!
Yup
Ah
Heya
Do you get word suggestions at the top of the keyboard?
Still can't believe my ISP blocked int0x10
pisses me off so much
:O why?!
What is your ISP?
This is all written through swipes and yes, I do get suggestions
BT
http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/qM7IdBWtQ6I/maxresdefault.jpg like that?
Although I find it slower than typing manually
http://www.productsandservices.bt.com/products/broadband-packages/?s_intcid=con_hpbop_bb
Do they present a reason as to why they blocked it?
Even better, Aviv
sure
I can also swipe to write your name. Aviv
Great
I don't think I can do ThePhoneKeeper, though lol
yeah it does Aviv for me too
Echos, does it do that too?
if you type Tel, it suggests Aviv
It might
it puts in Echoes
But I'll add Echos to the dictionary
Never fear
Mine is smarter then :D
RaeRae is here
yep it does now, ThePhoneKeeper
They provide no reason
lol
bantaful
lol why is it smarter to insert a fake word, ThePhoneKeeper?
Who knows if it's fake
I would not want it putting in fake words, that makes the whole thing useless lol
Aviv: https://m.facebook.com/echosofficial
There, not fake :D
it's still not a real word...
It works
look in an English dictionary and tell me if you find it...
in almost every case the person would've wanted echoes
Now I'll stop with the swiping, it's annoying
Echoes works too
Echoes, Echos, works
lol kk
But when you type JRM, does it suggest Keynes?
Because that sort of freaked me out because I had never typed JRM Keynes on my phone before....
hahahaha
I suppose it syncs from my PC
Maybe, I stopped auto predictions and swipe now. It was making me type slower
lol
Aft
It just depends on how good the predictions and swiping are ;)
Does a client exist that streams torrent as music like Popcorn Time streams movies? or just a client with pirated music
Or you could buy movies
no
Emily, use uTorrent. But you need the pro version for music streaming
Or just use YouTube?
This is CRAZY. Why is there no such client similar to Popcorn Time but towards Spotify/Tidal
Dunno
YouTube or uTorrent
http://atraci.github.io/Atraci-website/
Nice
HEY EMILY!
http://www.agardenersforum.com/ descant should look more like this
Hey splitty_ !
hi
How is Emily?
Emily is good
How is Aviv
Goodie!
Emily, are you still planning to visit me? :D
I'm sure he is
Depends on timing at the moment
My schedule got super busy
Emily: this is visiting splitty__ we're talking about!
This is a once in a life time sort of thing!
Right?
True but I don't have much of a say in regards to what I'm doing
http://9gag.com/gag/aXp81dP
Hmm k
Emily, just tell me in time
I hate how broken Smuxi for Winblows is...
splitty__: Can you draw?
splitty__ can do anything sillyh
Aviv: Can you draw?
no
Well fuck...
I can't draw ^^
Well fuck... x2
Aviv, Win8.1 blue screens look weird
Nullz, what OS do you use?
lol the blue screens are fine, ThePhoneKeeper
They are weird
Not really
win8.1
And contain a frown emote
How can a bluescreen possibly be Fine
^
Soo... I got my first BSOD...
It was fun
It even had a sad face on it...
I think it's trying to tell me that my CPU is frying and so is my RAM
yeah it had a sad face
That's good
How is that good?
Told you that you need thermal paste >>
http://www.iwillfolo.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Windows-BSOD.jpg
Nullz: What can't you understand? I cannot open this fucking laptop up, okay?
isn't it an adorable BSOD
It is impossible without the required tools
ik :p
I think it also changes color based on accent
so
ACOD
any color of death!
Great...
i've gotten 4 in 2 years(3 of them I forced to happen because I was testing out a pranking bluescreen thing) all of them were blue
Let's just say they broke what was best about Windows
The blue screens
SO I just came out to my best friend
She was like okay nice, which pronouns?? and i was like i use the binary pronouns and that's the end of that
xD
Emily, zer, zi.
Heya
he,she
Hello, Emily.
Woah.
but y'all be used to that anyway
Those are new.
wow
oh pronouns are kewl
2kewl4u
You are too kewl for me, Emily!
I always will be
So, Emily, what did you exactly come out as?
Genderfluid.
Homosexual Transsexual Dolphinkin.
I'm a bisexual genderfluid human.
Okay
That's tookewlforme btw
BACON HOW Did yoU KNoW
Emily, I read your emails to the dolphinkin foundation
You're also a helicopterkin.
It's not a matter of it being 'cool', it's being true to myself and expressing who I really am. Especially via the dolphinkin foundation
Hahaha.
bacon, you need to stop leaking my secrets or I'll leak your nudes
OH
Fine, I will leak them,
I think I found one

Heyo Nullz
How good does this look?
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/98653239/reportCardMarkII.png
Fantastic
Reagan, how does this look? https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/98653239/reportCardMarkII.png
I'm not sure what an actual report card looks like :P
(for your school)
Although I think that you should give yourself 1 or 2 absences
Reagan: Like this https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/98653239/SCAN0007.JPG
Also
My parents don't know I skipped any days
Still
Just to appear legit
Actually
They do
Don't they
Your dad knows
I CAN STILL DO SCHOOL?!?
Yeah, but he told me to cover it up
He doesn't want my mother to know
So your dad will know this is a fake?
Because then he'd be responsible for not doing anything about it
My best 2 grades were an A and a B my third is under an F
Or my dad will think I pulled some trick to not be absent
But your dad is still gonna know this is fake card
No he won't.
i will never understand the american education system
Viperidae: he knows you missed a day
I know he knows that
So when he sees no missed days
if we're not registered then the head of sixth form calls our parents straight away, emails are sent out
1 != 0
Reagan: That doesn't matter
I can easily pull of not getting marked absent, and he knows that
wtf is 'credit'
How much the class is worth
or 'per abs'
what why do your classes have worth
per abs means period absences.
oh okay
still don't understand why your classes have worth though
Emily: neither do I
but on a different level :P
Well, the classes most people take are only worth 1.0. That means, when your GPA is calculated it just goes in there once.
the fuck is a GPA
^
Grade point average?
Nullz: you don't know what GPA is
the fuck
?
Your final average score for High school?
Reagan: I'm going into 8th grade.
score? wtf
lelwut Nullz
Grade?
Like A, B, C?
I thought you were 14
We sit exams and get given grades for each of the subjects. I sat 28 exams in three weeks
Nullz?
I was held back in 1st grade because I didnt know how to read >> that was the summer I got into computers and played this wizard101 game which literally teached me how to read :/
I was 14 most of my 8 grade year
So i did 1st again for nothing
*8th
Sometimes I don't know how to read so
I'm 15 and in 10th grade
omg yeah you guys get held bak
back8
I'll be 15 in September though.
Emily: you know what's funny
That ain't a thing in England
Not anymore emily.
I was 16th the majority of my 10th grade year, I'll be 18 in October
You seem so professional and whatnot in your youtube videos
And then on IRC
^^^
XDDD
Youtube link?
It's so true
You're all like POOP ON MY DICK
????
since when did i want poop on my dick ew thats gross
OKAY I NEVER WANTED THAT TO HAPPEN AND I THREW UP SO
I don't express my sexuality or anything too personal on my YouTube as advised by my manager so
although i do hint at sexual abuse during one of those vids
ForsakenIdol?
Nullz: https://www.youtube.com/user/thejjaclub
I like your channel.
Lol, Nullz I'm forsaken idol
omg
+1
Oh thanks<3
Emily: I love your video on Feminism (sorta)
Where you give an example
(it had a very tumblr approach, sorry)
And you're like what if emily only makes this much
omg
Emily: that wage gap study you talk about has been debunked like 8 times
Those statistics are British ;)
Even still
and were sourced from last year
I'm gonna go to sleep
Goodnight
I'm not saying they aren't real
NIGHT
But their methods were bad
All they did was compare the average women salary to that of men
I thought you were gonna mention that i used my gender persona Emily
I did
Without taking into account women who choose not to work or work part time
Good :P That video is outdated so ;P
https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=1oqyrflOQFc
I ain't arguing against you, at the time it was accurate and now it ain't so :P
Errr
It wasn't really *ever* accurate
It might have been /considered/ accurate
u think i actually care rn
Nope
lel neither do I
I just wanted for you to know
Also I did share your video arounf
*around
Like I do care about equality and I realize that the gender pay gap is fictitious
I now read your messages with your voice xD
It was a lot better than the FUCK H8 VIDEO
OH great :P
And thanks aha!
Emily: you know what I'm talking about right
Potty Mouthed Princesses
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqHYzYn3WZw
But please don't forget that when I'm Emily, I use the she pronouns. If I'm Josh on here then it's he pronouns.
This video is almost laughable
You should upload more.
Emily: what do I identify as on your gender?
LOL: https://youtu.be/XqHYzYn3WZw?t=49
Nullz, the issue I have is that it's very seasonal and in accordance to my current mental state in regards to uploads
And what do you mean, Reagan?
What gender do you identify as
.
NickServ<	identify ****
Good morning
bacon: Do you have any idea on what I should make first with my very incomplete game engine?
Ichiru!!!
Hello!
hi
Have you seen my latest work?
no
https://github.com/chronium/ChronosEngine/wiki/Tutorial-1
you inherited ChronoGame from GameWindow didn't you?
Nope
oh
the FrameEventArgs made me think it was
Ichiru: https://github.com/chronium/ChronosEngine/blob/master/ChronosEngine/ChronoGame.cs
looked at it x)
Do you have any idea on what I should try and implement first?
make a game
and add to the engine as you go
That's the problem, I don't know what game to make
Ichiru: My game engine supports IronPython scripting
nice
But the current way I'm doing things is bad
I'm going to try and make it both 2D and 3D. Currently, it's 2D only
Ichiru: Do you have an idea on what type of game I should make?
go
platformer
idk how to make one but it sounds fun
NEVER!
Last time I tried, I quit in the first moment I tried
first moment I sarted*
As collisions suck
I couldn't get a basic collision system and such
Ichiru: Should I make the map renderer a Python script?
sure
super modular engine woo
I can also make it support C# scripts and Lua scripts too
I officially hate windows
I need to use the fucking command prompt to open a simple file...
PPTOScrub
Viperidae, are you here?
What is it with this idiot ^
He's not even pinging out
I could say the same about Reagan xD
[keyl0gged]Reagan?
Haha.
bacon: Why the fuck doesn't my Visual Studio build when I press F5?
not sure.
Fixed it
The build thing for it wasn't checked
bacon: Were window titles in the midle back in Windows 7?
Win7, the title was floated to the left
Amazing.
Being able to use Python scripts with C# is so fucking awesome!
I love that I implemented them
Now, I'll be gaming for a bit
I need to brainstorm a map renderer
hello!
Hi vegra
Viperidae: He wants to rule #OSN
15:57 <vegra> we re the new moderator üòä
wut
We have *nothing* to do with OSN
I know XD
But he self claimed himself as the ruler of that XD
#OSN is ... a thing?
wankers
^
Soo... I opened up mylaptop4
And then had a heart attack...
Because after I put it all back together, it wasn't starting
Sex-tape.mp4.exe?
Oh
It turned out that it just was that the RAM wasn't inserter properly
bacon, you here?
Also, this shitty dual core laptop has DDR3 RAM
I'm amazed
Yeah, TheBrokenKeeper.
bacon: Can you believe that it has freaking DDR3?
Actually PC3 which is the DDR3 for laptops
So bacon you been coding lately or chewing the fat *heavy sarcasm inbound*
[Mobile]Reagan: You need to implement Python scripting in all your future C# projectsw
It's a must
How does one do that?
IronPython
Look at my game engine for example
TheBrokenKeeper, I'm building libnotify.net
I need desktop notifications in windows xD
Nice

Hello, Cameron.
Hello, Aurora.
Nope, can't talk like that, feel like evil villain
Those days are over
sorry, died.
OVER I TELL YOU
Hey, Cameron. It was only official over on Tuesday.
BUT TUESDAY WAS A LONG TIME A GO

Anyone here know what Edmodo is?
lol
Viperidae, nope.
Now I do.
Well, it's basically an online educational rip off of Facebook
You join a group with a code
So, all students in my school taking Honors English 12 have to do a summer assignment
This summer assignment will be managed online through Edmodo
On an Edmodo page, any user can post shit to the page's wall (Think Facebook)
There is no captcha's or anything when creating a new Edmodo account
But it's educational, so it's OK
And to be fair, CAPTCHAs are useless now anyway
Anyways, I disagree with the notion of summer assignments
And think it's my job to liberate students from cruel tyrannical summer assignments
So, I'm going to write a bot that will create over a thousand new Edmodo accounts linked to this group
Then use them all to spam gay pr0nz, gore, ect
Forcing the teacher to change the code
Locking everyone out of the group
It will be a glorious cause!
It's weird, I asked the teacher for something to do on the 'summer' (not summer here) break.
Or, in the time you waste spamming it, you could just *do* the work
Aurora01, please don't be absurd. Spamming is the way.
Lol Aurora01 that's a horrible idea
/kill TheBrokenKeeper No spamming.
I'm a freedom fighter
Summer assignments are the worst things a teacher can give to the students
I should be constrained with stupid assignments to do when I'm on holiday
Unlike the cowards who are too lazy to do anything, I will fight back! And make a difference!
Viva la revolution!
But you won't make a difference
Yeah I will
Well, no positive difference
The thing is, the teacher will be forced to change the code
Locking all of the people from the group
Meaning that no one will be able to do the assignment
But surely they'd guess who used the code to spam it?
That's irrelevant, as they won't have any evidence linking it to me.
and if they try to take action against me for their mere suspicions, I will take them to court
Plus, since Edmodo is so big, I'm sure they already have spam prevention stuff
No they won't xD I've done raids like this before with people on 4chan
Why would anyone ever want to go to 4chan?
It's like the hell of the internet.
Viperidae: why is it than whenever you talk of glorious causes I read your text in my head with the accent of someone from ISIS
4chan is love. 4chan is life.
^
They don't talk like that, but lol
LOL
Some OP posted a pic of a phone in Imessages with the number at the top
Saying we should spam that number
I just got the OPs number by texting the target
https://www.dropbox.com/s/tis8ft7dzgpklkd/Screenshot_2015-06-11-14-06-17.png?dl=0

That's where that comes from
I'm about to prank call him
404 Not Found
Apparently the OP's name is Hussein
Goddamn it
Hello
Viperidae I feel like you're getting a little ambitious about avoiding homework
Oh no
LOL Viperidae
I just left a message for Mr. Hussein
About to send dropbo link

Viperidae: https://www.dropbox.com/s/o3zjjtwceoz3dtz/Kazam_screencast_00001.mp4?dl=0
Lol
That was a good 4chan visit
Hello Aviv.
Time to see if he has facebook
Viperidae: SHIT
SHIT SHIT SHIT
Guess who just tried to friend us?
Ross MacHattie
Aviv, will you be able to style the user control panel when you get time?
Viperidae
¬°Claro que s√≠, Aurora01!
lol
That's funny
J'appr√©cie, Aviv!
Viperidae: not really
Or perhaps, more accurately
What if he reports us
Je l'appr√©cie!
After all we are using his Son's picture and name
So fucking what, then the account gets deleted. No big deal
Meh
It's the only fake FB account we got though
If it wouldn't be too much trouble, would you mind moving your 4chan stuff to another channel?
Aurora01: This isn't 4chan stuff
lol
Well, whatever it is.
:\
Far weirder talks have happened in #int0x10
#int0x10 is all about peace and love man
And bacon
Indeed, there is insufficient bacon here.
And witch hunting
Your conversation is diluting the baconation of the channel.
Indeed, it's like cheap Tesco bacon with too much water, simply steaming away and shrinking into nothing
So, begone, bacon impostors.
Meanwhile, hooray for Docker and Vagrant
It makes the Django build process so much easier
Woo, got my C# code to going through tor
lol
Viperidae: I got a Python class going in C#! Woo!
How did you integrate tor into a C# app
yay
Can you just use torsocks
torsocks mono spam.exe
WebClient.Proxy, and privoxy
I wouldn't recommend doing that
I don't know how well torsocks would work with mono
Tor has socks?!
:|
Reagan, why does TelBoard use OOP-style prepared statements at the start, and imperative-style at the end?
Like in https://github.com/JacobMisirian/TelBoard/blob/master/TelBoard/do-signup.php
Viperidae: My fucking shitty laptop has DDR3/PC3 memory, I'm amazed
I think I started to switch stuff up Aurora01
Like as I learned more
.
Honestly, using a pre-built framework saves you a lot of effort and reduces the risks of XSS, XSRF, SQLi, etc, etc
I think I told him to use Laravel too
I said that as well :P
But, as I say, Django is the best way.
Or, melt your brain with Node.js
lol
Become a full-stack developer; master of JS, no other skills.
or make the entire software in jQuery
Aviv, tiny flaw in that plan
How is the server supposed to work?
It doesn't
you're talking to yourself
LoneForums
^
For those who just want to be alone
(and for those who can't afford a proper server)
lol'
I can't
What's Aviv's plan?
that's why I have my super awesome free shared hosting
Reagan: my plan is to take over the entire tri-state area
Oh?
You do not know what I speak of?
errr
I'm going to have to reinstall mono
Aviv: what is it
oh no
I can't tell you
Aurora01: io.js?
io.js is being merged with node
Slowly
But I have no intention of ever using either
lol
JavaScript's too evil for me
You get used to it eventually.
All the callback soup, random oddities, etc.
Aviv: https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript
YES!
My bot works
Viperidae: how many accounts?
So far
I haven't began mass generating them yet, I just was unit testing the EdmodoClient but I can register new accounts
Once I reinstall monodevelop I'll began mass creating drone accounts
Aviv: Today I almost broke my laptop
But now it's working
Oh no, what happened?
And working better, overheating less
I opened it up to clean it
Took out the RAM
Woo
brb
And when I put the RAM back, I didn't put them properly in
Aurora01: I just realized that C puts it's buffers in the stack...
Because that's why buffer overflow attacks work
Alright
We're generating accounts
One account every 20 seconds
Nice
Well, got to go now.
hi
Reagan: have you converted Tel to Node.js yet?
No
Is it server side?
Yes.
It runs on Google's V8 engine [citation needed]
And so the attack begins
Lol Reagan, members went from 18 to 54
It's goiNice!
Yay I broke TelBoard!
lol
It's doing that one thing
You know
Where it doesn't work
:P
I should rename TelBoard to Compton
OopsDidISayThatOutLoud
Viperidae: I may have a problem
?
I used to check error_log for php errors
But was getting filled with errors from our clients from that php code you wrote
So I rm'd error_log
And remade it
But it's not being populated anymore
Interesting
Ha
I figured it out
That was good
I guessed httpd uses like a streamreader or something where the file would still be open in a sense
So it was probably writing to /dev/null or something like that
So I restarted apache
I never thought I'd be so happy to see errors
:O
Or use Django
Reagan: Over 90 accounts so far
Or use ASP.NET ;)
Why does it take so long Viperidae
It's generating roughly 2.3 accounts per minute (I did this on purpose, so the server doesn't think its a DDos)
lol
108 accounts now
127 accounts and rising
woo
Viperidae: open source your edmodo bot
Become famous
Acquire bitches
(as Aurora would undoubtedly put it)
Ok
Reagan: It's really simple, and I don't want to put any evidence linking me to this on the internet like that
Err fine
Also, it really isn't production ready anyway. I just edited Main.cs for creating accounts on this one group
using (StreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter(new FileStream(creds.txt, FileMode.Append))) {
EdmodoClient client = new EdmodoClient();
for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
Well fuck you then
+!
Reagan: +! = 6.0415263e+52
+? TheBrokenKeeper
There's no mathematical operation for ?
...
^
+#
+*
+)
+fuckurbitch
Well, it's the ternary operator xD
++
++-+++-
But ! is factorial, and factorial(+) = fact(43) = 6.0415263e+52
But Reagan's usage would be incorrect
Indeed
+++
+1336
That would increment the current cell by 3, brainfuck rullz
+++--+ would make the current cell be 2
ok
Over 155 drone accounts :)
Viperidae: what are you calling them?
You want to see?
Yes
Are they trolly names?
\Or just pseudorandom strings
I love how 155/169 members of the group are drones
Viperidae: can you control the drones all at once?
Like have them *all* start posting gay pr0nz?
I'll add that feature, right now my program just generates accounts
kk
Once I have enough accounts (Friday probably) the attack will commence
So how many students IRL are supposed to join this edmodo?
I need to make sure I begin the attack early, because my goal is forcing the teacher to change the code, therefor making it impossible for new students to join.
Reagan: Best guess, 226
That's probably too high though
Maximize effect lel
If I ever am forced to join edmodo would you spam them for me? xD
My school's population is 1,809. I just divided that by 4 (Each grade) then divided that number by two (Advanced english, vs non advanced english)
There were like 16 accounts on here before I began creating drones
It will be funny will I have more drone accounts than students in my school
LOL what if the teacher got an email notification every time someone new joined
I was thinking that
In which case you should probably /write/ the gay pr0nz spamming
That way yyou can activate it at a moment's notice
In case she sees all the kids and gets alarmed
It'd be even better if there was a limit to how many accounts she can have
LOL
Is there
To my knowledge, no
https://support.edmodo.com/home#entries/21856320-create-a-group-teacher
Look at number 5 and 7
The Group code automatically lock after 14 days or if the teacher locks the Group before that time. If a locked code is used, a request to join will be sent to the teacher for their approval.
Yeah, I've already read that
And I know that
(That it locks after 14 days)
Ah
You can at the very least bombard the teacher with emails
That is some serious LOL
Indeed :)
I'll try to only use one account though for posting pr0nz at once
She will think its one account
Delete that
Then I just another
Her first course of action will probably to make it so people who join are read only.
I'll be able to counter that by registering a shit ton of accounts beforehand
https://support.edmodo.com/home#entries/21687959-manage-or-remove-members-in-your-group-teacher
Hahaha, they're no way in hell they'll be able to delete or make all my accounts read only with the tools Edmodo provides
FUCKING PHP
FUCK
I make like a minor change
Everything breaks
The 'error' is full of shit
And there's NOTHING wrong with my code
Fuck
And I have no way of reverting the file
$query = SELECT id, nickname, message, reply, replied FROM messages ORDER BY id DESC;
if ($stmt = mysqli_prepare($conn, $query)) {
mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);
mysqli_stmt_bind_result($stmt, $id, $nickname, $message, $reply, $replied);
Guessing there's something wrong with your code
mysqli_stmt_fetch(): Couldn't fetch mysqli_stmt
Line in question:  while (mysqli_stmt_fetch($stmt)) {
I haven't even made any changes to this area
Wow
It wasn't with that section
Somehow a sneaky close() line made it into the bottom of the loop
248 accounts
WooHoo: http://misiriansoft.com/tel/board.php

How did you reply that quickly
Hello, World! as MisirianSoft	This is my first post to TelBoard! I've put a lot of hard work into it!
Replier: r00t as r00t	Reply: Heyyyy
Nullz: replying is implemented in TelBoard
You should make a show replies button
Nullz, you know what Edmodo is?
No?
Its like a tutor?
Lolno
It's an educational rip off of Facebook
Basically, a teacher creates a group where students can post, and the teacher can post assignments, ect
In order to join a group, you need a unique 6 digit code
At my school, all rising honors english 12 students have been assigned a stupid summer assignment
The summer assignment will be done through Edmodo
Personally, I disagree with the notion of summer assignments, and I find this assignment an unfair waste of my time.
Then dont do it..?
Well...
I could not do it and get a 0
Or...
I could make it so no one has to do a summer assignment
haahalol
Dont get cought/in trouble though.
Night hoes
So, my idea is this. I will create a whole bunch of drone edmodo accounts that will join this group (I have over 300 drone accounts created so far by a bot). then I'll use all those drone accounts to spam gay pr0nz and gore on the page.
My bot right now is running creating approximately 2.3 accounts per minute
Oj ja good luck Viperidae
GUDNIGHT
Once I begin spamming her with shit, she'll try several things to stop it
One involves changing the group code
If I can get her to do that, so new accounts can't join; then she'll lock everyone else out of it. Meaning, a good portion of students will not be able to complete the assignment
Are you creating the accounts with a VPN?
or proxy
Tor
Tor FTW
I dont think youll get cought unless somebody else knows xD
Wait, isn't there alot of people at your school you knows your good /w this?
Nullz: they'll have no proof
Viperidae: if they ever bring you down to the office and say Sloan, do you know why we brought you here today?
No, I honestly don't sir
Respond in heavy 'ebonics' BECAUSE IM BLACK?!
xDDDD
So when will you be doing this? This weekend?
Yeah, right now I'm just creating drone accounts
I'll start the actual attack tomorrow
alright. Record her talking again xD
I'm not attacking that teacher, I'd never do anything to fuck with that teacher
This is some random english class
Well, some random english teacher
But tomorrow is my last day of school
So I won't hear anything about this until next school year
noooooo
oh lol
unless you get a letter ;)
Well...
They would never do that xD
Also, even if they got my IP (Which they won't, I'm doing this behind tor) there ain't jack shit they can do with it
This is perfectly legal.
Viperidae: not *really*
Yeah it is
One could construe it under the same sort of classification DDoS falls under
Nah
At the very least it violates Edmodo's terms of service
So Edmodo might actually have a legal case with you
Although I'm sure they wouldn't care
Which I don't care about, violating a TOS isn't illegal (In the sense of a criminal case). They could only file a civil lawsuit which I really don't give a shit about, and my IP is masked.
Yup
Now did you type any of this on IRC from a school computer?
Because the keyl0ggers are real
My school doesn't have keyloggers
(I've analyses their systems several times).
*analysed
Now I will go pick up dinner
You made me hungry.
TheBrokenKeeper you here?
splitty_: Yes, I am now
I was playing some CS:GO
Nullz: I'm planning on implementing a map renderer in Python for my engine
You play csgo? What rank/.
Rank 2...
I'm a noob
Just started playing again two days ago
nice
Last time I played, ranks didn't exist
TheBrokenKeeper, can you test the new Hashlecter with libnotify.net support in a few minutes?
I don't know how, but sure :D
:D
Thanks
Silver 2?
Private 2
Oh lol that rank does matter xD I mean competitive rank? http://gyazo.com/7565189c02f50e0fcb101fb8bd59a149
doesnt*
0
I'm shit at competitive
I don't recommend getting into it
It'll take all the fun out of the game
I quit playing it because of that. I was nova 3(not to high but not noob level), you literally have to practice and write notes on stuff about that game and at that point it wasn't fun for me.
Interesting
Woo! 500 accounts
Nice
I wonder if the teacher noticed
And if so, I wonder what the hell she's thinking
Nullz: Is it weird that I'm going to make most of my game in Python?
For some reason I love Python... And instead of making my game in C# like any sane person, I'm doing it in Python
game or game engine.
Game
The game engine is C# only
Oh, thats fine.
But it does support Python scripting
TheBrokenKeeper hashlecter works fine with libnotifynet :D
It's awesome
I don't even know what that library is, but cool!
:D
You'll see it soon
TheBrokenKeeper: http://www.xup.in/dl,39685461/hashlecter_libnotifynet.zip/
First run lecter -g -i Test >hash.txt
This will generate a file called hash.txt with the md5 hash of the word Test
Then bruteforce it using lecter -i hash.txt --incremental -a $u$l
Please tell me if the desktop notifications work :D
Unhandled Exception: System.DllNotFoundException: Unable to load DLL 'SQLite.Int
erop.dll': The specified module could not be found. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8

wtf
How did you call lecter?
./lecter.exe -i hash.txt --incremental -a $u$l
I'm using git bash
Oh
Aka Mingw32
Use the cmd
Why?
It worked to generate it
dafuq
There was a exception but it still worked?
No
...
This is cracking it, it doesn't work
But it worked to generate the hash
That's fucked up
It works
It just doesn't work with git bash
wtf
It works with the cmd
git bash seems to fuck up the arguments
splitty_: ./lecter.exe -i hash.txt --incremental -a abcTdefsuvt
This runs
But $u$l doesn't
OH I KNOW WHY..
git bash thinks $ is an variable identifier
\$u$\l works
\$u\$l *
So
This is so fucking slow to do with $u$l
./lecter -i hash.txt --incremental -a \$u\$l
Yeah it uses the full upper and lowercase alphabet
Speed  : 88870 hash/s
Max    : 282904 hash/s
Total  : 2579796 hashes
Is that fast or slow as balls?
dafuq
My bot is now creating accounts every 5 secomds
*seconds
TheBrokenKeeper that speed is okay. It does 103.000/s on my pc
lol Viperidae what are you doing
Interesting
Well..
TheBrokenKeeper, do you like the desktop notifications?
I'm not sure if I should keep them
Yup
They are nice
And look a lot like nVidia's
Okay thanks :D
lol
18:00 <Viperidae> Nullz, you know what Edmodo is?

You could bruteforce the codes and kick everyone else out
Oh my god
Reagan!
Are you there!
What?
We must begin the attack immediately
xDDD
What the hell happened?
Let me start tor
You are requesting to join: English 12 Honors Summer 2015
You have requested to join this group. The owner of this group must approve your request.
Lol continue to bombard the teaccher with emails
^
Let me start the pr0nz
I'll send you a list of accounts
Can you PM teachers or post publically
I'll be sleeping, brb, going onto Linux for logs
You can post publically
kk goodnight
Night
Viperidae: how to post publicly
Click on the group
k
Type your note here?
Then ah
&Yeah
*Yeah
I'll prank my sister. That prank will hurt like hell. xD
Viperidae: I am including a link to pornhub
With the message I found this website educational
Have you ever heard of a pepper called Carolina Reaper?
It has 2 million+ scoville

I'm back
But I'll be sleeping
kk
So good night or day or morning or afternoon or evening or whatever every body :D
Goodnight :D
night
Victory!
Me and Reagan got it shut down
This is a glorious day!

Good job.
Since tomorrow is the last day of school, there is NO way the teacher can communicate an alternative assignment to rising 12th graders
Reagan: She might try to bring it back online later, not sure
LOL
Wow, it's still possible to PM her actually
Aviv, the teacher deleted that group xD
Every single year in high school I always started off with a big 0 in english for not doing the summer assignment
Not this year!
I, GruntTheDivine! Have defeated the tyranny within the English Department!
I would argue 0 isn't a big number.
But okay :p
Good job! *everyone claps*
xD
I'm debating whether or not I should say anything to the teacher
Like, a warning that any attempt to reassign a summer assignment will result in another such attack
Don't
I wouldn't
Good Job, I guess
Not in person
Lol not in person
I mean via Edmodo
lol
Well, you are partially evil
so
WHY NOT?
Well, Aviv I don't think what I'm doing is evil
How so?
One day Aviv, you will be infected with this thing called Fucking shit m8 and it'll make you want to do things you were told not to do, and its really hard to not do them.
Don't think so
I don't see any reason why I should have to do jack shit during the time when I'm NOT in school
I'm fighting for my right to do nothing over the summer! Viva la revolution!

Good morning
Morning splitty_
I have replying implemented in TelBoard, which in my opinion makes it usable
kk
You should try it out
Let's see if having a conversation over TelBoard works
You start a Tel
Are you  Kostas as Kostas?
Goddamn it!
Somehow replying is broken
The replying does not work.
And no, I'm not Kostas.
Motherchode!
Hey TheBrokenKeeper, sorry I was busy.
Found vulnerability in Tel, [Mobile]Reagan.
It's luckily not a stored XSS.

Hi sexyjester Viperidae bacon napoleon sexyjester TheBrokenKeeper
Hello.

Hey Ichiru.
I'm going to try and get very simple vector drawing into my game
niche
it'd be nice to be able to have some dynamically scaled ui elements
once i bother adding in rotation
I should have (all flat shaded :( )
rectangles, lines and circles
#die
So Aurora01, did you here my mission was successful?
The group was closed
Well, to be fair, you'll probably just be given a good old paper copy of the work
Surely?
Today is the last day of school
There is no way they could communicate with everyone after today
Guess who's getting drunk tonight
Don't you have mailboxes and the postal service/
*?
Yeah, they wouldn't utilize that though.
In other news, someone has randomly forked Descant
We must be popular xD
Dayum, who
?
https://github.com/wnda/descant
That guy
Get forked m8
^
I need a nickname for Descant v0.1.0
Hymn \
How does Reagan's versioning system work for TelBoard by the way?
Aviv and I have spent a month making Descant v0.1, and he's already at TelBoard v1.2
xD
Aurora01: How did you say I would read a [[(0, 1), (1, 3), (0,0)],[(0, 1), (1, 3), (0,0)]] file in Python
?
f = open('file.json')
data = json.loads(f.read())
That's json?
Well, it'd be easier to format it as JSON
How would an array in JSON look like?
I'll pastebin it
http://pastebin.com/r0jDzVAH
I need a 2D array of tuples
Can those inner arrays become tuples?
tuple(inner_list)
Umn... that's not good
What's wrong with it?
I'm going to have hundreds of those
256*256 tuples
And?
Minimum
Is JSON the best format then?
And tuple(u, v) doesn't look great for however many of those is
Don't think so
I need a better format
Perhaps you should write your own compact format
I'm not the best :(
I mean, I have no idea how to parse it
Test it first though
Test if JSON works
Though honestly some sort of CSV file would be better
Aurora01: Seems like I forgot to add the search paths for default Python modules
Fuck..
I don't have json
I'm too lazy to add json
And what I need to do is store a map
Which will hold an array of arrays of tuples
And I need to do that without starting Visual Studio, I'm too lazy
I can only work in pure Python, no external modules
Descant v0.1.0 is out
https://github.com/Aurora0000/descant/releases/tag/v0.1.0
Download it, get vagrant and docker, and install simply by typing:
vagrant up
Aurora01: What about making a PyTileMap serializer?
That could work
You do that
And I'll take all the credits
Deal?
Sounds perfect :P
Well, anyway, I'll have a job for you soon
I'm on Winblows
Start translating Descant to Romanian/any other languages you know.
I only know English, Romanian, C#, Java, C/C++, Python, so on and so forth
But I also have a job for you, start making that serialzer
Well, you know English virtually perfectly, and I hope you know Romanian just as well.
I don't know how to translate
Now, give me the json file with all the things
Step 1: Look at English word
All the localization things
Aurora01: Was I disconnected?
TheBrokenKeeper, how would you translate 'Tags' to Romanian?
splitty_, you here?
yeah
Just came home
How would you translate 'Tags' to German?
Aurora01:
'Tags' = 'Etichete'
Excellent, thanks a lot.
Aurora01, Etikette would be the translation but Tags seems more appropriate.
All germans will understand it.
So using 'Etikette' would be less well-understood?
Oh, and could you both provide translations for this table?
https://github.com/wildlyinaccurate/angular-relative-date#translation-keys
Aurora01: I guess you can't provide a table like thing for me? I have some work to do but I can find space for translating
Well, I'll create a JSON-formatted file, so you just fill in the blanks
Yay :D
And I really appreciate the help
Then you can use Descant in Romanian, if you so desire :D
NEVER!
I've never used any software in Romanian
Even when I was two and a half years old I still used them in English
Aurora01: {{time}} from now would mean how much time in the future, right?
Yeah
It'll be a number
Like 3 days ago
Etc
Yup
I'll push the JSON files in a second
https://github.com/Aurora0000/descant/blob/v0.2-devel/static/descant/translations/lang-en.json there you go
Copy the time ones into lang-ro.json and translate when you have time
Okay
How would I go about doing things?
I forgot how to do pull requests and such
If you like, just pastebin your changes
How to do the pull requests?
Is it just a fork?
Just fork it and then click pull request
Okay
.
Aurora01: How to clone a branch?
Or how to switch to that v0.2-devel branch?
git clone -b v0.2-devel <url>
Or if you already have the code
git checkout v0.2-devel
That was easy :D
Git is easy :P
Aurora01: Umn... something like {{seconds}} ago, would something like with x seconds ago work as a thing?
As Romanian kinda requires the first part
Wait, no
Scratch that
I was just an idiot
Well, it will probably be written as posted {whatever}
If that helps
Or edited {whatever}
Yup, the with part is required for that
Aurora01: Romanian localization is quirky
That's weird
We have an extra word between the number and seconds(example), if the number is bigger than 10
So, I'll use the one that sounds better
Wow, that's irritating.
Aurora01: If I commit, will it do the current branch?
Aurora01, Etikette is used for multiple things. Tags is better.
splitty_: Okay
TheBrokenKeeper: it doesn't really matter, it matters where you push to
git push origin v0.2-devel
Aurora01: Pull request made
Yay :D
How to see how bad it looks?
I'll update the server in a minute
Okay
http://django-descant.rhcloud.com/static/descant/#/topics
It should auto-detect Romanian as your language if your browser has the setting
It doesn't :D
Well, I don't have a manual language choice yet
splitty_: Take a look at the beginning of this, you'll die from how tangled it is: https://github.com/chronium/ChronoScript/network
That code is just an explosion, TheBrokenKeeper.
Yup
TheBrokenKeeper: if you want to test it, go to chrome://settings/languages
Assuming you're using chrome
Then add Romanian, drag it to the top
Then refresh descant
Aurora01: Where's the locale for posted and such?
Not implemented yet.
Will do it soon
Lazy...
But it works
I'M NOT
I WAS WRITING THE FRENCH TRANSLATIONS
IT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE I BARELY KNOW FRENCH
You know more than me
I did over 4 years of french
I have no idea how to say my own name
I'll be doing the gaming now
Don't mind my chinese-like grammar
TheBrokenKeeper, POSTED and REPLIES locales are available
To translate whenever you have time
Night
bacon, wait
We need Australian translations
:P
Aurora01
Yes?
What are the seconds/minutes/... from now translations for? o_0
http://django-descant.rhcloud.com/static/descant/#/
Take a look at the times
Oh
Sorry
I misunderstood
They're just part of the library I use
Oh okay
Leave them blank if you can't be bothered
Or just delete the entry
Then it'll default to English for those values
I translated them
Just seemed weird to me
I've added some more keys now, if you'd be able to help
You will all get prominent crediting for this, obviously, because it's not an easy job and it's very helpful to me.
Aurora01 https://github.com/Aurora0000/descant/pull/16
Thanks, splitty__
Uhm Aurora01
I have a weird problem xD
Yeah?
I just saw that you added some new keys to the translations
So I edited the german translation
But the pull request looks weird. (didn't send it yet)
It changed files like topic-firstpost.html and stuff
Send it anyway, see what happens
I can always reject it if it goes wrong
Wait I'll see if I can sync with you
You may as well do your translations in batches because I've still got a reasonable amount that needs localising.
Perfect
Fixed it
https://github.com/Aurora0000/descant/pull/17
yay
Hello Cameron!
Welcome to #int0x10, aka translatedescant.com
Hey Cameron
Wat r beans
Hallo people
Hallo Aurora
Hallo Splitty
:D
translatedescant.com not actual website 0/10
Donate, and it could be real
Where r money hole
donatedescant.com
Aurora01: Can you remind me tomorrow to translate the rest?
Sure
Not real website 0/10 cannae have my moolah
Hi!
Hey
Hello, Aviv.
splitty__, more translation keys if you want
Hi!
nice
Aurora01: https://github.com/Aurora0000/descant/pull/18
Merged
Awesome
I'll translate some more tomorrow, currently. I can't be bothered, I'm too tired
Alright, this commit that I've done now should be the last of it
:P
Oh, hold on
1 more thing
Then it'll be done
Will you guys be here for me on my b-day? In 12 days?
If you want I will give everyone a photo of a cake slice :D
You can give me money as presents, I take everything you give :D
Isn't it a bit early?
Well, a fortnight is two weeks.
So no, it's fine
Okay...
Assuming your birthday is at the end of your birth-fortnight.
Maybe
It will be in a Wednesday
Aurora01: https://github.com/Aurora0000/descant/pull/19
Merged
Translating is fun :)
Well, when we add more features, you'll be needed again
splitty__: Too many Rammstein references. Du hast is copyrighted...
xDDDD
Du hast means you have
Nice
Now... why is German so fucking hard?
There's no such thing as too many Rammstein references
+1
http://9gag.com/gag/avZnw5E
Aurora01, Brackets makes stuff easier
http://puu.sh/impPC/3e8eea64ff.png
Brackets <3
Haha
Brackets just explodes when I try it
lel
I dislike Brackets. I either use Sublime Text or a special tool from JetBrains
It didn't let me open the german version because it was ANSI encoded
I converted it to UTF-8 and now it works fine
TheBrokenKeeper why do you dislike Brackets? It's awesoe
I don't know
I don't have any reason
Descant now fully supports French and German
Partially supports Romanian
Give me 10 minutes
splitty__, is your browser set to use German?
If so, look at http://django-descant.rhcloud.com/static/descant/#/
Aurora01: How can I pull the changes from the branch
?
From your fork?
Yes
Aurora01 you're trying to access lang-de_DE.json
But the file name is lang_de.json
Give me a minute
Also, I think lang_de-DE.json is better than lang-de_DE.json
Well, I don't really get a choice in the matter, the browser sends it the other way
(de_DE)
oh okay
I thought it was de-DE
Aurora01: Help, please?
Depends on which standard you follow
TheBrokenKeeper: oh, sorry
https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/
Doesn't help :(
TheBrokenKeeper did you add the upstream remote?
Nope
wow.
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin <url_of_your_fork>
git remote add upstream <url_of_auroras_descant>
http://django-descant.rhcloud.com/static/descant/#/topics splitty__
Check if everything is right using git branch
git remote*
You can sync the changes using
git checkout v0.2-devel
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/v0.2-devel
Do a simple git push after that to push the changes to your origin
splitty__, the German translation looks awesom
Aurora01: Nice. The New Topic button doesn't seem to work tho
*awesome
Wait
Really?
Thank you, and yeah :D
It still says New Topic
And I did a cache reload
Oh Aurora01 I think you misunderstood me
Sorry I should have been more clear
Ah, I see what you mean now
Aurora01: That POSTED key, what does it exactly mean?
Is it like the reply when you post something?
Or the posted things?
It's used in posted <whenever>
splitty__, I'm not sure why it isn't working.
I can reproduce the issue though, which is good.
Found the issue
The text that wasn't translated was on a really long line
Which was overflowing so I couldn't see it
Ah okay
Fixed it now splitty__
http://django-descant.rhcloud.com/static/descant/#/topics
Nice!
Hi
Aurora01
Aurora01: https://github.com/Aurora0000/descant/pull/20
Hello NikxDa
Can you please set up something where I can test my CSS changes to Descant immediately?
I want to design a whole new theme and I'm not willing to make a pull request for every single px change so I can see the changes
Hmm, I'm not sure what the best way to do that is
Here are the choices:
Me neither, ask splitty__ he says he knows
a) Fork it, and when that's done, pull request it
b) I give you write access
a) No method to see changes immediately
b) Okay
With either method, you'd need to have a local web server or something
The server that we use is just periodically updated manually.
I'm on OSX right now, I have a server on nikx.io tho
Aurora01: When you have time, will you write for me a map serializer? Which uses no external moduleS? I'm too lazy to link them?
I could theoretically just upload descant to my server
And change stuff there
But I have know idea how your system works
Databases?
You can just upload the frontend code
fron static/descant
And the REST API will still contact the main server
How can I see it then?
Just copy all code from static/descant on to your server
You'd need to implement a method to change the CSS origin then
Why?
If I upload just the CSS
How will your server use it then
Well, it wouldn't work if you just did that.
Or do I understand somethign wrong
NikxDa you upload the CSS and HTML code.
The HTML and the API are totally separate
https://github.com/Aurora0000/descant/tree/v0.2-devel/static
You don't have to have them on the same server or anything
git clone v0.2-devel https://github.com/Aurora0000/descant.git
cd descant
oooooh
I get it now
So your local HTML copy will still connect to my server
mv descant/static /path/to/your/webserver/descant
So I can just run Descant on my server and it will still fetch the data from Auroras server
And do all the python-y stuff
Correct?
Yes.
Exactly.
Just tell me that in the beginning :D
Thanks
Sorry, I should explain better
He did...
:P
I wasn't particularly clear, to be fair
I may have gotten him wrong there
Well, true
Still thanks
Anyway, I've got to go now.
Will work on that tonight 4 sure
Have a nice evening
Or whatever time it is at yours
Good night, NikxDa.
Good night Aurora01
Night splitty__
Night!
Night everyone else who hasn't received a special 'night'
:P
So everyone whose username starts with A just happened to bugger off at the same time
Except good old AndroUser2
lel
Hey iNTERNAL
hey @all
Who is _InTERNAL?
I know like nobody anymore except bacon
Everyone from the old GeckoFX/Devatan days have vanished from the lands of IRC
Cameron,  well,  I was on tdf
So was I
So there's that
So was I
I suppose that's far back enough
But still fairly recent
I first joined TDF in 2012 but...
I guess that's recent xD
Aye but GeckoFX/Devatan you're talking like 2010/11 :D
Surprisingly, I knew IntelloTech before I knew any of you.
Ah now that's a blast from the past
How's he doing these days?
Still playing supervillain?
No clue xDDD
But not quite as supervillain as Softwerx
I came across him on Youtube a very long time ago and talked to him briefly via PM on Youtube I think
Then years later bacon told me about how he haxoredeszed Devatan
I hacked a local wifi hotspot tday
Yeah there was a lot of drama about that
This is history!
Idk if you heard about Softwerx though?
People, you need to write about the old history
Me? I only heard of him, don't know any details
Nah, but how are they playing 'Supervillian'?
But still
He was some proper massive troll on the GeckoFX forums
Always trying to sell his own fork of the software, MozNet, which seems to still be around http://se7en-soft.com/software/moznet/modern.aspx
I play supervillian with the communities that Aviv has descended from
Get together on a document and write the freaking history. NOW!
I just remember the days where Devatan would disappear and get replaced by some evil message from IntelloTech and we'd all go on the IRC and panic
http://osnetwork.ga/
MUHAHAHA! I HAVE YOUR PASSWORDS!
(I swear I had *nothing* to do with that xD)
But they were all just MD5 hashes
Well Cameron
Experiments conducted by Splitty_ and Reagan confirm that with every database there ought to be hashes vulnerable to a dictionary attack.
Liking the h4x page there
For a while I couldn't be bothered to join int0x10 because I was sick to death of switching forums
There had been something like the GeckoFX forums, about 3 incarnations of DevAtan, TDF and the devvers subreddit and by the time int0x10 surfaced I was just like for GOD'S SAKE
Then Rob (Proto) tweeted me and told me to join so I had to because Rob gives me bumsex
TIL
Hahahaha, I was never in DevAtan sadlt, just TDF but I kind of wanted to create a TDF-esque community,
#TIL indeed
I miss the old days, I wasn't active on the frums but I was sorta active on the IRC
Same ^
I can give a lot of TIL if I wrote that document I'm being told to write
Unfortunately I have useful things to do
This man is a legend http://consequenceofsound.net/2015/06/dave-grohl-breaks-leg-after-falling-off-stage-in-sweden-finishes-concert-anyway/
TheBrokenKeeper: Did Reagan leave yet?
Don't think so
Ok, he said he will be going to Jesus camp soon for like 3 weeks
LOL so I just sent that teacher an email
Hello, Edmodo is giving me an error message that says Invalid code when adding the code ww9p4f for the 12 Honors summer assignment. The paper my english teacher handed me says that it will expire in two weeks, but the letter was only printed on June 5th. Can you reset the code?
Thanks,
Thomas.
Awesome!
wtf Viperidae
Jesus camp?
Sounds bad.
Yeah
What the hell is a jesus camp
His church is going on a 3 week camping trip
oh wow
If only the church of satan offered something like that..
Jesus camp?
Sounds like somewhere you'd get touched up if you're under 16
xd
If only aliens would come to evolve us...
^
No one say anything, but I think Reagan is starting to have trouble with his faith.
Viperidae the descant network graph looks really weird :D
http://puu.sh/imv1w/862dcb65a9.png
Stick the Underground logo on that and you've got yourselves a map
splitty__: Mine is even worse...

Well not really
It's just more tangles

Wow it indeed works

I'm impressed with how he managed to make css THIS messy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQK00RM3JsI
I laughed so hard

Some premature ejaculation right there
I'm so sorry
I still had to laugh
We might still be able to meet someday to sexually stimulate our genitals for sexual arousal until orgasm together.

;);)
Why the LISP notation tho
xD
Because he's cool
(I am too)
:)
I think I'm not making friends here right now. Gotta go work on Descant before more people come and see me like that
I behave like that and don't work on Descant at all and I have plenty of friends :D
But then... I have HISTORY
xD
xD
Hey Aviv
Hey splittywitty
There is someone who wants to talk to you ;)
ooh
Who who who?
Is it
NikxDa?
WHO IS IT splitty__????
Is it Money Boy?
NikxDa. xD
AVIV
You fucked Descant up
HOW!?
You're still asking lol?
class=box list-list
Uhm
Okay?
<post-list>
http://cssguidelin.es
Read
Learn
I didn't do the <post-list> things
Repeat
lol I don't care about someone's guidelines as long as I'm following the real standard
You're not
The site above combines all relevant Guidelines
e.g. BEM naming convention
Most important I'd say
‚Ä¢four (4) space indents, no tabs; already left
Then how to properly use classes
tabs are better
No
No they are not
They are.
not
Tabs are interpreted differently by every ide / editor
The standard notepad for example uses 8 spaces per tab
This makes HTML which uses tabs unreadable
lol
So if you use 4 spaces, you get the most same experience overall
NikxDa: that site is ridiculous
That site is awesome
At least I'd say so
Just read and decide for yourself
Ok
My projects mostly have followed those rules and they work nicely
Sure
Reagan wtf
lel
Aviv, I'll do a redesign and I'll rework the css
Keep track: http://exp.nikx.io/Descant/descant
lol k
I have been meaning to redesign it a bit
Your use of classes is awful :I
Thanks.
More examples?
I'll be gaming now :D
I didn't do all the fake elements, that was Aurora, btw
Sorry? Not meant bad, just saying. The examples are basically everywhere. You just name them how it comes to your mind it seems
e.g.
If you have list-item
you should first have a list
<ul class=list>
<li class=list__item>
/BEM naming
Block__Element--modifier
no.
So you can easily do the following then
There's a reason I've never seen that naming convention anywhere before...
class=list__item list__item--error
It's awesome
Not.
Why not
Explain
It's just not needed
The only thing that matters about a CSS class is if it gets the idea of what it is for across
and that's going overboard
Well if you do it like you are currently, you will end up like MS in their sources and use shitty classes because the normal classes with the proper name are already used and not written reusable
k
I've worked with guidelines and without, you should try too
Anyway, time to restart for trackpad drivers, woo!
Ask splitty__, he can prove me right
No thanks
Well
D
That escalated quickly
dafuq
hi splitty__
What's wrong?
hehehe beans
Reagan: have you asked NikxDa for help with Tel since NikxDa is just oh so good with CSS?

That's Islamic law :P
She's with her son..
The apple scene?
Also: TelBoard github is updated
Viperidae: check this out: http://misiriansoft.com/tel/users.php
I do hope you understand that not all muslims oppress women like not all christians oppress women, despite the fact that both holybooks are sexist as hell
Dammit I had a list of bible verses ready for his response to that
Someone remember this if this comes up again
Corinthians 11:7
Corinthians 14:34
Ephesians 5:22
Timothy 2:9
Colossians 3:18
Aviv
I never said I was good, I just said you should use those Guidelines because I do think your CSS sucks
Hurtful ;'(
It works.
I might still be wrong but it's my personal opinion
Ye mine doesnt
Can you help me rly quick?
Viperidae: back
Also I think my DE broke
I'm trying to replace those <nav-btn> Elements but I honestly have no idea of Angular and I can't find where they are used
Aviv
Anyways, that Islam video is legit
wooo <3 Islam
I can click on anything except for the applications thing at the top
lol yeah I've tried too, NikxDa
I asked Aurora to remove them but he refused xD
I found the directive but I do not understand why it refuses to load the content into <li> Elements as soon as I change it
Weird stuff going on there
lol
yeah
Viperidae: you see the users.php
gotta hate JS
Yes
Yes
And the user profile like thing
You can click on users in that list
Messages this user has posted:
Nothing
Or click on their posts
xD
Viperidae: which user
Jacob
lol Viperidae
lelwut
I honestly want to rework the thing but I cannot do it with those elements being there
Infact
sad isn't it, NikxDa
I clicked on the link
My brain refuses to work on something this wrong
And it redirected to http://misiriansoft.com/tel/do-user.php?user=
;P
With ho user specified
lol
Viperidae: http://misiriansoft.com/tel/do-user.php?user=Jacob
ho user?
Aviv, please help
:D
Search w/ me
I can't, I don't know how either lol
Reagan: I am capable of figuring that out, but you should use user IDs instead of usernames
Viperidae: click this link: http://misiriansoft.com/tel/users.php
It is apparently because of the templates
Any Angular-Wizards here?
Viperidae: so right
Nope
Oh shit
The thing is broken in the users list
And nothing on users.php links to any valid profiles xD
Well click on usernames in board.php
Aviv btw
It'd be nice if you at least took a look at class grouping
I admit BEM is a thing of preferrence
But class grouping is actually useful
Viperidae: fixed it: http://misiriansoft.com/tel/users.php
btw those tables look really ugly
You can see my tables?
Oh
Tengo que ir
Although I do like how they worked out with replying and such
How they group together for a conversation
Just write some CSS to make them look good
me
whoops
I am terrible at CSS
Everything I try and do ends up looking like the 80s
lel
Well
90s - 2000s
Are you happy w/ http://nupdate.net

I made it a few years ago, the code sucks, but I like the design. If you enjoy it, I might help you when you need

Last day of school Viperidae, howd it go? Teacher say anything?
Hi Nullz
I sent an email to the teacher
Any reply?
I said
17:03 <Viperidae> Ok, he said he will be going to Jesus camp soon for like 3 weeks
17:04 <Viperidae> LOL so I just sent that teacher an email
17:04 <Viperidae>
17:04 <Viperidae> Hello, Edmodo is giving me an error message that says Invalid code when adding the code ww9p4f for the 12 Honors summer assignment. The paper my english teacher handed me says that it will expire in two weeks, but the letter was only printed on June 5th. Can you reset the code?

hmmm
Gonna attack again on july 1?
Yeah, I already won though xD I don't think the word will get out, so no one will do it (And if barely anyone does it, then they won't grade it)
Good job! :D
That weird moment when you make a shit ton of changes to your code, and except the compilation to fail when yous see Project Built 100%, Build Successful
LOL
I never trust that
Like I am always worried about a logical error then
The happened to me before. Wish I recorded what happened.
Oh?
The thing is, the IDE I'm using isn't as helpful as VS in pointing out errors on the fly, so it's possible to make a simple mistake and not notice until you actually hit compile (VS would underline an error in red)
Yeah monodevelop is that way as well
Also
Back when I used to use mono
*nano
Well..
I would say Monodevelop is friendlier
Also Jacob
I would compile and gmcs would give me more errors than could fit on the terminal screen
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; must be annoying as shit
What version of mono are you using?
IDK
Why?
because I realized the other day I've been using a REALLY old version of Mono, and the fedora repos didn't have the latest version.
I upgraded my Mono, and reinstalled the latest version of MonoDevelop and I'm amazed with how nice it is
Oh
Compared to the older version
How is the new mono any better :P
The older mono had some bugs with SSL certificates with System.Net. It was preventing my SpamBot from working
Oh lel
Is this what your Monodevelop looks like https://youtu.be/VrWlq8L5jiE?t=138 (Ignore the editor colors, I did that on purpose)
This is what the latest version looks like http://www.monodevelop.com/images/390-ss-debugger-5-4.png btw
LOL
Vash Amation 8 months ago (edited)
AWESOME!!!! i don't even understand........there are a lot of words though..... o.o
What does this do.....XD
:|
xDDD
lel
Just Pmd it to you
Anyways
Do you have that version of mono?
(The old one)
Jacob, did you have that version of MonoDevelop?
WEll
On this shittop I do
Ah, but the dongtop?
But on the dongtop I have the new good
version
Noice
I think anyways
I'm not sure
I wish there was some easy way to do file associates in Linux so I don't have to do iodine myFile.irx
For irx files (I could just use shebang for plain Iodine source files, but I can't for irx)
Should Iodine drop an IRX file when ever I run a program?
Whst is IRX?
It's a compiled Iodine program
^ +1
Oh
If I ran a plain Iodine file, I could make it drop an irx then next time if the irx is newer than the original program, it will not compile the original source code (As it already has done this) and just run the irx
I'd be good because if I run the same script more than once, it doesn't have to be compiled each time
But the bad thing would be Iodine would be dropping IRX files every time a program gets ran
aw why?
?
Nullz: Why what?
Why'd he leave
Well
He could have heard his parents coming
Or had to restart
Or he just went, but it would out of character for him not to say bye
oh yeah I forgot about his parents.
lol
I didn't even notice smuxi quit
I think it was because smuxi runs with mono
And I had to run a killall mono
Yeah, Smuxi was written in C#
Noice!
#C#Power
I haven't been using C# for big projects xD
shh
C# for life..
I...agree-ish
Lol I was just joking
Well it's not a bad language
C# is great but it can't do everything
Well
C# isn't good for writing critical code, and the other problem with C# is it being dependent on an implementation of the CLR. That isn't too much of a problem on Windows, as .NET is installed on most Windows machines; but it is with Linux which requires Mono (And C# programs have to be invoked with the mono command as well).
Viperidae: linux associates exe files with mono
If they are chmoded
You can just do ./myprogram.exe
It will requires mono to be installed though
*Still
That's the problem, it has dependencies. And big ones too.
Meh
It's an extra 128mb on my system
I don't mind it
I don't either, but it's stupid to release programs that require it. C# would be a horrible language to write Iodine in
I won't be using only C# forever, I'm gonna expand to C# and C soon.
^
+!
shit
The thing is, to choose a language that's appropriate for what ever project you are working on. C# isn't suitable for writing an efficient cross platform programming language interpreter, which is why Iodine is being written in C++
How hard is it to do GUI things in C or C++?
Honestly
I've never done any GUI stuff in C or C++ xD
Doing a GUI with the Win32 API is a bitch
It's terrible napoleon
*Nullz
hmm. What about libraries?
If you use a wrapper though, like GTK then it isn't that bad
Errr Viperidae I disagree
Oh cool :D
Even GTK with monodevelop is overly shitty
You can't just drag and drop a button
Jacob, first off that's a problem with an IDE
You have to make these weird ass wrappers
Have you ever done any GUI code with GTK WITHOUT an IDE?
and I mean pure GTK code, not a C# mono wrapper for GTK
Hell no
Never!
Then you can't speak on this xD
I'm sorry, but the GUI designer is bad feature for VS for new programmers
I dont care about drag and drop. If I can just do GUI.AddControl(new Button(75,25,Click Me, void ClickEvent)); with a library, that'd be cool.
If you throw a basic text editor at some novice C#/VB developers and ask them to create a GUI program, they would be clueless on what to do XD
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwST7leB0Sc
Wow look at this guy's setup ^
Already seen it
Viperidae: check it out
Hello, World in C for GTK http://pastebin.com/T8Sz8fys
>>Creates Wrapper around GTK
GTK isn't that bad, you just have to learn how to use it. It's really just as simple as C#; it's just the C language doesn't have stuff like objects, static classes, ect so you have to do things a bit differently than in C#
Yeah and, I have more than enough resources to learn both C and C++ now :D
The best way to learn any language imo is just by trying some projects in it
(Of course, you should read about the language first)
And now that I know about its as easy to just do remove or whatever it was for memory management and that the weird *'s or whatever do(pointer/reference in that area) it doesnt look as scary
Hi!
Hello.
Pointers are really essential, I happened to know alot about them ever since before I started working with C. The reason being because I wrote VMs, and knew alot about assembly
and hi Aviv
Hi
I love pointers
I always use them
The only reasons I was scared of learning C++/C was literally that *, memory management and GUI.
.css {
cursor: pointer;
}
:|
I made a pointer!
+1
That a CSS pointer, everyone!
Yeah, alot of the stuff I write doesn't require a GUI, so that part doesn't bother me
CSS is like C, but more advanced
Definately
A pointer is like a address to the same object in the stack(I believe stack) so I can have multiple ways of accessing the same thing without creating a copy of the object.
Thanks for agreeing
Aviv, sometimes its easy to mistake your intentional sarcastic with unintentional stupidity.
Exactly the plan
*sarcasm
oh
Yeah Nullz, except having pointers to things on the stack and passing them outside the current function is very dangerous. Objects (When using the 'new' keyword) are not allocated on the stack, they are allocated on the heap.
ps: css is so advanced that it doesn't even need functions
Python too aviv.
Really now?
yep... didnt even learn functions were a thing in my computer science class that did python.
def function_name():
^
lol it showed up as a frown face for me
Yay Iodine is object oriented and it doesn't even have classes!
*claps*
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
How does that even work?
http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18e9zns7m6pdngif/original.gif
Prototyping
I can just do
myObject = Object();
myObject.someValue = something;
That's...
awesome
myObject.someFunction = someFunction;
Oh shit awesome
now I just need to get my garbage collector working and refactor some more things
Your almost done?!?!!
No, I'm going to add classes and a standard libary
Right now I have the following
Objects (Function, Integer, Boolean, Tuple (Array), String)
Functions
If statement, while statement, return statement
Dynamic typing (Duck Typing)
Viperidae Aviv Nullz
?
I will be off to bed now
jacob: bye
Night
And I won't see you for three weeks
Goodnight Jacob! Have fun! Make the best out of it. (Get yourself laid?)
Yeah boi!!!
Yeah swap girls with your jesusness
lel napoleon
IDEA:
-.-
*Nullz
:p
Viperidae: what?
Tell them if they have sex with you
Huh?
Tell them what?
Your father will put in a good word with his man, JC
It'll grant them 1,000 sheep
Like indulgences! Except for sex!
:O
:O
WEll
This concludes our fireside chat
This is your president, signing off
Or just rub there face with $100 untill they start sucking your dick
or a cross
Oh one more thing
Reagan
What
say its holy to have sex
Don't become like the Obama family and make these vacations a regular thing you here!
*hear
LOL
Goodbye gentlemen (this is actually really sad for me)
Aww
HWY
Goodbye old sport
:'(
U get teh fuq teh pussies
<3
So, what should be my GC threshold/
*?
30 seconds?
I don't think it works like that
e = mc2garbagecollector
I think most garbage collectors wait until you allocate a certain amount of data before kicking in
300 mb
1337mb
that might be a bit to much
1337kb
How about 1 GB?
Why not?
Because its good for a language to be able to work on a super low spec machine
So maybe in the future his language might be used to control a stoplight
Then 1 B
yes 1b
xD
That's a lot, right?
B = Billionbyte!
obviously
no but really probably 100kb
Gotta eat.
Bye Nullz
I'll probably make it kick in at 128 KB xD
Oh.
Or 128 billionbytes
which I guess are just gigabytes?
right...?
:|
no?
.
My mom just told me African Americans and Indians have privilege over whites.
That's a hairy subject area to get into
Lol does your mom happen to listen to Micheal Savage?
Theres an amount of truth to that..?
No country 100% all the time
Kind of, but also not kind of.
There are stupid things like affirmative action, race quotas, ect.
I just kinda laughed for a little bit.
Does your mom listen to Michael Savage?
No
Ah, ok my dad had The Savage Nation on the car and he was talking about that, and making really stupid generalizations like certain races hate America, ect
.
I hate it when people are truly racist.
Yeah
I might say sup nigga or something but I don't mean it in a racist way(i used to say that alot, but didnt mean it like that)
Of course
When its like Dem damn black people! Coming ot america just to terrorist us!
Thats dump :p
dumb*
so wyd?
I'm working on Iodine right now
Nice :D *remembers your doing the garbage collector* Hows that going?
That works :)
Hopefully I'll have a nice little working Iodine version next weekend
Hahaha, it's awesome how I can dynamically add functions to existing objects when ever I feel like it
I can do this http://pastebin.com/1dMx24tc
I know right thats amazing!
I can't wait until I have closures
That will be hard to implement though at runtime
*has no clue what that is*
Basically, I'll be able to do crazy stuff like http://pastebin.com/FznDc4cc
opps
bad http://pastebin.com/PUtPLws1
(Ignore that bad0
*)
Holy shit you type fast
But yeah I haven't learn about Lama yet
Lamba*
Basically
A lambda expression lets you dynamically define a function at runtime.
Nullz: Have you ever used Thread.Start() in C#?
I've only messed with threads in visual basic.
Same thing
You know how Thread.Start requires that you pass a function to it (Like Thread.Start(myFunction));
yes
In C#, using Lambda expressions instead of passing an already defined function you can do this
Thread.Start( () => {
while(true) {
Console.WriteLine(Hello, World);
}
});
That basically creates a function right then and there (This is called an anonymous function) that just does that while(true) { Console.WriteLine .... }
Oh, thats awesome.
That's also something called a closure. A closure is basically a function thats inside another function, that can access all the variables from the parent function.
I've spent the last six hours outside drinking sangria with my friend.
I'm gonna go to sleep :D
Noice!
Goodnight
Goodnight :D
.
I know
That's why I'll do header + content
Heya
Like pachets in TCP
Hella
Uhm, TBK it really isn't that hard to come up with something like NBT
I know
I don't think NBT is that special or either
*either
Are we talking about games? NBT tags suck
But when it comes to Notch and how poorly Minecraft is made...
You are crazy...
Splitty_ is?
Yes
Why :D
NBT is beautiful
hi splitty_
Not really
o_0
Hey Ichiru
Now, we are talking about how the hell I make a nice file format for my game engine to use for everything
I was thinking about some sort of file format then gzip it and change it's extension too
And do the same for resources like images and scripts
Unpack them at runtime
put it all in a big zip file :D
No.
Well, I could do that, but it'd be weird
quake 3 did it
splitty_: Want a quick nice project?
So did Binding of Isaac classic and Rebirth
Honestly, I'd look for more inspiration from formats like Halo's .map. From my experience as a Halo modder, that format is really logically sound and efficient. Of course if you've never done Halo modding then you probably have no idea what that format is like xD
Can someone with linux run this: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4843666/coreclr_game.tar.xz
You need SDL2 installed
I really don't want this to be only for the maps
I want it to be a general file for storing anything
From saves to a simple hello string
splitty_: Get your ass back here
uhm
What project?
why not just download a json library for C#
The Halo engine strings is a map file xD
*With the halo engine strings are a .map file
I don't want json, really, I do NOT want JSON
^
Fuck json
TheBrokenKeeper Newtonsoft.JSON is awesome
Or use CSON.
CSON is beautiful
Soo... splitty_... Wanna please make a custom compression system and such for me? Closed source please?
Closed source? Fuck you
No.
xP
No.
why would you make your own compression algorithm ._.
^
Not if it is closed source.
Security by obscurity never helped anyone.
666
What if you get 5% of the profit?
*^^^
x)
(To splitty, not TBK and his greedy self)
TheBrokenKeeper I'm not interested in money :D
so... did anyone click my link?
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4843666/coreclr_game.tar.xz < just need to see if it runs
it should give you a red screen
I really want something closed source in my engine. The content compiler thing HAS to be closed source
read up on the xnb file format
I don't want files to be decodable
That's why I want a custom format
TheBrokenKeeper: You are now an enemy of me
And closed source
TheBrokenKeeper: https://www.dropbox.com/s/p1qznthawvse2oc/XNB%20Format.docx?dl=0
I wan't it to be a first party format
lol Ichiru it can't find System.Console
Details won't be released
oh
In SDL2.Load
TheBrokenKeeper: Release source or specifications or die
splitty_ Copy everything in coreclr-linux to the main directory
TheBrokenKeeper, just use CSON or JSON. That's widely accepted.
I'm pretty sure I included System.Console.dll
The filenames are weird
Well then..
I didn't even do that
So
Yeah
xD
splitty_ It's Microsoft's CLR :P
lel
Did he really just rage quit?
Ichiru, another exception in BubbleEngine.Platform
FileLoadException: Can't find System.IO.FileSystem
:|
I copied everything
Is System.IO.FileSystem.dll in the directory?
yeah
TheBrokenKeeper: I will reverse any game you make and release an open source modding kit
xDD
odd
Viperidae, +1
the corefx libs are supposed to be platform independent
Yeah.
It's weird
Viperidae: You won't need to
As all my games will have open source modding kits
I'm no Mincraft
As the whole engine will be open source and for free, you know?
You just said you want to make the content compiler closed source
12:56 <TheBrokenKeeper> I really want something closed source in my engine. The content compiler thing HAS to be closed source
I will write an open source content compiler
Good job reverse engineering the format
splitty_ I guess I'll actually have to make a proper linux distribution of it
TheBrokenKeeper: Keeping that information proprietary is unethical
+ not just copy over the mac libs :P
And doing a disservice to your users.
And flat out evil
splitty_ run mono main.exe :P
Welcome back, NikxDa.
Viperidae: Tools to open the files, edit them and everything will be wide in the open
Even tools to decode the whole file and save it decoded
But I'm not sure on that idea
Also, this is my game engine, so I do what I want
I'm not forced to listen what someone tells me if I don't want to
Your game engine should be entirely open, and I will make it my MISSION to reverse engineer anything that isn't open; because I'm ethical
Well go ahead and do that with encrypted files
Your evil
If your going to do that
I'm sorry, but you are unethical and an enemy of the open source movement
Just because of you, decoding files will require a one-time use key from a server
Or, arguably, it's evil not to allow him to benefit from his own work
It's only your fault
Thank you Aurora
Viperidae, puttin two years of work into something and gaining nothing from it is not fun
As the engine will be FREE as in free beer for everyone
That means your a greedy capitalistic pig.
#Communism
I don't see a reason why I can't have something private
WE WILL TEAR DOWN YOUR TREACHEROUS BUREAUCRACY AND INSTATE A NEW ORDER IN THE NAME OF OUR BELOVED LEADER, KIM JUNG UN
Well, admittedly it's more convenient if the project is fully open so you can easily adjust stuff if it doesn't work well
lel
Everybody, int0x10 will now practice marxism
There
Glorious Leader Viperidae, for equality reasons we must give everyone operator status so that they are all equal
Or, remove operator status from everyone
+1
my dns keeps fucking up
Aurora01, the whole engine will be free, file formats will be encoded by the author. So copyrighted work will not be able to be freely sold around on the web
EQUALITY
FR
*FOR
ALL
!!!!!
How is banning me equality?
That was Ichiru
BLAME ICHIRU
Oh, true
Everyone is equal, I'm just a little more equal than all of the others
There we go
There, equality for all.
Better?
You were faster than me...
You guys need to learn when I'm being serious or not xD
hm
Although
I wonder how I should manage config
^^
I'll be honest with you, the difference between me being serious or not is sometimes hard to tell
xml is yucky
but json might be overkill
YAML?
for storing screen resolution
Ichiru take a look at CSON :D
I might just go key=value
https://github.com/bevry/cson
TheBrokenKeeper though, in all seriousness you don't have to have to hide the format. Just use some sort of cryptography that the developer using your engine would utilize to hide their shit
key=value is the hardest to fuck up
Each developer has there own key, ect. Security though obscurity is not security.
*their
and if the file does get fucked up I'll load sane defaults
Encryption with a one time use key generated by a server
Resolution: [ Width: '1920' Height: '1080' ]
Games released with the engine which want private resources will have to be registered to my server
This should be up to the developer though, this shouldn't be something you do to control all the people who use your engine
That would be unethical
splitty_: A user would probably fuck that up
If you want your resources to be private, just register your system
Viperidae that's what I told TheBrokenKeeper in a pm a few minutes ago lol
lol
I know
I might try cson for stuff that users aren't supposed to edit
To make provide a way to encrypt using a key
That's where I'm quoting from XD
-make*
Not quoting exactly
But still, the keys will be provided by my own server, one time use only
That's suboptimal
Forcing developers to use your server takes away a good amount of freedom(TM)
True, but I need a reason to steal 5% from their profits, don't I?
lol
Ichiru, I'll write a CSON-library
Isn't there already a C# library for it?
There has to be one
Nope there is just a CoffeeScript library
I found nothing matching CSON on the NuGet repo
:O
damn
var config = new KeyValueFile (engine.config);
int width = int.Parse (config [ResolutionWidth]);
int height = int.Parse (config [ResolutionHeight]);
easiest config ever :P
Interesting
Ichiru: There is no reason to steal profits. Infact, if that is your intention that that's pretty evil. You should charge for commercial licenses, without stupid DRM to ensure they paid.
opps
+1
I meant TheBrokenKeeper
x)
and non commercial licenses should be free
I don't care about the way the person distributes it
My way of P/Invoke is pretty cool
Viperidae, the whole fucking engine is free
Can P/Invoke be cool?
xD
it can be
For commercial and non commercial...
This P/Invoke isn't compiled-in
But you are too ignorant to listen
lol
dlopen woo
Then what the hell is this bullshit with keeping some key to steal profits
You, as a game developer, pay $100k to a company to make you art assets
And some dick decides to release all of those for free
There goes your money
All the money you spent, all out there in the open
That is NOT how it works at all
But ok...
So the developer needs a way to secure their assets
Also, look at torrents
That's how it works
Look at all the game on the face of the planet, all the movies, all the everything
Everything is free for everyone
So please don't talk me about people following copyright rules and such
the games + movies that make millions of dollars?
(except that one that made $607 the opening weekend, that was hilarious)
^^^^
Cinemas and steam
If you make a good game, you'll make alot of money regardless if people pirate it or not
But this is a game engine
I need to provide a way for the user to encrypt their data if they want
Honestly, I don't even think that's necessary. If the game is popular, someone WILL reverse it. That is a fact
And by game I mean any game that uses your engine
And if you want to generate your own keys for assets, pay a small licensing fee for projects that have made a profit of over $3k
even with Steam
Ichiru, I currently have 3 Steam games torrented
So I know that they are easy to break
Even though I have 237 games, those 3 missing from 24
And you shouldn't have to pay to use your own assets, and any sane developer would just implement their own form of DRM instead of paying you
240 I need
You pay the licensing fee, I give you the server to generate your own keys
It's as easy as that
They should be able to use their own server
I'm here.
Exactly
Without having to pay you diddly squat.
I give you all the files to generate your own keys
Viperidae, what are you, socialist?
For projects with under $3k profit, it's free
capitalism ftw.
Here's what you do, build your own cloud service.
If you have over $3k of profit, pay a small licensing fee for the key generator and you can host your own keys
You host the server.
They pay.
But under 3k, you are forced to use my own server
$300/month.
That's VERY stupid TheBrokenKeeper
Why is that stupid?
Because NO ONE will bother with that
And they would just avoid using your DRM encryption anyway
Look at UE4, free for projects with under 3k profit
That's the entire engine
Like I said earleir
*earlier
Libre.
When's the last time you looked at how the game industry works?
Pay for commercial usage, free for non commercial usage.
Ex-fucking-actly
You are either ignorant or cannot read english
No, I'm not....
I'm talking about the engine
YOU
The engine is FREE
Everything is free
If you want to make your assets private, it's free for projects under 3k profit
It's that simple
So non commercial is free, very small commercial is free
Are talking about hosting cryptographic keys on some server and having them pay for it, which NO ONE will do
You want to know what a developer who wants private assets will do?
They use your engine, and use the none private assets.
Then write their own wrapper
You don't pay for keys
That uses their own form of DRM
I said to host keys
You pay a fee to license a game under my engine
And in return you get all you need to generate your own keys
The whole server
You just said the engine is free...
Yes
as in beer.
For projects under 3k
You're very confusing and not making any sense
Also
That is not free
The engine is free for non commercial projects, and open source too
But if you want to get more than 3k from it, you need to pay a fee
And you are not forced to use my own way of encoding files
How much?
Not much
Either 5% of the annual profit or something else
Your soul?
^
Maybe
Hmm.
Nice.
I'll keep in contact with you.
That's exactly what I've been saying, but when I say that you tell me that it is free and say you plan on making money by hosting cryptographic keys on some server that people who plan on making more than 3K profit who want private assets.
Wait.
I'm a businessman, I don't have a soul, silly me.
Then entire time TheBrokenKeeper you've been making it look like the engine is libre, and the only thing that costs money is hosting cryptographic keys for private assets
The only thing that costs money is making money with it
http://puu.sh/insQP/b6cb9b3b78.png
Well, you better find a lawyer then!
Isn't this scanner sexy
Very simple
Yeah
It's just the basic structure
CDN/SSL - $400/month
Dedicated Servers - $200/month.
Domain name/SSL - $30/year
Security auditing - $1000/audit
It's pretty cheap
TheBrokenKeeper: I think we've been misunderstanding each other, because I've been under the impression based on what you said that you will only charge for hosting these keys for people who want private assets
No
Because when I said that you should just charge for commercial use, you said
3:25 <TheBrokenKeeper> I don't care about the way the person distributes it
13:25 <Ichiru> My way of P/Invoke is pretty cool
13:25 <TheBrokenKeeper> Viperidae, the whole fucking engine is free
If you want to make your own non-commercial game with private assets, just register your game on my server and you can receive free keys
Viperidae, leave Ichiru out of this.
He's just a boy.
^
i'm too busy writing gl bindings
When you say free, I mean actually free; not free as in beer.
No one was talking to you /s
But if you want your keys to be private and everything private, just get over 3k profit, pay me the fee and you are fully private. I give you all the tools you need to place on your own server and generate keys
So you and I both have a different definition of what free means
Hence the misunderstanding
You sometimes are too focused on your idea that you don't understand what the person is trying to tell you
Also Splitty, just curious I've noticed you use alot of static code in your projects?
And it happens very often with things like this
I would usually implement scanner as an object, as I think a scanner should have state (Position, input source code, token list, ect)
^
Well, TheBrokenKeeper I said basically what you said (That you should charge for commercial use) and you seemed to be correcting me stating that the engine is free, so it would be fair for me to assume you plan on making money elsehow
Well, currently the engine is very free and open source for everyone
Viperidae, use the What would Stallman do card.
I pull that on TheBrokenKeeper alot actually
Stallmann would scream at me for using a non-free OS
^^^
https://stallman.org/rants/chronosengine.html
^^^^^^^
but he probably wouldn't be using IRC
Ichiru and your non-free hardware.
since he gets his html pages
by sending an e-mail to a server?
Via email
Yeah
He uses links to view it.
his life sounds so inefficient
He uses public computers of web searches and stuff.
That's because the technology world has changed.
Stallman is a man of principle
We're losing out privacy, one website at a time.
Very admirable.
We're losing our freedom, one software at a time.
He just has to balls to not live with convenience.
no function should have 9 arguments
Right now the only proprietary software I use directly is jetbrains, then there is some proprietary MPEG decoders and Chrome's flash player; but that's about it
what editor?
oh
lol
CLions
CLion*
Why did I just say Jetbrains xD
I use the proprietary PyCharms because of it's amazing Django support.
Linux proprietary stuff: Games, nvidia, skype, flash
Mac proprietary stuff: pretty much everything
Even Xamarin counts
I just use CLion because it does a good job of keeping my source separate from any project files, and works wonderfully with CMake
Jetbrains make the best IDEs.
Have you used the local history thing?
Indeed
I need to make an xbuild config
Yeah, occasionally (It saved me a few times) but I also have a git repo too
That uses my weird corefx compilation system
It helped me a lot when I was writing that OS
Luckily my Macbook uses an Intel GPU, Ichiru so with Linux I can use the open source driver. However, the Wi-Fi card is proprietary (hence Fedora does not ship with it)
I had to install broadcom-wl
Likewise.
I don't use CLion for OSDevelopment
I use Geany for OSDevelopment
kmod-wl to be exact.
I grabbed a usb-ethernet adapter from a wii x)
bacon: Get yourself Pharlap
I'm fine.
If I could figure out how to do OSDev with cmake, then I'd use CLion
I uninstalled linux on this mac though
because I don't have enough space
Viperidae: I was just running make from CLion's terminal emulator
Windows support on Macbook surprised me.
Wait, no
They have a whole project dedicated to it
The only issue is Wi-Fi sometimes fails and refuses to connect.
I actually changed what happens when you press the build button
Yeah, but since you're not using CMake then CLion wouldn't use your code for autosuggest, ect
Tried older drivers.
True
I've been satisfied with Geany, it never gets in the way of anything
why does nifty charge $40
for a fking micro-sd adapter
I need to use echo 2 > /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/fnmode to make it sane when coding.
Therefore, I can use my beloved F-n keys.
I've gotten used to using Command+stuff
It's nice doing Copy+Paste in terminal
And then going to Control+C to quit
I haven't, I have gotten used to the placement of the keys though.
I still hate not having an X11 style compose key
What Macbook do you have?
Retina?
Clasic?
XNU is an ugly bastardization of FreeBSD
At least it's unix-like.
^

It's bastardization but it's unix.
Running El Capitan developer beta 1
It'd be cool if Windows 10 dropped the NT code base in favor of a *NIX code base. Too bad Microsoft would never do that :(
It's faster than Yosemite
I know, I know.
Really, Ichiru... Hmm.
i got the beta off a torrent :P
I might try that
But, we might get an open source Win10
If only, Viperidae.
Also, it's really funny comparing Unix System V to MS-DOS
Viperidae: That code would be horrendous
s/cortana/bacon
MS-DOS was just a shell for BIOS
MS-DOS is a glorified bootloader
Everything is a glorified bootloader.
^
Fucking matches.
Linux is  a -really- complex boot loader
It's only a couple million lines, Ichiru.
Hardly complex.
Windows has so many compatibility hacks
You have to include manifests with your program
You know what else have manifests, Ichiru?
Planes.
For later windows versions to actually report their version correctly
I can't stand native Win32 development
Otherwise Windows 8 is the maximum version ever
Viperidae, I cannot stand p/invoking and Windows.
It's ugly.
+1
On Linux, you barely ever have to do anything specific to Linux. You're working with the core C standard library, and some POSIX libraries
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724451(v=vs.85).aspx
just wtf is this
On Windows, you can't do anything fancy for long without having to do an #include <win32.h>
You should see my wrapper around the console functionality in Windows, it was just ugly.
Windows you can't do anything
without an #include <windows.h>
That ^

Viperidae, how about kernel module development and installation on Linux compared to Windows.
insmod woo.ko
modprobe -R Viperidae
modprobe Viperidae
kernel module api isn't stable

that's always fun
You can make a kernel level level driver though with like no sweat
I spent like 4 hours downloading the WDK on Windows once

well
C# is a beautiful language within bounds.
when it comes to strings
I don't think its fair to compare C++ to C# or .NET
C# when interfacing with C#
Viperidae, GNOME notified me about a terminal notification.
is always easier to write than C++ interfacing with C++
I'm scared.

TheBrokenKeeper, if you need mental help, I would recommend you become insane.
I only get shitty russians
Well, you might as well turn to drugs xDDDD That's bad that you are trying to get yourself away from thinking though, you might benefit from a psychologist.

Viperidae, my position currently doesn't allow me to go to a psychologist
I'm sure something could be worked out...
Because, you know, I have a small cast, can't get out of anywhere
Nor do I need any of my parents to know my problems
Keeping these to yourself is probably harming you more than yourself
^
I have people to talk with
Are they psychologists?
One person is the thing keeping me from not going in a depression
Viperidae, I think he has ADHD, can you write him up a script for some drugs.
But you're already in a bad state to begin with. Seeking professional help can be hard, but sometimes we have problems that are beyond our control and our friends control. I'd probably benefit from some help right now, as I'm becoming increasingly more anti-social.
brb, I got a lunch meeting with the ADHD drug company.
xD

Sadly no.

I have a script for you.
Like, on my doctors bed
Take it, buy the $99.99 drugs.
HAHA
Does this smell like flunitrazepam to you?
And my bum feels really sore
My doctor gives me literally nothing although I think I definitely needed something last year, I was a total nutcase
It's normal.

I'm making pizza and it only takes 14 minutes to cook but these are the longest 14 minutes of my life I AM SO HUNGRY
Ok daddy
<3
Cameron, McCains?
McCains? I thought they just did chips
oh no.
They do pizza here.
Like.
HTPCs are expensive >.>
I had one not 3 hours ago.
This is, in fact
A Tesco pizza.
Tesco.
Tesco.
I am SO sorry
Supermarket.
?
Yep
I don't mind Coles pizzas (supermarket)
However, McCains makes the best pizzas.
I once knew a boy called Dan Coles
Likewise with Dan Tesco.
He was ginger and reminded me of Simon Pegg so I called him Simon
Wow.
Amazing.
He called me alien. Because I'm from outer space
He was in a film filmed in my city I think.

No.

Southern Antarctica though, y'know, where it's sunny and hot and stuff
I wish I knew he was here during the filming, I would have stalk & raped him.
Weird Al didn't escape.
I made him 'weird' Al.
Can't believe I just read an article about Dan Coles in Perth
Haha.
$487
It was 'Weird' Al Qaeda when I was done with him
for a pentium computer w/ a blu-ray drive
Allahu Akbar and all that shit
Thanks Cameron, that's pretty funny.
Ichiru, I have $487 for you, but it'll cost you.
Did Cameron blow up?
DINNER'S UP.
It'll cost him 487 rashers of the finest bacon
I.E. your extended family
Finest, so Tesco
actually
OUCH
$487, is a reasonable deal
Tesco Finest is in fact a thing yes
wow.

I was thinking that, but then
I cannot recall what I call it.
Want me to get my language?
I realized, that most languages just make for statements like
brb better go get mah pizza
What I call it for my language*
Read this while I'm gone http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-33107832
for ( <Statement> ; <Expression> ; <Statement> ) <Statement> I think
I would do a Chinese translation for Descant
But I don't know any internet-related vocabulary besides e-mail
Fair enough
Any translation is helpful though
I could do a shitty one with a dictionary
Good enough for me :P
Bacon, wikipedia calls the last part the afterthought
just gotta make sure your font supports CJK :P
That's it.
where are the translations stored?
I don't recall what I used.
Ah

Ichiru
That's what I called it.
I spent a couple hours thinking of a good name.
xD ^
iterate was a good enough name for me.
I stole it from some place.
Like, the future.
now to figure out
how to name the file
I'm guessing I'd name it zh-cn
did i fork the wrong version
i did
Forking hell.
how do i change branch
git checkout v0.2-devel?
You cannot!
You can but you have to pay
i've cloned the whole repo though
git checkout v0.2-devel, yes
Just name the translation lang-zh.json
Aurora01: Chinese has two written forms
Oh, that's true
HEY GUYS LET'S HAVE SOME PIZZA http://imgur.com/a/shKWS
call it lang-zh_CN.json
POSTED: posted
nope
The expression in the image
Aurora Chinese grammar will go
seconds_ago posted
not posted seconds_ago
Well, that's a small issue.
Would it make sense if you didn't include 'posted' at all?
Or is it necessary after the time
Cameron: 1) looking good
2) I will share my pizza pictures when it's past through my digestive tract.
hm
I don't have to include posted I guess
1) Thanks and (2) Sounds hot bby <3
bae, bae... why u ignoring me.
sorry
bae, bae... y u ignoring me.
bae, bae... y u ignorin me.
Yeah, just omit POSTED then, that'd be easier
Otherwise I've got to figure out a way to allow a suffix as well as a prefix
I feel like there's 100 different conversations going on.
That's because there is.
That was easily resolved.
Now, I need more food.
There you go
what context is
a_week_from_now
Ichiru, do you watch The Checkout?
used in
But what if pizza is actually green
It's a week ago.
oh.
from now.
no i don't
like a_week_from_now be used as in
in a week from now, this will happen?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMYXKSy2fb8 it's an awesome show.
They aren't used currently Ichiru.
You can just skip them
There's too much crust on this pizza ffs
It's just the library I use provides those, and I have to provide a default translation for English
Cameron, I bought a McCains thin crust.
This is stuffed crust and my step-dad bought it ;-;
This is why my mother's single.
and plus, why I buy all my food
You seem like you know your pizza.
Want to work for me?
You'll fetch pizza for me.
I know my pizza but I had to stay at home and look after my little sister who refused to go with my step-dad
So I got no choice in the matter :'c
Sure I'll fetch pizza for you bacon <3
I make an ace bacon sandwich too
Aurora01: also last edited
I know you do.
I have a younger sibling, but he's a twin... so younger by a minute.
Ichiru, just skip that
Chinese people will have to manage without it
:P

Trust you to come out first
I'd have thought you'd be too lazy to leave the womb ;)

But my twin was hidden.

Thanks for that.
How come a constant isn't tracked by python's garbage collector?
I mean
LOAD_CONST 2
Something like that, which would be int(2)
Enjoyed that video I did sir
Can someone please explain how gc.is_tracked(int(2)) is false?
There is no such thing as primitives in Python
Aurora01: I made the translation
It's saved as lang-zh_CN.json
how do I add it into descant?
So I don't understand how this integer object can be somewhere other than the heap (The local on the stack is just a reference to an integer object, right? python doesn't do boxing)
Ichiru: What language is that?
communist
TheBrokenKeeper: Simplified Chinese
And you fork it, get it on your fork and then you simply do a pull request
Can I please see it?
as in:
how do i integrate it into the program
You don't do anything
It'll automatically detect it
Well, if your browser is set to zh_CN, it'll automatically request that translation
Soo... you know chinese well enough to translate things? I'm amazed
eh
i know enough grammar that I can tell when google translate is wrong
and fix it
Ah, okay
Aurora01: I'm gonna update the .gitignore
to ignore DS_Store
Alright.
i double-committed
Ok, how the fuck is gc.is_tracked(hi + lol) false?
but oh well
That's just an immediate value, not getting stored anywhere
hi + lol is the concatenation of hi + lol
As a parser would be able to combine those two without asking Python for help
I submitted a pull request
True
I submitted it to master
fuck
No TheBrokenKeeper, that's not it
foo = Hi
bar = Lol
gc.is_tracked(foo + bar)
False.
ok wtf
I want to merge commits from me v0.2-devel
Well, it would look at the value of foo, and then bar, and simply the parser would concatenate those?
to aurora v0.2-devel
Aurora01: I correctly submitted a pull request :P
Thank you.

Aurora01: Do you have a server running the dev head?
Going to update it soon
Aurora01: Why is python's object system so weird
This is so fucking good: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44
I'm amazed by this guy
Viperidae: because it had a weird evolution
I mean
Why isn't a string like that tracked by the garbage collector
Viperidae: It might be interned?
Like in some sort of string cache?
Possibly, but string is an object?
LOOK AT THE FUCKING VIDEO PEOPLE!
Ichiru, what's the Chinese name for Chinese?
And Python doesn't have primitives.
Yay my tokenizer works
Aurora01: ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá
Viperidae: use dis.dis to see what the bytecode is
That might help
that's for simplified Chinese
I did? lol did you not see

Aurora01: If you want it to say Simplified Chinese (China)
Then write ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá (‰∏≠ÂõΩ)
My IRC client is mangling the characters
but I doubt people will do variants of Simplified Chinese
oh
Viperidae, I didn't get any of that
Is https://translate.google.com/#en/zh-CN/Simplified%20Chinese accurate?
Wait
I did
Aurora01: no
That says simplified China
as in china is being simplified
I just pasted that to prove that there are not some compile time optimizations pre-concatenating the string.
Thanks, Google Translate
:P
I know
the phonetic version is: jian ti zhong wen
Pastebin it
Actually, no, that's fine
I can convert the phonetic stuff with google translate
http://pastie.org/private/vhkb75hfnou8gacd4jq
Thanks, Ichiru.
Aurora01: How do I select language?
or is the live demo running off master
Live Demo is running of master currently
I will update it shortly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44 WATCH IT NOW!
Yup, your translation works beautifully.
woo
it may not be correct
Aurora01, I made an Australian translation
But if some confused chinese person found your forum
Message this cunt
They might be able to make some sense of it
xP
G'day {{ user.first_name }}
xD
What would the error messages be?
Bazza fucked up again.
Poured a coldie on the server
TheBrokenKeeper, I went to find this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCurBYI_gY
I found it via the fact he owns spacebar.org
But it's not written in Lua, nor is it for SNES
Lua's not exactly a feature to advertise.
Ichiru: http://django-descant.rhcloud.com/static/descant/#/topics
But it's the only way to script the Bizhawk emulator
Implement your own emulator.
Language settings are http://django-descant.rhcloud.com/static/descant/#/usercp
or find another extensible emulator
bacon, please don't
or code it in lua
I tried once to emulate a gameboy, but no.
It's saying my current password is incorrect.
I'm 100% certain it's 123.
bother
the replies translation is wrong
Pastebin me the correct one and I'll fix it
http://pastie.org/private/8ux6zot5tasaty7b3xsthw
Ah three square boxes
so many meanings
bacon: Don't you have a fallback font?
No, I don't need one.
odd
I installed the droid set of fonts
And I automatically got a fallback through DroidSansFallback
I might not have it
Fix pushed to the repo
ty
Ichiru: What's a nice font with unicode things?
For what
Smuxi
I don't use Smuxi
I know
I just need a general font
But it should handle unicode characters fine
On Windows it doesn't
If you have the right fonts installed
oh
But on Linux it does
On windows... try Arial Unicode MS
Don't fucking insult me man...
I need a good font...
http://puu.sh/inBer/0e0b0d36f3.png
yay it works
Lucida Sans Unicode
Droid Fuckman?
Open Sans or Source Sans Pro are both good and open source afaik
or Droid Sans Fallback
cowsprivacy
Source Sans Pro is awesome
oh
priacy
piracy
I misread that.
I used the examples. lol

I'd say sure, but my parents will most likely say no
We have relatives coming
At an unknown time
thats dumb
So my parents are like We need to get the house cleaned up!
time to strip the NLua repo to bare essentials

Seriously, Cameron +1
Viperidae: Monday is thou chill day
Yeah, I'll be free on monday (Except I have an exam, first half of the day)
OH YA
lemme pick you up
what time does that end
I need to look that up xD
Its the same for all schools
I'll be on my phone
ok text me the details
Alright, I'll just look in my planner
mmmm k fam
ok bye guys

Could he not have used something other than IRC for that?
Cameron, this is called progress.

He isn't even a skater though
But he has a sexy car.
Cameron, don't stop.
And I want it

So, I have decided Iodine will use a combination of mark and sweep, and reference counting
Objects that are not tracked, will use reference counting
That's not bad.
However,
I recommend you use the hit and run method.
xD
The object in the heap will have a one night stand activated, knowing as 'hitting', upon successful 'hitting', it will 'run'.
or the more ethic one.
The object will notice that there's some of your former gang members in your area, they disrespectful yo' ass, there's no way they'll be leaving. You hit them with your car, and drive off, while they're in a deactivated state.
Viperidae, I am building an Arduino sex toy.

The toy will come in sizes.
Write in AVR assembly
then send me the code
Haha, haha.
The sizes are in relation to the boarss.
boards.
Micro.
Nano.
Uno.
Duo (or whatever)
...
You get the idea.
Then the Lilypad for your first one.
So you guys know that Jacob will be gone 3 weeks?
I've been given the responsibility of supervising tel
Good idea
Gone for 3 weeks?
Yeah, he is going to Jesus camp
Viperidae, could you help me find where the fuck HTC stores it's theme fonts?
Phone web browsing sucks
oh jeez I have no idea
Non-voluntary Religious Re-education Center, Viperidae
Gameguy could help you
But he isn't here
Google?
Osystem/fonts
*system/fonts
According to http://www.droidviews.com/how-to-install-custom-fonts-on-android-devices/
HTC, not Android
These are special HTC Sense 7 only fonts
I made a mistake browsing the internet without protection.
I was looking at arduino boards on a site (dx.com) and...
now Google is displaying ads for Arduino boards at dx.com on YouTube.

Uhm
Android is an operating system?
You /should not/ need third party tools for this.
HTC is a company?
Is HTC an operating system also?
I thought HTC used Android
It does
But HTC Sense took over the whole Android interface with it's own theme system
Then look in /system/fonts?
They are different
I found Font.apk in the themes folders
Well I can't find anything specific to HTC Sense
You should know better, bacon
I need to decode one of them Font.apk file
ALWAYS wear a condom while browsing the internet
ThePhoneKeeper just unzip iz xD
Speaking of fonts
it*
I had a dream where my mom (She's blind) wanted me to read her something on her computer
But it was in a weird font
You sure Splitty?
yes
Viperidae your dreams are weird
So I started reading her equations to belzier curves for the true type font.
Vould you test that for me?
lol
ThePhoneKeeper: APKs are zips
I'm on a fucking phone
and?
^
I can't easily extract things
I can unzip zip files on my phone :/
Search for unzip on the play store..
Viperidae, linear interpolation is a turn on for me.
Ooooohhh *wink*
100% quadratic
bleh
CoreFX is broken still
i'll wait for a proper release before I use it to compile
Viperodae, no luck in the system/fonts folder
Unzip that fonts.apk
I must go now.
Goodbye, everyone.
Splitty_ first app didn't help
**kwargs - I have no idea what this does in python.
Ah
nvm.
bacon its for defining functions with an arbitrary number of args
I know.
I just read that.
k
splitty_, could you please give me a link to a good app?
It was weird at first for me.
TPK they are all bad. xD
But they should all work
I need one that extracts apk
Rename it to .zip
The fist one simply opens it
iOS - extract ipa:
ssh in
cd wherever
unzip ..ipa
^
Yeah, ThePhoneKeeper it might be easier to do it from the command lined

Don't have one
How to install OpenSSH in iOS.
Jailbreak.
Open Cydia
Who doesn't have bash on their android :/
Type in OpenSSH.
Install.

Scrub lord
Bash will already be installed.
Well fuck you too
ssh root@ip
Bash isn't already installed
password: alpine
Android uses ash I think
For iOS.
Oh
That's nice
I haven't done that shit on my Android yet.
To unlock it, I need to sign up for an Motorola account and unlock it
void my warranty but meh
I will do this and install a custom mod later on
note: do not run an ssh server on port 22 unless you want to be brute-forced
didn't get hacked but omg the amount of times people tried to login with root:password
Ichiru, there's is an active debate about whether to run an ssh server on port 22 or not. It's security through obscurity, some consider using fail2ban or whatever as a better method.
It's an inconvenience for me.
eh
SSH -P 1337 ...
running it on another port removes the spam
SCP*
Make sure it's not over 1024
why
Viperidae, what to do from the command line?
Because, it'll not be running on a privileged port.
unzip? I don't know if you have that installed or not though

STOOL.
I still want my warranty. I had to order my phone from Romania. In the US there is already a bootloader unlocked version
SAMPLE.
And splitty. I really want my warranty on a 1k USD phone
That's how much it is in Romania
My phone is only $270 ($170 in US), so not really much loss
(fucking good phone for the price)
Is it octa core with 3 GB of RAM?
No, because I would never need that much power for my phone.
Well, it's not a phone
Brb
ThePhoneKeeper
Yes?
What's not a phone
Yours
How?
^
I can't stand people who waste money on over powered phones
Viperidae, it's uber powerful
I can use it to write an OS on it. Play games, do anything
You can do everything... except
I can do that one mine

Haha
HAHA
Shots fired.
Can you play GTA V?
I'm pretty sure it's not ported to mobile devices.
has it been?
Nope
Then no one can.
But there's GTA San Andreeas
I'll be back on my PC
I can play that (and has passed it on) and the others, on my two year old iPod Touch 5G.
I mean laptop
The thing is
512mb RAM, crappy AMD CPU
AMD?
Who the hell would play a game on a phone
When
ARM

You could just get a computer
I don't play games on my computer.
I don't play games xD And when I do, I play games for the story. I find competitive multiplayer to be waste of time.
The GTA SA story was very interesting.
^
GTA SA is an awesome game
I like the one quote by CJ.
Um.
Fuck.
Anyone knows a better font than Lucida Sans Unicode?
I think I screenshotted it.
Can you be more specific?
xD
I didn't.
However, it was from the mission Key to Her Heart, where you follow a girl's car who works at the casino and ultimately becomes her gimp.
Luckily, there's always one guaranteed weak link in any security set up. The human heart.

Fucking bacon
nomnomnom
in my ass
I found one freaky font
splitty_: This one's for you
Cameron, you're drunk.
<3
Always
splitty_: http://puu.sh/inFUx/53f27274da.png
Ew
Who's that Cameron guy in your screenshot? He seems like a right laugh
I have no idea. Some old creep trying to creep back in
Jeez, this font. It's so fucking weird that I'll keep it
Cameron, please don't be British.
Even though it will require me to get used to it. It's too different
bacon: How much do you dislike that font?
and with a passion
#bringbackcomicsans
Meh
I'll keep it around :D
It looks good with my quotation though.
Indeed it does
I'm sorreh mah friend, wuuuud you lahk sum moonshaan?
lol TheBrokenKeeper that font
It's sorta cool in it's own way
But also weird
And hard to read with it
^^
For example, what Cameron said about moonshine was kinda hard to read
Yay, the day changed :D
It's june 14th
Fuck you in the future
It's still the 13th here
In 10 days, I'll give everyone Pizza OS. It will contain a malware like Anthrax that will override your MBR
And it will be in the form of a PPTOS
Aviv said he'll be helping me
Wait where the hell are you if you're 2 hours ahead?
Romania
I have a Romanian friend
Cool
I hate all Romanian people. With a fucking passion.
It's 5:01 14th of June for me.
Except for one person
There's one person that I don't hate
Is it my friend?
You?
But everyone else can go take one up their ass
And not me
:(
Aviv, how's Pizza OS going?
Uhm
Also, did you see the font?
I hate everyone especially Cameron.
You love me, bacon
If you teach me how to PPTOS, I got PowerPoint 2016 :D
I love the affair.
I am your trusty cooker
Your pizza bitch
Yup, I love that... but I do not love you as a person.
Because I am not of a person.
I am bacon.
+1
Bacon do not love.
Bacon is only loved
Haha +1 deep
I provide the mayonaise amongst your lettuce and tomato
Haha
im14andthisisdeep
imCameronandthisiscribs
I'm so MTV
TheBrokenKeeper: the preview version?
Yes
well
I was not aware that was available yet
lol
Also, I'm Broken. Nice meeting you all, now, you can all go and die :D
<3
So Romanian
I'm just kidding, I love you all
<3
Well, not really, but I don't hate any of you
You fucking love me you want my dick in your arse
Sorry I'm very forward tonight
/kill Cameron Sorry, I almost forgot the space
Cameron, as your wingman, FUCKING STOP BEING YOURSELF.
I haven't had sex since September so I'm out to bum every bitch in dis place
Bitch being bacon, repeatedly
oh this is nice: the office year finally aligns with the version number
Hahaha, Cameron
Not if their version numbering for the next Office follows that of Windows
It'll be Office 16.0
66.6
Office is released on a 3 year cycle
Wow Office has really irregular periods
So Office 2019 will be office 17
it's office 15
It should consider going on the pill
Office 2013 is 15
and office 2010 is 14
oh yeah mac didn't get 2013
and office 2007 is 12
they skipped 13
Preview of 2016 is 15 for me :P
lol
That's... not possible
I used System.Reflection.Emit to add error handling to my OpenGL wrapper :D
Wow...
//bat.bing.com/bat.js
TheBrokenKeeper: It's only 71 lines :P
:P
Nice
for the error handling that is
The wrapper is more than 71 lines
IKR
Ni ce
Is that 11 or 71? This font makes it very weird
seventy-one
So the second one then
http://pastie.org/private/3pp1qztonwjgophrf0aacg
if checkErrors is enabled, it injects CheckErrors() into each gl call
CheckError() *
Why not just juice OpenTK?
too big
You sure?
yes
i'm using a small subset of OpenGL with SDL2
Okay
reducing the tons of layers of abstraction means less bugs :P
I don't need 2 backends per platform to debug
yes you do
I think I might tear out MonoGame's png reader
nope
If you do that then you might have a segmentation fault
something like that
G'night ladies xo
Night too.
Alright so Iridium is now just using reference counting
Nice
splitty_ How easy would it be to render a gui
With only rectangles, lines, and text :P
Pretty easy.
Lines and text is all you need :D
Hello old sport
Whats up?
Not much, I'm trying to redo Iodine's garbage collector. Something like
for(i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
print i is  + i;
}
Allocates like over 70 new objects in memory, which I think is too much
Nullz: Do you compile your Python scripts in your engine?
Hey Nullz!
And Hello
Yeah viper, how is that 70 xD. No I didnt know you can compile them. Sup splitty
Well, it's 70 because it runs like this
i = new Integer(0)
while(i < new Integer(10)) {
print new String(i is , + i);
i = new Integer(i + 1);
}
Nullz: This is how simple it is: http://pastebin.com/sZPf57UU
Whats so good about it being compiled than just interpreted at run time? And Yeah I get it now because its creating a new string and all that. How much memory is that using though?
Compiled is always faster than interpreted
Not that much, Nullz most interpreted languages are compiled xD Like python
Python runs faster when its interpeted
I mean
the bytecode that is compiled is faster
This is IronPython
Oh, so its CIL then
It compiles down to MSIL
*CIL
Okay...
I think that CIL is faster than interpreting the Python code, isn't it?
Yeah
But CPython still compiles the code
True
Can you still call update functions in the compiled version?
But that doesn't have a JIT compiler
Yes
You can just turn your scope into a dynamic object and do whatever you want
hmmm If you compile it and theres an error in the source, will it throw an exception while compiling or when it's ran?
I have no idea
xD
I never tried
I tend to not make many errors, for some weird reason
Well, I do make logical errors
But not syntax errors and such
No one makes syntax errors
xD
Dude I make so many syntax errors in Python that I've spent hours trying to fix something that ended up just to be the syntax of my python script
lol
Thats why want it to also use C#
C# as a scripting language is a BAD idea
shh
It is
Unity does it >>
C# isn't designed for scripting xD
Unity uses MONO's thing
I dont care >> I like C#
Which still compiles C# and such
Lua is nice for scripting
Why is it a bad idea?
You can say the same about Unreal Engine and how it uses C++ the same way Unity uses C#
Too bloated
TheBrokenKeeper C++ isn't really used as a scripting language in Unreal.
I know
It's really made for huge chunks of performance critical code
It's the same as C# and Unity
I was giving Nullz an example
k
He said that C# is just a scripting language in Unity. It kinda is, but it's not really a scripting language
Okay, but still why is it so bad?
To do anything in C# you need to import things, get a namespace declaration, make a class, do things
It's a statically typed imperative language with very strong typing, requiring all code to be inside classes, and requires alot of code to do the simplest things
But in Python, you can just do things right away
Thats why you make API's :D
Well, IronPython compiled vs interpreted C# scripting... I'd go with the compiled Python for the speed
public class Something : SomeGenericInterfaceOrAbstractClass {
public static void SomeEntrypoint() {
DoStuff();
}
}
vs just
doStuff()
Well I'm including both so I dont see why it matters so much :D
Honestly, I'd implement my own language if I was writing a game engine (Just because that's fun). Bethesda did it, and so did the creators of GTA SA, oh and COD for some shit
But regarding C# as a scripting language
http://www.reddit.com/r/spaceengineers/comments/28j9qn/dear_devs_c_is_not_a_scripting_language_please/
I'll do that later. Currently, I want a quick'n'dirty scripting language
Viperidae: Look how great this is: http://pastebin.com/Cb1ggb6w
Cool, but shouldn't this all be stuff written in C# xD
Nope
Uhm, I'm pretty sure this should
It's already compiled down to C
CIL*
I know, but this is still critical code that really ought to be part of the core engine and not some separate python stuff
var texture = Texture2D.LoadTexture(classical_ruin_tiles_1.png, true);
dynamic texture_sheet = script.TextureSheet(texture, 23, 16);
dynamic map_meta = script.MapMeta(64, 64);
layeredMap = script.LayeredMap(script.map_test, map_meta, texture_sheet);
Anyways I'm gonna start a C course tomorrow :D
This is not critical code that isn't part of the engine
This is code from my game
This won't be in the engine
I liek it.
Oh, see what I'd do is provide some generic file format for maps that all games could use
Like NBT or something
Like we were talking about earlier
I'll do that
But this is scripting
This is the current map renderer for the game I'm working on to showcase the engine
Still, if this is supposed to be a game that runs on your engine I'd do it in C# and avoid using the dynamic keyword too much
I decided to go the route Ichiru said, write a game and shape the engine arround it
I can't
IronPython requires me to use dynamic
yeah ^
(dynamic typing is expensive).
Well, can't you only use dynamic when you are interfacing with python shit?
Well, that's all python shit you see over there with the dynamic keyword
Yeah, I only found you need to use dynamic when calling a def
Or instantiating a class
well grabbing a variable, and apparently defs are variables in ironpython
Well..
Defs are objects
Functions and variables are all held inside a dictionary named __dict__ inside the Python class
I mean
functions are objects
Oh okay.
Viperidae: IronPython is a *dynamic* language runtime
Working on specification on stuff for my engine so I'm not randomly adding a bunch of shit then realizing what i spent a week on is still a piece of shit xD
So I guess by definition it requires the user to use dynamic binding
When interfacing it... I'm just saying things like loading file formats, ect shouldn't be scripts
I'm not loading file formats anywhere
All that will be C#
Me and splitty are working on it currently, neither one of us have any idea on how to do it
But we are brainstorming
Things that should be scripts should be extensions to game objects, stuff added in levels, missions, ect
My gl binding is almost complete
Or a simple map renderer!
(for my purposes)
Ichiru
Should something like rendering a map be a script? Or part of the core game, or engine?
Not the engine definetly
If it's not a game-specific engine
Then script
As it's part of the game and not the engine, if the user doesn't want a map, don't force him to have one. Let him do things however he wants
What/
*?
The user doesn't have a map?
Wait
Are you talking about like a minimap?
Look at XNA, you've used it. It doesn't force you to use it's own map object
Or a level?
or you could completely ignore there being a map and just not use it...
A level
one could do it like unity
a scene filled with objects
And by game engine I mean the game engine that uses your engine
There isn't a game engine that uses my game engine
There is a game engine and a game
A game engine is the library I'm providing
Lol the specific code for the game usually has its own engine shit that the developers make
And the game is whatever the user creates
That's called The game
Inside the game you might have something like
I don't think that anything you create under Unity you call a game engine...
lol
Do you?
public interface IMapProvider {
}
ect
I would, I would just call it a super wrapper.
wouldnt8
I mean, I'm sure you have a different definition of game engine than I do
Viperidae, do you call a game you make in Unity, a game engine?
I don't think so
If someone just makes a game in unity, I'd call them a bad developer
A game engine provides you with what you need to create a game
Oh really?
They ought to provide a good abstraction layer, ect
But...
Viperidae: You have game-specific engines, like the Halo engine
I don't even know what it's like to use a generic game engine xD
And then you have general game engines, like Unity
Because the highest level shit I've ever use with game development is like XNA
it's a really weird mix of visual programming and C#
This is a general game engine
But, you can make a game engine in XNA
This is a game engine made on top of OpenTK
I know
And then you make a game on top of that
But not another game engine
As this is not Inception
Oh yes it is!
Cue mind heist!
Personally I'd rather make a bunch of awesome features that dont have to be used for the user instead of forcing the user to make his own features.
But that's taking all the fun away from the user
splitty_: This is for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W95uWopoO0
If thats fun the user then the user should make there own engine.
Viperidae: Could you pelase explain to Nullz why making your own things is fun?
The making your own features is what I call fun, I couldn't see myself using all of an existing engine xD
Also, Nullz. I don't want to write 100 games
Because that would mean that I'd need to write everything for both 2D and 3D
A normal tilemap, isometric, perspecive tilemap
So on and so forth
Then for 3D. Primitive renderer, model renderer, shaders
So on and so forth
Well, no, for 3D it isn't
That's also probably why I had that little thing with TheTimeKeeper about game engines inside game engines, because I naturally would want to do alot of the stuff that a game engine does, by myself even if I was provided with an existing game engine.
That's why my game engine will only provide rendering and such
So you can write your own things with it
By rendering I mean rendering of basic textures and sprites for 2D
Billboards, primitives and models for 3D
I'm writing the game engine for ease of use and fast productivity.
I mean, yeah that's your end goal but the fun is getting there!
ofcourse! But the users shouldn't have to do that.
Have you seen how many people use XNA?
It doesn't even provide a sprite
Or a freaking way of drawing primitives
You do that yourself!
I'm not making this engine mainly for the users but mainly for my self. Selling it to people is just a extra thing
For real now... You can't draw a line or a rectangle in XNA
You do that yourself!
And how do you do that in XNA?
Write a function to do it?
You have no access to the underlying rendering engine
All you can render are textures in XNA
and fonts
Nullz, MonoGame doesn't even have fonts
I had to use Ichiru's font renderer
>> Are you sure..?
Anyways, XNA is just a really abstracted wrapper for DirectX
I tried once to find how to generate a dynamic texture in XNA. Everyone said that you have to create an array of textures the size of a pixel
And I am 100% sure
Sometimes the MGCB compiler goes weird
TheBrokenKeeper: You make an array of pixels the size of a texture!
Ichiru. Please tell Nullz how there's no font support in MonoGame
You can't do that in XNA afaik
hold on I'll ether prove it to my self or you
Nullz, I tried it a few weeks ago
I couldn't load a SpriteFont
In MonoGame, not XNA
I know.
In the past few days MonoGame has had a lot of improvements
Really?
When the next stable release is packaged
Did they add SpriteFonts for Linux?
+ integrated into Xamarin Studio it'd be good
SpriteFonts for Linux has always been there
And did they finally implement that content pipeline tool for Linux too?
Nope
They've just been a bitch to implement
I couldn't load them
not implement
compile correctly *
So like recursive fibonacci sequence is like guaranteed segmentation fault in iodine xd
Great...
Good job mate, you did it!
It causes the stack to grow exponentially
Even better...
Just, fix your language already XD
Don't argue on here
TheBrokenKeeper: There is nothing broken with it :/
You sure?
Yes
The stack just can't handle it, and that isn't broken either
Soo... recursive function == segmentation fault... That's not broken?
recursive function = stack overflow
Get pattern matcing like Haskell's
Eww, no
So you can do:
fact 0 = 1
fact n = n * fact (n - 1)
lolno
Why not?
That has no place in Iodine
function test(0) { return 1; }
function test(n) { return n * test(n - 1); }?
Or....
Tail call!
optimization
Also that's factorial, and I have no problem with recursive factorials in Iodine xD
Did you know that in Haskell if you do: cat = dog would just make a parameterless function called cat that returns dog?
http://gyazo.com/24d6938cca838d755934a22745c43666 Did it.
Because fib does 	return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
the stack grows exponentially
Nullz: That's not on Linux...
That's on Windows
And it works perfectly on Windows
But not on Linux
You could of said that.
#TangoDown
Man, this font is weird
http://puu.sh/inRsg/b944ee0540.png
I created a linux monogame project and it still has spriteBatch.DrawString();
Aviv, check out this weird but amazing font: http://puu.sh/inRsg/b944ee0540.png
Okay
Did you run it under Linux?
lol
No.
And of course it has the function
But you can't load a SpriteFont
Viperidae: chunk(name, items(header(name, item), header(name, item))) would work for a file format
Fuck, I just noticed, I can't even do TCO on fib
Of couts all of that would be in a binary format
Fuck
Zero is a big number
1/0 is a big number
*explodes*
throw new DividebyZeroException();
int 0x00
1/0 is actually 0 for an infinite number of times :P
TheBrokenKeeper: Not, so...
It would appear that way
zero is half of infinity.
Numberphile sait it is
That wasn't what numberphile said xD
This is nice: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP9pnSXhibw
I watched that video
Really?
Yeah, the one by numberphile
I watched it a couple of years ago, I forgot
http://gyazo.com/8c7faf406c9fa1865dcfc10b92b98f77
rate my meme
He's showing how to solve division through subtraction, and when you divide a number (Like 20 / 4) you just keep subtracting the divisor until you get 0, but that won't work with 0 because 20 - 0 is 20, and you'll never get to 0
gr8 m8, 8/8
That was for Nullz
The reason division by 0 is not infinity though is because
lim 1/x = -‚àû
x -> 0-
and
lim 1/x=‚àû
x -> 0+
So lim 1/x
x -> 0
is undefined, as there is a gap between the two limits
ew
calculus
I haev no idea what that lim of anything is
have*
Is it limit?
Yes
As x approached 0 from the left, y becomes closer to negative infinity; as x approached 0 from the right, y becomes close to positive infinity. The two don't converge
I need to start doing things properly, start overriding the Equals and GetHashCode thing for things that require it
I love how everything for me is a thing, and multiple ovjects are things XD
I don't really specify what I'm talking about mostly
Viperidae: Is it bad that I use structs in c#?
For what? Sometimes structs are faster
For thigns like a simple node elment in a file
Well
Also, how does one implement a good GetHashCode function?
override*
The problem with that is, you don't reference structs by reference in C#, you reference them by value
If you had
struct Point {
public int X, Y;
public Point(int x, int y) {
X = x;
Y = y;
}
}
and did
bool areEqual = new Point(1, 2) == new Point(1, 2) I'm pretty sure you would get true
If you did that with a class, you'd get false
That's what I want
(Unless you override equals)
Well, if you were using Point
And your only sub values were integers
Now, would I go about overrinding the GetHashCode function for a struct with these fields:
public string NodeName;
public object NodeValue;
public override int GetHashCode() {
return 41 * (NodeName.GetHashCode() + NodeValue.GetHashCode());
}
Note: 41 could be any prime number
But make it a prime number
Or else you'd be likely to have collisions
Okay
I came across this a while on the internet, let me try to find where I found it
I also found this:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/263400/what-is-the-best-algorithm-for-an-overridden-system-object-gethashcode
Here
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2733541/what-is-the-best-way-to-implement-this-composite-gethashcode
Ih
*Oh
lol
we found the same one xD
Yup
There's a nice class someone provided
I'll steal nightcoder's work :D
itch
*Witch
Thank you. That's so sweet for you to say. <3
It's not nice to just copy stuff verbatim
I know :D
how will you learn if you just copy/paste
I already know how to do it
Simply get the hashes, add them, multiply them by a prime and that's about it
then whyd you look up howto?
I didn't know before I looked it up
Viperidae: Is this overkill? http://pastebin.com/w3HbSzGS
Uh, yeah xD
I never use those operators
You never use ==?
This has both Equals and ==
I use == for comparing reference
If you come from Java, Equals would be familiar for you
not equality
I rarely ever use == on objects that aren't primitives in C#
Interesting
Soo... this should be: lengthOfName, name, lengthOfValue, value inside a binary writer, right?
Yeah, if you wrote a string
Or anything for that matter
Even if you wrote a list, it will still have a length
I don't want to store a type, or should I?
I did for my format
Where should I place the format and how should I save it as? A simple byte?
Maybe after the name?
Soo... there's the name, type and value?
Yeah, or an enum
(Which would be cast to a byte)
Yes
But I'm talking about inside the file
Yes, a byte
I did https://github.com/GruntTheDivine/gcl/blob/master/GruntXProductions.CoreLib/Configuration/EnumBcfTag.cs
And you don't need to cast, you can do:
enum InsertEnumNameHere : byte {
Element1 = 0x00 }
Or that
What kind of dark magic is that Microsoft xD
Telling what type the value you assign the enum element is?
It's making enum derive System.Byte, I just find that kind of awkward. Yes, enums can be objects but its weird to see that happen at runtime (And the fact than enum is deriving a struct)
woo
got some basic primitives
Can we see?
Okay, now, I also store a node type
And I should really sleep
It's 3:42 AM
Soo... yeah
Brb, going on Linux and then I'll sleep
lol
There is a party going on in my house
I went downstairs to see what's going on. Now I'm drunk. gg

First look at primitives
Filled + Outline rectangles, and Lines
Sm√¥rg√¢s? dafuq
i was testing unicode :P
kk :D
Yo Nullz
Wanna play BO2? :D
next up: triangles, circles, and better lines
Sure
noice
Ichiru: What in gods name is a smorgas?
sandwich in swedish
Ah ok, I thought it was some ungodly thing
Yo TheBrokenKeeper I'm sorry that I didn't reply to your pm
I was downstairs, there is some kind of a party going on xD
srsly though
Theres ants in my room :/
my P/Invoke method gives such good error output
Nicd
Nice*
I love RedBull
I'll be sleeping no
now*
shhh
k goodnight
Night people
dlopen: dlopen(/usr/local/lib/libSDL2.dylib, 2): no suitable image found.  Did find:
/usr/local/lib/libSDL2.dylib: mach-o, but wrong architecture
Your making me thirsty and theres nothing to drink other htan water
oh
sry
Night
Water is awesome tho
:p
I drink water 90% of the time
ew
i have to compile a 32-bit freetype
for xamarin studio to work
I drink water 80% of the time. The rest is beer
Now, I'll sleep for real

Nullz I can't even connect to Sykpe
My DNS doesn't seem to work
Viperidae did you ever have this problem before?
I can't access any website
And I can't connect to Skype
Weird
Try ipconfig /flushdns
The Steam chat + IRC work fine
I did this multiple times today
It fixed it for like 5 minutes
Hmm.
What are your default DNS servers?
I even tried to change my DNS from the Fritz!Box ones to Googles
(Do ipconfig /all )
Before my primary DNS server was 192.168.178.1 (my router)
Now it's 8.8.8.8
8.8.8.8? Hmm..
Okay connected to skype. Took a really long time
8.8.8.8 is Google's DNS
Ah ok
This is really weird
Google chrome decided like
ay
I'm not gonna render
xD
Fuck you!
Nullz_: This is why we use clients xD
xD
Splitty_: Are you using DHCP to obtain your DNS servers?
is it still broken
:/
Nope Viperidae
I need to hardcode my DNS servers
Ah, ok.
ALso
My mother has that annoying Fritz!Box security thing
To control the internet time of my sister
I have unlimited internet time but I can't change my IP
What in the name of god is a Fritz!Box? It sounds like some ungodly contraption straight from the depths of hell
It's a popular router manufacturer here
Oh, ok
lol
It's fucking awful
They used to be really good
But now they just suck
I need my own router..
Have your mom get a managed switch, then setup a separate vlan for your sister xD
XamarinStudio's native Cocoa port
Is terrible
I can't open two solutions!
THIS IS AN OUTRAGE
though really the annoying thing is the constant crashing
I really shouldn't be mixing text layout
With rendering glyphs
but oh well
I'm gonna go to sleep
Goodnight
debugging opengl is not fun
my previous renderer worked
but it used lots of ugly hacks
This one still uses a font substitution hack to support all of unicode
But no layout hacks :D
next step: audio!
I've already written a library for this :D
oh dear, I can't debug it in Xamarin Studio on mac :|
i'll have to develop audio on Linux
Good.
I am proud, Ichiru
Just watched The Imitation game
Holy shit that was a good movie
yay
hm
I got streaming audio working
Next stop: sfx
:(
I've added more hacks
mostly to trash a thread without OSX's OpenAL complaining
hello
Update: added a second hack because sometimes Stopwatch likes to give negative times
Hello all, I'll be going to bed now

I need to create a simple vector-graphics format
everything can be defined in rectangles, lines, and triangles
+ i don't want pixeled gui art
Hello earthlings.
& Ichiru.
hi
Hello.
I want to make a small vector graphics editor
but i only know how to use System.Drawing :/
Same.
Haha.
I made a vector editor awhile back but it's shit
i just need filled rectangles
triangles
and lines
You could control the control points of the shapes, but it was distorted for some unknown reason.
The primary use of it was to make flow charts
GDI has a surprisingly powerful drawing library
http://pastebin.com/FKms5Xab <- I wrote that 12 months ago. Still working on the same general project. Wow. (Warning visual basic.. gross)
I'm going to splurge for the official arduino board tomorrow hopefully.
The kits are too expensive.
$200.
Why Arduino when you can have an rPi v2 with $30 USD?
It has all the shield-like things you need
40 GPIO pins
Because a rPi doesn't meet my needs.
It's not a micro-controller.
(plus much more expensive here0
)*
It's more expensive here too, about 100 USD
I want the board to do one thing, run my code.
But it has a quad core 900 MHz chip with 1 GB of RAM
It's still a computer.
I only own an Arudino Uno, it's storage space was way too small
If I need storage, I can get a SD module.
Can you run code from the SD card?
No, it's a microcontroller.
Then you don't have enough storage space
I won't be running uLinux or anything like that.
I think my Uno has 32 MB for both the firmware and my code
I want to learn it so I can get into microcontrollers, which are constraint to these limitations.
constrained
Okay...
How the heck would one make an encryption method that works with generated one-time use only?
one time use key*
Make it time-based.
How would one do that?
Tell me the setup.
I have no setup
I'm working with splitty on some sort of a file storage method for my game
And I want encrypted files with one-time use keys
Ah, this will require a central server, so no.
Which will be generated by a central server
Ah.
Will the central server send the encrypted parts of the file?
Nope
Then you're fucked.
They will be stored on the user's computer
All files will be encrypted
I need an algorithm that modifies itself each time you use a key
Maybe the old key determines the way the file modifies so the next key works?
So each use will have it's own generation of keys?
It's impossible because it'll be vulnerable to reverse engineering.
Well, if someone starts reverse engineering it, that one person can do it
Then, if you don't care... generate the key based on the time. If the time does not fit within the time limit, deny it.
Like.
two-factor authentication.
My bank token generator has a unique code.
It generates the token based on the time and the unique code.
The bank has the same unique code.
But that code would require to work for the duration of the person playing the game
HOTP
or
TOTP
I don't recall.
How would I make the code work for as long as the user plays the game?
If the user plays the game for 8 hours straight, the code needs to work
Um, load the files into RAM.
As I don't think you can load in RAM 30-40 GB of data
Ah.
You're fucked.
Honestly...
There's a way.
Homomorphic encryption
However, it's not yet suitable for mass adoption.
Then... decryption will be based on the serial key and logging into a server
Not if the cryptosystem is designed properly.
Then how the heck should I go about it?
r = ef(p, k)
r^2 = f
e(k, p) = sum(f-1)
You are either crazy or you think I know how to transpose that into code
oh no, they are nonsense.
I honestly don't know.
XD
bacon cipher?
/s
^
TheBrokenKeeper.
I don't know how it works fully...
but if I recall correctly you can use a random key for swap... so when the random key no longer exists in memory, you cannot recover it.
(with dm-crypt)
wait.
no
wouldn't work
Homophobic encryption.
^
+1
(it won't work because it's merely the encryption key)
I need a haircut
Cameron, my hair is still long.
In my pizza pics yesterday it was like folded in on itself about four times over
You lied to us?
wow.
wow.
wow.
I'm so heart broken right now.
I cannot even even.
</3
I can think of something else of yours which is still long
Brb gonna go make tea like a true Brit, who else wants one?
If you don't like Chai you can go fuck yourself
I'm aussie.
TheBrokenKeeper, I have an idea... you could have dedicated hardware!
/s
Good idea!
Then every indie developer will need to pay 100k to get an USB stick to develop, right?
-> picked Chai because it's tastiest tea
yup
yup
TPM?
-> later discovers that Chai is also in fact the healthiest
Haha
This NEVER happens
You store the key on the TPM.
Chai = best thing ever
and wipe it upon closing of the game
However, stallman is against TPMs.
Ugh rub my moist flaps <3 https://www.teaindia.co.uk/tea-shop/chai-range/vanilla/
Anyway yeah brb
bacon: If I write a string with a BinaryWriter, does that simply write a length - data thing?
Yeah.
I think so.
It's been awhile.
I need to test
How does one make a stream stored in RAM?
MemoryStream
Thanks
How would I go about writing an object to RAM and then reading it back?
Shout me a drink, if you really want to say thanks, mate.
Not knowing the object it is?
What type of object?
Serialization?
object. System.object
My own serialization
The name's Object. System.Object
Haha.
I didn't see that.
You could store a kind of object?
Wait.
No.
Exactly
Give me an example of the object.
Currently I have: byte, short, int, long, string. Will add: array, list, dictionary, tuple and custom object
Oh why is my router so terrible at DNS
I'm thinking aobut using a BinaryConverter, get it's bytes, write the length of the bytes and then the bytes
You'll need some some of kind byte.
But how would I convert back to the object from byte form?
serialize.
deserialize
That's the problem, C#'s serialization. I'm trying to write my own method
int, easy.
string, easy.
long, easy.
short, easy.
the rest.
hard.
array of any of those
int length
then length items
Found this: http://www.morgantechspace.com/2013/08/convert-object-to-byte-array-and-vice.html
Wairt
I need a drink, brb.
It's using serialization
Fuck
Yeah, I'll hard code shit
Who knew that getting the active page in django would be hard.
bacon: How the fuck can I serialize an object?
Should I just use C#'s for primitive types?
Write to binary?
Sure, I have never used serialization
I have used it once. I hated it.
bacon: Can I do a static implementation of a thing from an interface?
I don't know actually.
I doubt.
Nope
Umn... Let's drop the interface!
Or...
How does one make static things for an interface?
Could you use a BinaryFormatter?
I got mah Chai
numanumanumanum
That's what I'm using
What's the interface for?
couldn't you use a singleton?
Question: I downloaded Adobe CS6
public static Cameron Instance {
Is Adobe Audition useful?
No idea what that is.
I last used CS5.
eh it's another DAW
I have audacity + garageband
more than enough
I can't use a singleton
These are static encode and decode methods for thigns
so in total I'm only installing: Illustrator Photoshop, Premier Pro, and After Effects
totally worth the download of the whole suite
Audition is good
Not so much as a DAW though it's better for recording, bit like Audacity
Or mastering
i might as well just use garageband tbh
For a DAW I'd recommend Reaper
i already have that installed
Reaper is brilliant and has a pretty nice interface
Very cheap for a DAW as well
If only Adobe had a Community Edition like Visual Studio does
Use BaconRAW.
The RAW DAW.
It can DRAW too.
ProTools, SONAR and Cubase are good if you're willing to splash out a bit more and learn them
adobe illustrator is nice
Inkscape is good too
Even FL Studio is seriously underrated as a DAW, its strong association with EDM means people tend not to take it seriously but it's very powerful and intuitive
But it's a bit in the way
If you've got a Mac, get Serif's Affinity Designer
I stg I would buy a Mac just for that piece of software
i will never understand why proprietary software takes up so much disk space
bacon: WORKS!
All their failed attempts at DRM haha
I can serialize byte, short, int, long and string!
But I can only serialize one node at a time...
Now, I need to stick multiple next to eachother
But now, gaming time!
It looks like drawing svg is going to require a lot of maths
yup
I'll probably end up making some sort of SVG->Internal Representation Compiler
YO AURORA
Hello, Cameron.
upon examination of a simple svg file
It may be rather easy to render it
assuming a polygon will always have 3 points :P
Ichiru: What about curves?
And gradients?
And paths?
you have to start somewhere
and my somewhere is single colour rects, lines, and triangles
Okay
Illustrator generates weird svg files
I only have rectangles
ah nvm
I was saving wrong
Ichiru: Where does one find the format of an SVG file?
http://www.w3.org/TR/SVGTiny12/
This is the Spec for SVG Tiny 1.2
tbh I'm just making files in illustrator
and exporting them to SVG Tiny
Ichiru: http://puu.sh/ior7q/2ac77c0284.png

splitty_: nice!
I can restore the input 1:1. This is the first time I'm actually building a tree structure from the tokens.
TheBrokenKeeper, want to test Descant's theme switching system?
Sure
http://django-descant.rhcloud.com/static/descant/#/
Go to the user control panel
Then you can guess from there
Works
I don't understand how people work on projects for more than a week
To be fair, Descant is more like 2 separate projects
One in HTML/CSS/JS, one in Python
i need to read xml in manually :(
no serialization
splitty_: I'm half way there with the file format
Now, I need an encoding algorithm
That will morph the file after each use of a key so the previous key doesn't work
It uses the previous key as the seed on how to morph the file for the next key
Soo... are you up to the task?
hm
for paths if I get a triangulator it shouldn't be too hard
it's the gradients that are hard
Gradients are easy
Why is it that I visit this page when logged out http://django-descant.rhcloud.com/static/descant/#/topic/244
Then there's a reply button
For linear gradients just use shader hacks
So I click on it and it disappears
TheBrokenKeeper: linear gradients can have more than one stop
Same goes for the new topic button
I know
You split generate new triangles and such
So if a gradient has two stops, from each stop you create a new set of things
A new set of trangles or something
i'm definitely going to have to just take the svg file
and turn it into vertices w/ draw commands
it's going to use too much cpu to calculate it every time
Cameron, probably a bug
I shall investigate
Which browser are you using?
how the hell did i get an e-mail from localhost?
Magic
:P
The server is getting confused and claiming that it's called localhost
And email clients don't verify
i'm guessing
that descant does not work properly on safari
Not tested
Maybe it works
Maybe it doesn't
Why is Safari still a thing?
Either way, if you want me to try and fix it, I need to know what's broken and which version you're using
nope
it won't let me post a topic on any browser
it says error :(
Did you log in?
yes
Did you follow the verify link?
Go to the developer console and chek out if there's any errors
i'll try following it in firefox
Also what Aurora said
is it supposed to be a blank page
with just the title bar?
Sounds like something's gone badly wrong
Is JS working?
Firefox, latest version
(stable)
Firefox 38
Yes JS is working
^
Cameron, I think I know your issue, Firefox was slow in getting a reply from the server and so Descant assumed you were logged in
Then realised that you weren't
Ichiru, Aurora01, TheBrokenKeeper: http://puu.sh/ioslG/59dc2db469.png
Surely it should assume you're logged out, since the majority of visitors will be?
splitty_ :D
It should, but Angular is being odd
I.E. default buttons and stuff to display:none and show them when you're verified?
splitty_: Awesome thing you're working on
:)
It's set to ng-show if authorised
splitty_ Why windows though
But for some reason, it assumes if there's no response, that equals true
Because I wrecked my bootloader and because I am playing Black Ops 2 with my sister sometimes. :D
There must surely be a way of changing that
I will log it on the issue tracker to fix when I get chance
It will work under Linux too.
Your sister plays BO2, I'm amazed.
^^
I need to get the game jsut to see how good it is on a PC
My sister ran Linux until her laptop died
But I don't have the money
I have BO2 on my PS3. But I can't play with a controller
Ichiru, so is it still appearing blank?
TheBrokenKeeper: https://github.com/CallumDev/AudioSharp
For when you want to add music to your game engine
Instead of 'You've made it to the last reply!' can it just say 'No more replies!'? Seems a little pointlessly long-winded
Eh, I set it to that but Aviv changed it
I think for the Chinese translation I put it as
This is the last reply
Ichiru: Where'd you find this?
Also makes it sound like it was some kind of epic quest to get to the last reply which may or may not have seen me dead
TheBrokenKeeper: I wrote it
Cameron, well it was
Interesting
What can it do?
You have to battle against the hordes of bugs
In order to reach the last post
Easter egg: if you try to navigate away or close the tab before reaching the final post, you get a confirmation dialogue saying Looks like you didn't make it to the final post. Rest in peace. [OK] [Cancel]
Plus, my error messages are so helpful
Error!
xD
To be fair, I don't even verify what the error was
As long as the AJAX didn't reply HTTP 200, it just says Error
Blind debugging there
And you have to figure out what went wrong
To be fair, Chrome Developer Tools allows you to see what actually went wrong
Good ol' Angular
I just can't be bothered to practically double my AJAX code to write nice errors currently
AJAX isn't exactly fun anyway
Well, the alternative for me is even worse currently.
Since Descant is REST API-driven
So it'd mean that I'd have to write an extra HTML-emitting endpoint
Do you do any backend web development, Cameron?
Not much, no - I develop themes and stuff for Wordpress and I build any extra functionality for my clients' sites wherever needed but I haven't done any serious backend development
You should learn Django or something
bacon, TheBrokenKeeper and I all love it
Yeah it's something I'm interested in for sure, just a matter of finding the time
Yup
I've got a full time job, and out of hours I do my own freelance web design/development stuff for people, plus I'm learning to drive and working on a bunch of my own projects, mainly one which has nothing to do with websites or software development
What's your non-web design project?
Sex toys
Plus I'm trying to be more sociable because I basically didn't go outside last year and I was pretty fucked up by the end of it, broke up with my girlfriend and everything, so I actually try to see my friends now haha
What bacon said
Eh, who needs the outside
Seriously though that's a secret but I'm sure you'll all find out soon enough
It's cold and rainy anyway
True #england
Actually it's pretty warm at the moment what are you on about?
Grey though for sure
Raining for me.
:P
You're up north if I recall
Further up than me anyway
Compared to you, yeah
Of course it's raining for you
Not Scotland-level or anything though
It's raining here, raining moneu.
money*
Anywhere north of Birmingham is considered arctic
To us Northamptonshire peasants
Birmingham is hell though
Birmingham is alright
Horrible place
I saw Fall Out Boy there last year
And I'm seeing them there again in October (VIP AW YISS)
Also saw Korn there in January (with VIP again, wat is money lol) and I went to Spring Fair at the NEC in February as part of my job
Going to Autumn Fair in September too... So basically I don't mind Birmingham because I only ever go there to do cool shit at the big venues
xD
Capitalist... wait never mind.
This is the first weekend in like a month where I haven't cooked bacon
Such a let down
Argh, why is firefox so slow to fetch CSS
TheBrokenKeeper, what's your oper password?
Chrome does it practically instantly, but there's a visible unstyled flash with Firefox
bacon: 'secure'
I need it for someone.
Thank you.
Haha
bacon: As Aurora said

Proto appears occasionally
Tomsoftmedia never appears
Yeah he's some madskillz Vietnamese DJ now I think his software days are over
Aurora01: ahahaha
I'm also friends with forte on Steam
forte?
Yeah, forte comes rarely

I may be friends with some others but I have forgotten their names on Steam/FB
I'm sure I was friends with dodgeball once... And Azure
Azure comes
oh.
Aurora said that.
Fuck you, Aurora. I'm shipping you to an African Tribe.

Bring back some heroin Aurora
Back?
AURORA'S GENDER, CONFIRMED.

To the whole discussion
We need drugs
Just deleted the TDF group on Facebook because I was the only remaining member
HOW COULD YOU
Remember when we'd all insist Chrisco was a girl and piss him off to no end?
Or I'd get into huge religious debates with him
Where's Chrisco been lately?
I changed Zychro's gender to female.
Didn't I do that once on TDF then he 'reported' me to Simek for bullying him?
xD
We need to get some active people back again on the forum
Yeah, we need some people here so they can find my projects and make me rich
:P
jk
Idk he's super busy with life and stuff
He's a super billionaire now, Cameron.
Well.
In training.
He just needs $0 999 999 50.
more
Probably
Or just a devout Christian preacher
Let's denate.
deonate.
donate

Haha
Cameron, please no.
bacon, what sort of counting system is that?
Billionaire wannabe system.
ignore the 0
Which 0?
:P
...
First.
$0 999 999 5
Perfect
Haha
It turns out that Angular 2.0 will be released soon.
Which is non-backwards-compatible
And I've been using 1.4
HOORAY
FULL CODE REWRITES

:P
Hello
Hi Aviv.
http://django-descant.rhcloud.com/static/descant/#/topics test the theme changing there
And provide feedback, please.
The changer is in the user cp next to the language changer
I'm sure it wouldn't be too difficult to port over to 2.0 if it was worth the effort
Well, apparently it's changing a *lot*
Oh well, doesn't matter, Angular 1.4 will do.
Oh
Good bye for a short time
Viperidae: http://pastebin.com/QjwsPV97
This is a node
I'll have lists of nodes and then a root point for all the lists
Interesting
Overridding == is kind of unnecessary though
Because its a struct
It's for a good cause XD
How would you access a subnode?
Because I think there is a problem with this
Cameron, I think I may have found the cause of your bug
It's weirder than I thought
As you can see, currently nodes can only contain one element of type: byte, short int, long or string
But what about subnodes?
Apparently, it seems like ngAnimate was catching the hide directives, and delaying them for some reason
Viperidae: A node inside a node? Not yet xD
I'll do that in a bit
But why should I have a node inside a node?
This will be a terminal thing
Ah so it's your bloody gimmicks messing things up ;)
Viperidae, this struct is a terminal point
Uhm, /map/player/inventory. /map/computer/on ? I can think of a thousand reasons, NBT is like that
Map is a list of nodes, player is a list of nodes, inventory is a list of nodes
I haven't implemented that part yet
I can't focus for more than 10 minutes at a time
YAY
http://puu.sh/iovrZ/affb4b11fc.png
Cameron, it would have worked fine but Aviv removed the animation
It works with more complicated stuff too
Which weirdly seemed to break other stuff
Well then a Map, and a player, and an inventory all have to have a root node? Ohterwise is just bad design.
Viperidae: There will be: root, lists of nodes and nodes which are terminal values
They will be lists, named
But why the hell would you not have subnodes
Honestly, I think this is a bad design.
Tell me the use for a subnode?
Because there is just no reason what so server to not have subnodes
If you can store a list of nodes
You can make a list, which can store a node in it, or another list...
Yes, you can work around the fact that you don't have subnodes, but that doesn't mean you should
Look at Minecraft's NBT format
Look at JSON
Look at XML
If XML didn't let you go
<something>
<somethingElse>
<someTypeOfValue value=something/>
</somethingElse>
</something>
Then it would be pretty stupid
Yeah, it'd be like an INI format otherwise
^
But you can have a list...
Which is a useless format
list:
list:
item
idem2
I suppose that'd work, JSON does that
Can you have dictionaries?
All I currently have is: numbers and strings
I forgot to add floating points too
So yeah
Aurora01: How to make a stream from a byte array
TheBrokenKeeper: new MemoryStream(myArray);
Found it
Viperidae, pm
sorry, I'be been AFK
Viperidae: Nested nodes: http://pastebin.com/hW1jitBF
That might not work if you don't change it to a class
I already tested it and it does
Output: (test,Node):(test,String):Hello World!
NodeStruct.Encode(new NodeStruct(test, NodeType.Node, new NodeStruct(test, NodeType.String, Hello World!)), new BinaryWriter(stream));
stream.Position = 0;
Console.WriteLine(NodeStruct.Decode(new BinaryReader(stream)));
Viperidae, look
Alright, how do you access nodes though?
Like
I don't yet
How would you open a subnode, changeit, then rewrite it
Oh, well I'm saying you might have trouble with that
If you want to do somsething like
saveFile = SaveFile.Open(something);
SaveFileNode someNode = saveFile.OpenSubnode(something);
someNode.SetValue(something, 1);
saveFile.Save();
Do you understand that this is just a node inside a file, right?
I'll have to rewrite the file
I can't make fixed-length strings
Hello!
Fixed length strings are overrated, TheBrokenKeeper
I really don't get why I added subnodes
Because it's like common sense to add subnodes?
As if you want a subnode, it will be inside a list
As this is not an XML like format
But I'll keep them just to make you happy
Well then make an XML like format!
As you can see. There's no way to store multiple nodes
XML sucks balls
Also
WHY ARE YOU SO IGNORANT? This is one node. TERMINAL. Does the word TERMINAL mean anything to you?
Inside this, you won't have two items
You can only have one value in one node
That's it
Or multiple nodes in a list of them
Well then
I swear to god the next time you call me ignorant your day of reckoning will be at hand boy
Viperidae. Inside of this node, you cannot store multiple things
One value per node.
Why do you need subnodes?
Why next things? It's like your obsession of brackets
So then you're format is basically a glorified INI format :/
Can you store lists in INI?
Also, look at json:
I accidentally rewrote BinaryFormatter >.>
Ichiru, what is your opinion on TBK's save format?
i don't get it
{
firstName: John,
lastName: Smith,
isAlive: true,
Viperidae, this is not a save file format for fuck sake...
This is a general file format in which you store data
Which was exactly what I meant
thing: value
In JSON
Now stop arguing semantics, I find you becoming increasingly more unpleasant.
It's a terminal
That's not a node then
Then what the fuck should I name it?
KVP? There is already a key-value-pair
I really should be sleeping
bye y'al
Value? A node implies that it could potentially have sub items.
It can
If you make it be a list...
A node can be a list, but not yet, I'm wasting time trying to excplain things to you instead of working on things
For fucks sake TheBrokenKeeper, A FUCKING LIST IS WHAT I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS ENTIRE TIME
And I told you at least a dozen times that my file can and will have lists...
No
You didn't
You said nested nodes, that's different from lists
Uhm, no it isn't and I'll tell you why
17:40 <TheBrokenKeeper> You can only have one value in one node
17:40 <TheBrokenKeeper> That's it
17:40 <TheBrokenKeeper> Or multiple nodes in a list of them
You know YML?
17:15 <TheBrokenKeeper> You can make a list, which can store a node in it, or another list...
Did I not tell you about lists?
I know that YML exists, I don't know what it looks like
YOU made it look like there was one root list
Yes, there is one root list, in which everything goes
And that just has key value pairs
No
It can hold multiple lists
And none of those key value pairs can be a list
Then I won't show you incomplete things next time
And the source code you sent me does not imply that you have lists at all
atleast like the ones you describe
I don't yet
As I said, incomplete code
For the past 36 minutes I've been talking instead of implementing lists
Well then I've been write this entire time. Subnode == list? I just said you should add that because the format would be useless without
You never said that a subnode should be a list
That's the problem
Oh
Uhm, no the problem is you refused to adequately explain what a list is, because I had no reason what so ever to think you were describing is the same thing I'm describing. I made it clear what I meant, you should be able to have a file that contains data in the structure of a tree
rootSubnode:
key1 = value1
key2 = value2
childSubnode:
key3 = value3
childSubnode:
key4 = value4
I call that a root list, child list and such
Well, they will actually be nodes containing lists
But you get the idea
Everything's a node
But it's not even a list, it's closer to a dictionary but I'm saying everything is a node, including 'lists'
With a root node being a list, and inside it can be other nodes containing whatever
ok
It's a list of nodes. And a node has a name and a value
The list is not named that's why you need to assign it to a node
But the list itself is a node!, just like a grouping operator like {} in C# would be a node in the AST
Yes

It was being tempremental before because the translate library wasn't returning the right value, but I'll take a look when I can
Aurora01 I'll do some more german translations later
Yay!

Thanks splitty_
Good bye now!

Node.js is actually useful for something, hooray!
But not for the thing it was originally intended to do.

You happy?
Actually, I am happy as they are useful
But still

That's the code
Looks pretty nice.
Now, I need to make the NodeList class better
As it has no wrappers around the list
I'll need to override the this statement... And that's about it
The indexer?
Yes
It's more an index accesser operator.
Okay...
unary of course.
postfix*
bacon: Should I use indices or the node's names?
um.
um
indices.
in my opinion
Okay, good idea
or both

Okay, good idea
and I'm too tired to continue giving good idea
my brain is turning off.

Okay
Suddenly, my game engine and game uses 41.1 MB of RAM instead of 53.7 like usual
And it's consistent
Each time I reopen it, 41 MB dead on, nothing more, nothing less
AuroraEngine uses a whooping 0MB of RAM.
Aurora01, here's $1000 contract.
Now... I should try and save a map with this format... But I'm too lazy. I'll do it later
Who wants to write an editor for these kinds of files?
A simple list view with editable nodes?
splitty_?
yes?
oh
nope
I don't do GUI stuff
WHY?????
Can you do a console version?
Display nodes?
Uhm
What would I need to do
Make a viewer and editor for my file format?
Hmm why don't you do that :/
I know nothing about your file format
Seems fun but too bad I'm busy
And I am working on my CSON thing ^^
splitty_: http://pastie.org/private/2zuppeghmhsx0pargskma
File format is here
You can simply use that implementation
Just make the editor and viewer
bacon: Will you do it?
no

Hm?

Wanna make a file viewer and editor?

Well, if you write it. When the engine gets money. I'll give your materialist ass the money
TheBrokenKeeper sorry there is so much stuff going on right know
:P
Afterwards?
Aurora01 I knew that you were gonna make a pirate translation for Descant
FOr some reason

You don't need to design

You don't make money by wasting money.
How would I waste money by helping people?
I don't need hundreds of thousands of dollars
Because, people are imaginary.
It's about you.
Jokes aside, I would donate to open source communities & fund development.

Okay
I would get all my friends decent places to live in. And give all my employees more money
If  you want loads of employees to make good things. Give them more money than everyone else
Sadly, it doesn't usually work like that, for multiple reasons.

Anyone else excited about Dishonored 2?
No idea what Dishonoured 1 is, but weirdly, it's something that I am familiar with.
Game about assassins
Promising field.
Well, an assassin... Based in some steampunk Victorian type era, you're this guy who was bodyguard to the queen of some plague-ridden land but the corrupt Lord Regent sets you up and kills her and everyone thinks it's your fault
So the whole thing is basically about revenge and taking back power
It was ridiculously fun and there were a bunch of ways you could play it
Cameron: That game is on my top 10 games
bacon: Get your ass and reverse engineer my file format. Please :)
Brilliant isn't it? Definitely up there somewhere for me too :3
Yup
TheBrokenKeeper, that sounds fun but too bad I cannot stray on my duties.
from my*
It's very simple...
It won't take more than 5 minutes to do
http://www.speedtest.net/result/4434728303.png
If that's the case then you should perhaps improve it anyway
Cameron: What do I have to improve?
Viperidae: That... KILL YER ISP BEFORE I KILL YOU.
TheBrokenKeeper, five minutes is still enough distraction from more important tasks.
The fact that it can be reverse engineered in 5 minutes?
Cameron: Splitty will write me the encryption part
Awlrighty
This is more or less a JSON like thing but in binary format
I find it interesting that you can play as either Emily or Corvo on Dishonored 2... That's hinting at co-op for me
Wait what?
Dishonored 2?
Dishonoured was ok, didn't like the lack of non lethal options though
I.e. sleeping darts or nothing
JESUS FUCKING CHRIST: http://i.imgur.com/TAGY2FV.jpg
Augment: There are non lethat ways of doing things

Aurora01, do you remember what mobo I had on my PC?
I said that I hate it a bunch of times
The Terribleboard 1
Found it!
No, it doesn't do anything about that, Aurora01
Aurora01: This is my shitty motherboard: http://www.gigabyte.com/fileupload/product/2/4385/6894_big.jpg
Haha
well, it'll go away in opera, chrome's just being weird about it
Guess they'll have to suffer for their browser choice
If Chrome is having trouble, Safari probably will break too
Plus Chrome is the biggest browser by far
It's just the input outline
and not by *that* much
48.15%
I'm getting a GTX 680 with 60 euros
Yay :D
The next highest is IE with 19.6%
It's usually 500 USD in stores
remember, Aurora01, monopolies are bad!
Fine, Descant, best viewed in Midori
lol
+1
Midori crashes whenever I try to open it
http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp is even worse for you Chrome-haters
Chrome - 64.9%
IE - 7%
Firefox - 21.5%
yuck
Chrome is awesome
May of 2003 seems like the best time ever
Ewwwww, IE6
The biggest abomination *EVER*
nuh
That would be Chrome.
Why do winforms suck so fucking much?
or maybe Vivaldi
Well TheBrokenKeeper, you won't need to use winforms much longer
At least Chrome follows standards properly
.. Ie does...
Not really
it's not like it has a million -webkit- things
It still has all of its weird quirks
Such as?
Conditional comments for one
lol
Those are gone
When did they get rid of them, IE10?
Aurora01: Update the Descant screenshot from the forums
It's old
Aviv, you heard TheBrokenKeeper :P
Important  As of Internet Explorer 10, conditional comments are no longer supported by standards mode.
ok TheBrokenKeeper
So that feature only died in 2012
:P
That doesn't mean IE now isn't standards compliant...
Loads of people still use old IE versions
So....?
That still doesn't make IE non compliant
Aurora01: Update the screenshot on int0x10
It's still less compliant than IE though
Take a look at html5test etc
TheBrokenKeeper: hold on
I'm holding on
I'm off to gaming.
done
:O Account pptosn.bxcweb.com is pending cancellation
As I say, Descantise their community
Yes, I've invented the verb 'to Descantise'
Because Descant is so revolutionary.
Is there any other Django forum out there
?
Yes
Misago
misago-project.org/
But is it made by Aurora and Aviv?
No
Then it's no good
Misago seems bad though
Descant is revolutionary.
Misago's next version will use Ember.js
and it looks like it is going super slow lol
I'm off to gaming for real this time
kk
Doesn't Misago currently use Ember?
Nope
it's just a static HTML page right now
Time to fix some of those CSS classes
.list-list really, Aviv
Such fun
.list-list is the best name.
lol
I think I'm going to merge forum.css and framework.css
Doesn't make much sense to separate the
m
and is this used anywhere?
button[disabled] {
background: #c0392b;
}
Yeah
On the registration form
Should Descant get a https://gitter.im/?
If you like
It supports IRC connections, so it wins there
oh ok
Are you going to register for it?
I did
https://gitter.im/Aurora0000/descant
Well, that's neat
Try committing something to the v0.2-devel branch
Okay
Should I be scared?
ok
I committed something
<gitter> [Github] Tel-Aviv pushed 1 commit(s) to Aurora0000/descant https://github.com/Aurora0000/descant/compare/3b5a2c06ba3e...b271a51d4a33
It sent that to me
WHOA
Anyway, got to go now.
Adios.
BYE
Hi!
Yay I found a nice new IRC client!
Aviv: What client is that?
Aviv: 23:19 <TheBrokenKeeper> Aviv: What client is that?
A modern windows one called IRC Explorer!
Great... KILL IT WITH FUCKING FIRE!
No!
YES!
Never
Modern windows apps are the future
no winforms haha
Is that a plus to you?
No.
I thought you hated winforms
Clickable console with raster graphics is the guture
future*
uhm.
You just go on and think that then
Fuck modern Windows apps it's all about web apps
lol k
Which, granted, are based on the same technology... But shhh
Cameron: Can your web IRC hold logs?
Cameron: You are aware windows 10 will let you easily convert your web apps into modern windows like apps?
I'm off to playing some Bioshock
kk TheBrokenKeeper
go play*
I hate my grammar somethimes
And I hate Viperidae's almost always
I'm sure there are clients out there which can but this shitty webchat on the int0x10 site does fuck all
I always hate it
Their vs They're
It has like 10 buttons
Cameron: KiwiIRC is a web alternative
Or you can use Smuxi
And I am aware of that Aviv, but why should we need to? Why not just use... **drum roll** the internet?
Offline?
KiwiIRC was the first client I ever used, back when I was 12
That brings me back
I only use webchat because I really cba to find a better client
Cameron: Smuxi!
I used to use ChatZilla back when IRC was a fairly standard part of my life
SMUXI!!!
Yeah but I have to search it and install/sign up/whatever for it... Basically changing tabs is effort
Viperidae, Aurora, Bacon, splitty, Reagan, me and many more use it
And what do you have to sign up for?
It's free
yeah
But IRC Explorer for windows is better!
You donwload it, install it, add the server and run it
Windows is bad.
Not!
It's more of you are bad at using Windows
You live in a dream world
I know how to use Windows maybe even better than you
Sure
I've been using windows since I was 2 and a half years old
That's nice
Let's say for ~14 and a half years
You can use something for a long time and still be terrible at it!
And my dad was working in the computer industry
I learned everything from him
I'm better than him now
So yeah
that so totally qualifies you
How are you qualified for using Windows?
TheBrokenKeeper is 16 confirmed #confirmed
Do you have a license?
I have a Windows license but not that kind
Didn't you know that I'll be 16 on the 24 of June? This month?
I
Well I do now :D
I will probably forget that so I'll wish you a happy birthday now
I'm expecting sa present from each and every one of you
I have this kind of license: http://i.imgur.com/J6Ir99D.png
Yay!
It won't be sweet
I'm stuck on my bed with a cast on my leg unable to move 1 inch
HOORAY FUN
Nobody will come to my b-day
So yeah
Hopefully the day will be kind to you
It'll be fun...
I'd go!
I'd come if I could!
Well, you still got plenty of time
Aviv, it's only ~1k USD
yeah ok
Now, I'll play Bioshock
I was in Cornwall over my 16th... With my family (not by choice)... Granted it was a nice holiday but on my actual birthday, I got an ice cream and a fucking seagull stole it right out of my hands after the second lick
Then another one pissed on me at the beach
I wish I had that XD
What city in Romania?
I'm stuck between 4 walls using a shitty dual core laptop
LOL DUAL CORE
For the airport? Go to Timisoara
YOUR LIFE MUST REALLY SUCK
I'll go talk to my Romanian friend because AFAIK you guys can all turn into bats and teleport so I'll get him to teleport me over there
Well, my desktop is a six-core 3.9 GHz, 8 GB of ram, GTX 660 and 680
I bet you miss it dearly
I do
The 660 is dedicated purely for KVM and PhysX
Oh, wow, TTK, the flights are even more than that
Awesome@
!*
not
Now, I'll actually do something... Wathc youtube@
!*
Or you could work on Descant!
**TheBrokenKeeper picks up a photo album with some heavy-sepia pictures of him skipping through a field with a huge gaming rig** Ah, the days when I had legs... I miss her so
Aviv: I can't
Aurora didn't teach me it's inner workings
Believe, and it will happen
Nor do I know how to web-dev
Just believe
or learn to web dev that could be fun
or
SIGN UP FOR AVIV's fun webdev course!
Aviv: This is what I'm currently watching: https://goo.gl/zL48vv
or use the youtube built in short link?
https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
Don't know about it
just click share
Nice
Like this? https://youtu.be/Rqz--Rf6IIo
Btw, this time it's a different video
GJ TheBrokenKeeper
With?
Youtube links
Did you check it out?
Sure..
It's a prank video. from the channel TrollarchOffice
No, it was not
I know :D
..
It was from From Russia With Pranks
ok
Oh no
GOIN' TA BED NOW LADIES, NIGHTY NIGHT, GET WELL SOON THEBROKENKEEPER XO
Soon means 2 months earliest

YEAH WELL I HOPE THOSE TWO+ MONTHS ARE AS FUN AS THEY CAN BE
NIGHT
I'll sleep now
k
Night
Night!
Hello all
Viperidae Augment  Augment  bacon Emily  splitty__
Am I really sexy enough that you have to mention me twice?
thanks m7
that was meant to say Aviv
but I obviously didn't get the autofill right
yeahsure
we believe you :v
Hello
Hiya Nullz
How you doing?
hi Nullz!
Hello
Hi!!!
not many people are talking right now lol
not any*
3 exams down, 3 to go
Hi Aviv, bacon, Emily, Nullz, splitty__
Nice, and hello.
Taking a C course :D
Hey
lol Nullz
Nice
I just wrote my first C program! #1337
+1
Welcome to cludo games, We will strive to return 0 better than anyone else!
WOOOOOOO NULZZ
I AM SO PROUD
lol
This course is really short
it only goes over the super basics
But you did it
:D
You're better than anyone! (except viperiade duh)
but vippy can't be beat
HE has a special thing
Most people here are better than me >> lol
But I'm catching up! :D
Hello world
>> I now realize it wouldn't be so bad to have C as a scripting language in my game engine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-b6w4Nog5E
This video is so true
And Nullz, don't do that.
C as a scripting language doesn't work.
Most developers won't be professional C devs and they will make really problematic decisions.
^
yeah
Aviv a good amount of people here can write C code :D
Yeah I think everyone here other than me and Aviv know C and C+
C++*
I know C++
I use it every day
Really
I don't
I don't know C++
I do know C--
Much error
I dont understand tsi
I dont know what I did wrong but it works now
Wait, can y--- oh oh oh I tried to make a class constructor on accident lol
◊§◊¢◊û◊ô◊ôÔøΩ? ◊†◊ß◊ï◊ì◊™◊ô◊ôÔøΩ?
Otherwise known as
PAAMAYIM NEKUDOTAYIM
Otherwise known as

Silly PHP being developed in Israel
Bye!
C isn't hard! So far!
already 40% done with course
Well C itself isn't hard
But pointers and stuff need some practice :D
The course hasn't gone over this atleast year
yet*
Why is it that I have to make a variable static to make it work? If I make a regular int data in one class and the same in my own class(something that'd work on every language I've used) why is it when I edit one it edits the other as if It was just a pointer to the same object?
Nullz you are confusing something lol
There ain't no classes in C :D
You can link them together though
Are you talking about headers?
./cl something.c /c
wtf
I have no idea what you're doing :D
Call me on skype
Can't, everyone is asleep
I wont talk
You have to make a variable static if you define them in a header and want to use them in multiple c classes.
It would be defined more than once if you'd not make it static
Yeah but why do you have to make it static?
OH
Okay. Imagine this: You have a js file that defines the variable x = 10
So you mean I can literally access te other classes variables just like that?
Wait.
Now you include this js file in two different files
x gets included twice
C just adds all of that together like it was one class huh
Yeah
Oh
I get it now :D
#include something just copies the contents :D
That's why you include just the headers, let the compiler find the classes and make things that will be included more than once static.
I now understand why it isn't object oriented, but it well I dont know how to make it can be yet
There is no way to write object oriented code in c.
But you can use structs to save/restore a state and pass that struct to a stateless function
You can if you know how to use structs! ~SomePersonOnThisIrcIForgetWhoSaidThat
That's how class-like things are achieved in C
I just said it. :P
And it probably was Viperidae
Anyways I like C but I appreciate C# more now
^^
okay its going over operators
I understand everything but then it started talking about >> and << and now I'm lost on what they do because what it says doesn't make sense to me
nvm
Nullz, it's bit shifting
1 << 1 = 2
2 << 1 = 4
4 << 2 = 16
I dont understand these words. xD I know ~ seems to make every value negative with a extra negative number
10 would be -11
2 >> 1 = 1
4 >> 2 = 1
4 >> 1 = 2
:D
Nullz, that's wrong
hrm
Well, maybe not in all cases
to numbers, yes~
<< = bitwise shift left
>> = bitwise shift right
~ = bitwise NOT
& = bitwise AND
| = bitwise OR
^ = bitwise XOR
With 4 << 2 = 16, that way you get this is you do (4*2)*2 ?
8 << 2 == 32
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation
Here
This makes it easy to understand
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#Arithmetic_shift
It's a really simple and basic operation
It's just harder to imagine this operation on base 10 numbers
In base 2, it makes sense and is very simple
K I sorta understand it. Why is this needed though.
Nullz, x << y == x * pow(2, y)
That's an interesting question. :D
are you wanting me to answer that?
Yeah sure
Multiplying/dividing using bitwise shift is faster than multiplying using normal * and / operators
I'm not entirely sure why
I'm not sure I know how to answer that.
haha
Me neither
Oh good I felt like I was stupid xD
xDD
Nope
bit-shifting is important. :D
You need it to generate hashes
You need it for polynomial arithmetic
You can make multiplication faster using bitwise shift
You can do floating-point arithmetic on systems that don't support floating point numbers
Also, it's important for low-level stuff
This all seems cool but I'm not sure I'm at the point where I need to understand it yet xD
Because hardware encodes stuff using bit-masks
And you can extract values using bit-shifting
Nullz it really isn't hard to understand
I understand what it does, I just can't see it used in a practical application
I needed it A LOT while doing OS dev. :D
http://puu.sh/iqDPI/0c6537de90.png
splitty___: Theoretically, you can do object oriented things in C
Even polymorphism
But you need to pass the instance statement
not statement
Variable
TheSleepKeeper that's what I said earlier
07:44 <splitty___> There is no way to write object oriented code in c.
You sure?
<splitty___> But you can use structs to save/restore a state and pass that struct to a stateless function
Right
You can't do that without using structs
would this result in 20: 5 >> 2
Yes
No
5 << 2 would result in 20
I'll be off to Winblows
Yes
5 >> 2 is 5 / pow(2, 2);
Right shift is division
Left shift is multiplication
x << y is (x*y)*y
A shot to the heart, and you're to blame. Now you give love, a bad name!
Nullz, 5 >> 2 is 1(2), 1(10) and 1(16) :D
5 << 2 is 10100(2) and 20(10)
more that half way through C course
Nullz, you can visualize this easily
5(10) is 101(2)
5 << 2 is 101, plus the two new zeros = 10100(2) = 20(10)
It's simple
Splittly I dont undestand binary or hexadecimal or whatever that is
dafuq
Binary is the simplest system to represent numbers
Hexadecimal is...
(Well the simplest would be base 1 but that's useless)
20 in base 1: ....................
Thinking in binary is too hard
20 in base 2: 10100
20 in base 10: 20
And the only statement it has used other than doing stuff with ints and operators(not showing demos, literally just saying what they do in some sort if language i seem to not understand) is printf
TheBrokenKeeper I find thinking in binary easier than thinking in hex
printf is nice
I understand numbers!
Am I the only one that can't calculate in binary in my head?
yes
no, not really
NO
xD
I cant
I can
I can only calculate in base 10, base 12 and base 16
Well maybe your a super human or something
TheBrokenKeeper why would one even consider using base 12
If 20 in base 10 is 20, then I am a pro at base 20
base 2, 8, 10 and 16 make sense.
Nullz, it isn't. :D
Base 12 is one of the most useful bases to use
That's right.
okay guys
The real question here is, whats a base?
You see my current understanding of a base is
Nullz, 20(10) should be 14(16)
How far you gotten with your girl friend
lol
splitty___: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6xJfP7-HCc
Your trying to 20*10 should be 14*16 right?
Not really
Watch the video that TBK just sent :D
TheBrokenKeeper I love how James is always smiling when talking about numbers
Yup
It's one thing to love numbers, but it's a whole different thing to not be scared about showing that you love numbers
Grammar sucks, you get the point
xD
base 12 seems legit
but what about base 64?
LOL
u mad
base 64 is useless.
A subset of base 64 is interesting for encoding characters for transfer over GET parameters.
But no sane person would use base 64 for calculating.
okay so, the numbers like 10100 is base 2 correct?
becuase you only have 0 and 1
would 30 be 10030
Nope.
no
There is only 0 and 1 in decimal
wait
10010
I forgot that
10010 = 30
?
nope
I made progress on understanding atleast
But I can't figure otu a number yet
Hello.
Hello bacon
Nullz, 30 would be 11110
Let's count to 30.
0000
0001
0010
0011
0100
0101
and I'm bored.
0110
0111
1000
1001
1000 - 8
1010
9
10
1011
11
1100
1101
1110
1111
I was joking.
Did I skip many?
xD
I cannot see it.
Yay :D
You skipped almost 30
xD
You skipped half of them. xD
lel
jk
splitty___: Wanna make that console based ChronFile viewer?
ChronoFile*
omfg this C course is so boring
00000, 00001, 00010, 00011, 00100, 00101, 00110, 00111, 01000, 01001, 01010, 01011, 01100, 01101, 01110, 01111, 10000, 10001, 10010, 10011, 10100, 10101, 10110, 10111, 11000, 11001, 11010, 11011, 11100
THere you go
Looks like I skipped one
But anyway
Almost complete
:D
oh I know why
11101, 11110
I skipped two. :D
Well, not skipped. Forgot.
@Nullz 00000, 00001, 00010, 00011, 00100, 00101, 00110, 00111, 01000, 01001, 01010, 01011, 01100, 01101, 01110, 01111, 10000, 10001, 10010, 10011, 10100, 10101, 10110, 10111, 11000, 11001, 11010, 11011, 11100, 11101, 11110
Here, enjoy that wonderful binary sequence from 0 to 30
Atleast I can tell its base 2
C is like the same syntax of C#
course: Goes over base 2 shit, barely does switch statement at the end because its pretty hard
C# is easy :D
Oh
yes
Didn't read it all
Well
yes its easy but not much harder. I think I'll like C++ more though
You'll work with bytes in C, if you want it or not.
C++ sucks. :D
Does C++ have a bool atleast?
Because
C doesn't have a book
bool
but yet, somehow it can do if statements
#define true 1
#define false 0
There
Does C++ have strings?
C has strings too
Well, it has char*
But still
C++ is just bad.
C++ has booleans and strings
But it's a bad language
It looks pretty cool right now actually
Once you start using it, you'll hate it
Alright
Nullz
#define true 1
#define false 0
There you go
splitty___: Look 2 minutes ago at what I said
3*
I mean I like C, I just wish its std was better and was object oriented
lel TheBrokenKeeper didn't see that sorry :D
Nullz, C++ has wchar_t :D
Also, Nullz, if statements are not boolean only
C++ has also std::string
...
also has*
But now, I'll be gaming
I'm gonna go to sleep
Goodnight
Night
.
Hey
Hello, splitty_.
hey splitty_
how's the CSS kernel?
Did not start writing it xD
Cameron: Soo... you play the guitar?
Awesome!
I started learning a couple of months ago, I still suck
Now, I'll be AFK
Well, I discovered the fate of my picks
Yeah although I still suck as well dw, I don't get much time to practice
https://twitter.com/SirBlackhand/status/610895574007615488
I'm here bitches!
Splitty_: I've decided to rewrite my file thing
Turn it into a library
Make it awesome
YOBITCH
A binary version os
Of*
Json or Cson
Cameron, who are you calling a bitch?
yer foken nan m7
YO
BITCH
Also, can I have that twitter link again?
https://twitter.com/SirBlackhand/status/610895574007615488
Thanks
I AM SUCH AN ARSE
ThePhoneKeeper, you've been beaten to binary JSON
WE KNOW
MongoDB made bson ages ago
I LITERALLY PUT THE PICKS IN THE TIN AND RECYCLED IT ON THE SAME FUCKING DAY, LIKE 20 MINUTES LATER
GG
THEN FORGOT ABOUT THEM FOR LIKE 2 WEEKS
GG M9
Luckily Amazon Prime will fix me up by Thursday :D
Aurora01, this will be better
I have a dozen or so picks laying around in my house
I hid one everywhere
Even in my pillows
Picks
Ewww
All the drawers in my house have at least one pick in them
Just awkward
Finger style Augment?
Yus
Classical?
Probably because I started on nylon classical
Yeah
For starters
That's a good idea
Then you'd always know where to find one
I just ordered 12 and they're getting a damn good home
Well, I started on rusty steel acoustic strings... Like literally rusty. My fingers were full of rust after playing
And because of that I ordered an electric guitar
I now have polymer coated stron
Stings*
Strings*
Strings**
Let me get word prediction back
Yeah I went straight to electric
There, better :D
I can see myself being a rhythm guitarist because I wanna shred but I doubt I'd be good enough to do all the riffs and stuff on lead
I'll make the best file format in the world!
With a nice editor
I have a great design in my head
Very modular
As they will be used as an all around file format for everything, from textures to save files, map files and such
It'll have to be as modular as I can make them
And the editor too
I have a basic design in my head, but I need to get it in code form
Augment, will you use them to save data in all of your C# projects?
Nope.
I assure you will after you'll see it's desing
Design*
Most of my projects at the moment either interact with normal formats (e.g. Dement, which fucks with image files) or uses CRAPI for storage
Y u no auto correct you piece of shit
The HTC One M9 is a great phone, but it sometimes pisses me off
Probably because you haven't got it set to autocorrect?
I have
It works when it wants to
Afk
Back
Cameron, do you program?
Aye, not a huge amount but I do a fair bit of JavaScript, PHP and C#
aka no
Interesting
I build/maintain some software at work for our research and meetings and stuff
aka no
real programmers don't exist.
Bacon, will you use my file format when it will be released?
they're just shells for b acon
Sure, in 100 years.
It'll be awesome!
It uses Amazon/eBay/Google APIs and has some of its own lil' frameworks and stuff to manage users, generate agendas for meetings, etc
Now, ask again
Afk
APIs are sooooooo 2014, I now run a cable to Google.
well...
it's a wire
and two foam cups
and I get no response.
..
...
Night, people.
Tired.
Night
PHP
DIE
!!!!!
Well, got to go now.
Bye
NIGHT BACON
Looks like it's just us guys now AH AH AH AH AH
....
heeeeeeelp~
Augment. I'll help you
Just give me 1000 doge coins and you'll get help
And he doesn't ask what with. Poor, misguided person
Well, 1000 dogecoins
is like
12 pence
lol
ThePhoneKeeper officially world's cheapest hooker
I'm not a hookah, I'm a good citizen
Well, you just offered to 'help' me for a fee :v
Soyeahhhhh
Would you want some help with hiding a body? Siri can help you
Augment, do you know how to piano?
Nope
Piano roll FTW
in face
*fact
Working in audio ftw
...
I mean, my Masada remix is more or less entirely sample manipulation
You are the cheapest person in the world for that
Why?
Piano roll is plague. The only true way is to record midi
Ah, but it's so much quicker
And easier
Particularly given my workflow, which generally involves bouncing to samples early
It's not...
and just using the piano roll for pitch bends for the source sound
(melody? Who needs it? :P)
6smexy9him
ikr
I'm back
Hi TTK
If anyone uses Sublime Text 3 and is a fan of material design... http://equinusocio.github.io/material-theme/
This looks amazing
And it seems to be inspired from Solarized
As I was saying, TheBrokenKeeper, my workflow really isn't MIDI-based enough to need to worry about how I input MIDI data.
https://www.dropbox.com/s/iu565k9654grrri/Screenshot%202015-05-05%2007.40.39.png?dl=0
4 midi tracks.
In this entire project.
Cameron: http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized
3 of which are subs, one of which is a pad layer.
Solarized isn't bad but nothing on that material one :3
I don't get how people use FL Studio
Easily enough
It has a sane UI, unlike, say, Ableton
I mean...
Pro Tools?
Patcher's interface for routing, compared to Ableton instrument racks. Patcher hands down.
Easily crackable?
CuBase?
Interesting
Easily crackable, frankly, is an upside for someone with no cash like me.
I'm talking about Pro Tools
Cameron, I've seen this theme on dribbble a few months ago :D
Cubase, I've used one or twice. Cluttered and unwieldy.
ProTools and Cubase are a bitch to crack
I hate Cubase XD
Definitely Dribbble-worthy, splitty_
yeah :D
Never touched protools, but it doesn't seem capable of a lot of thigns FL is
No ProTools is solid as fuck
See-also: Routing formulae
It's just hard to get working, let alone crack
See-also: No patcher equivalent
They have really weird hardware requirements
See-Also: More awkward workflow for resampling
FL Studio is good if you can figure out how to use it for more than just basic sequencing, the functionality is there, just a bit hidden
Again, SONAR is pretty good, I think it's on Steam now as well
SONAR, the new versions suck
The version made in 2006 was the best one
Cameron: The functionality's not hidden at all
FL just stays the hell out of the way, and that's how things should be
I mean compared to all the standard sequencing stuff
Took me a while to realise you could double-click a note to see its specific options
Seriously?
Or figure out how to pitch bend
Yeah I didn't follow a tutorial that's not how I roll
Nor did I
Hence my projects always end up being a clusterfuck of sampling
and filter automation and other such good times
Haha
I tend to use instruments where I can and the best VSTs I can find otherwise
For example, Addictive Drums for drums... Ace VST
And their website is hella sexy http://www.xlnaudio.com/addictivedrums
True, but who needs accoustic drums
Everyone...
When you can just sequence a bunch of real nice once from, say, NHF
As flat audio, in the playlist
like a man
(NHF sample pack drums = <3)
THIS IS BADASS: http://9gag.tv/p/aVY6N3/microsoft-hololens-minecraft-e3-2015-minecraft-holographic-demo?ref=fbl9
ok
Night ladies xo
Night bitches.
So yeah, night all
Hi!
Hi splitty__
Hey Aviv
hiiii
CSS Kernel?
CSS is the best
bits-32 {
global: start;
}
start {
Hmm
That didn't work well
https://gist.github.com/Tel-Aviv/1473a7f130a3cd8ef914
That's better
Aviv, I'd prefer LESS-Style
lol LESS looks like CSSa
Are you thinking of SASS?
Dont you love it when your power turns off for 30 mins
^
Aviv I'm working on the LESS thing :D
woo
It'll be weird as fuck, but awesome
Ok
But why LESS?
Because it allows variable declaration
lol ok
Like #define
In Assembly code
I do love it Nullz
Aviv: https://gist.github.com/SplittyDev/4338030e7fbd8b9f3ac2
lol that's amazing splitty__
I used to think C/C++ is hard
CSS is even harder
xDD
Viperidae, we're writing a kernel in CSS/LESS
But then I actually played with C and it isnt that hard. I then saw whatever that is and I dont understand one line on it xD
It's simple CSS. Kernelized CSS: :D
WOO
Kernelized.CSS
splitty_: wut
Aviv: Updated it
https://gist.github.com/SplittyDev/4338030e7fbd8b9f3ac2
It's now 100% LESS compatible
Viperidae, Aviv came up with the weird idea of writing a kernel in CSS
The original is on my github
Great! Now someone just write a CSS assembly preprocessor
That's what I'll do :P
https://github.com/Tel-Aviv/CSS-Kernel
Aviv's original version is just some stuff that will never work
But my gist could actually work
yeah
Hahaha
Apparently.
CSS is turing complete
xDD
Woo!
now all you antiwebdev people can learn CSS!
Kind of...
But... I could just use nasm
lolno
I'll ask Richard Stallman if he wants to write GNU CSSAS
ok
jk
I'll do it.
lol http://forum.nasm.us/ needs descant badly
ascss or cssas (name not decided yet) will be the css to assembly compiler
Write a kernel with a built in VBA interpreter
OMG YES!
That would be so good
ccss will be the ccss to c compiler.
Or I'll fork GCC and rename it to GCCSS
xDD
C to css.. How the hell would that even work xD
I mean
and then make a XML to assembly preprocessor!!!
css to C
Viperidae, no idea. I'll come up with something
So then PPT can make an OS
Nah Aviv, I'll write an PPTX to C converter
jk, of course
nope
you can't take that back
you're doing it!
I'm splitty, I can take anything back
:P
^
Bitmap to C++
programming with pixels
any comments on thaT?
Uhm, I've seen people write programs in paint xD
Nullz: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYLm8uclr0I (This wasn't what I was looking for though)
No like
Seriously make a interpreter that instead of loads string it loads a bitmap
That wasn't the video I was talking about, I saw someone make a Hello World COM file in paint or something
Nullz I am pretty sure that there is an esoteric language out there that works with bitmaps
https://gist.github.com/SplittyDev/4338030e7fbd8b9f3ac2
Viperidae, does this look legit? :P
I am pretty sure that I can turn this 100% valid LESS code into 100% valid AT&T assembly
Hahahah, yeah I don't know about the CSS part; but it looks legit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtQdIYUtAHg
AT&T assembly
woo AT&T
best company ever!
thank god there isnt a microsoft service provider..
Google Fibre is the future, I wish my city had Google Fibre
Comcast will be rolling out 1gb in my area
this year
I'll be able to host servers once I finish my computer if I can figure out how to protect my self from DDoS D:
:D*
I really hope Microsoft becomes a service provider
BUT NULLZ
why host at home when we have Microsoft Azure?
Eww
I wonder what SHA1 sounds like
Its not free/already paid for
30 day trial at least ;)
http://wurstcaptures.untergrund.net/music/
nope
That moment when it feels like it works but you dont know for sure.
just use windows kk?
Windows needs to die
I really hopes Micro$haft fucks up with Windows 10
oh shit
I just realized my new computer wont be able to support linux
lol they won't Viperidae
you're just jelly because NT is better than infinity
But...
Infinity is not linux
Nullz: Why? What the hell kind of computer are you buying?
t * ((t>>16|t>>9)&666&t>>6)
The motherboard doesnt have linux drivers
yay
What the hell kind of motherboard is that. This is why proprietary drivers MUST DIE.
Dont worry viper
I'll still get the linux
On this computer + teamviewer + ipad
I'm just saying, it's fucked up that proprietary drivers exist
lol
Not really

Yes it is Aviv..
Proprietary software is evil
#WhatWouldStallmanDo
yeah i completely agree with viper on proprietary DRIVERS
(not the software part)
Enlighten yourselves: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn8gealMDsg
My users do not have freedom. They are now my little slaves. I control them now.
There parents mean nothing to hem for I am there REAL parents now.
:|
Throught out my efforts of looking for a funny I control you now! video I have found some people actually believe mind control is possible. lewl
Wow
Nullz I did something weird :D
Wow
Nullz, Viperidae, Aviv

xDDDD
I would love to do that but the algorithm to do that is probably really complicated. :D
Aviv: because of you everyone is moving on, good job.
Huh?
hmm?
Hey slackroad
heu
jeu
FU
hey*
splitty__:
why two underscores now?
Each underscore makes me twice as awesome
*world explodes*
but I live
Hey look! slackroad is now a method in python!
xDD
Good one
xDDDD
Yay slackroad method!
Aviv I wonder if you'd manage to write a working Hello, World! kernel if I'd provide you with the tools
Maybe.
LOL
ALLAHU AKBAR!
You'd need to write the asm stub and a basic terminal that writes to 0xB8000;
IDEK what any of those mean
How about if it is a CSS kernel?
It's useless to write a css to asm/c compiler if nobody uses it.. lel
lel
Not really splitty__!
It's for the fun of programming as Viperidae calls it
I'd rather write my kernel in VB6 than in CSS
^
whaaaa
Why not write a kernel in PHP?
There is just so much useless wrapping going on to make it CSS compatible
mov { a: ref(address(eval(0x31))); b: register(eax); }
vs mov $0x31 %eax
:(
https://youtu.be/LrH1Y7Jf59E?t=195
How about you do it for JacoScript then?
Or Iodine?
JacoScript is the best
Hell, splitty__
you're wasting your time,
you should work on Tel
instead of this
Tel is the platform of the future
Forget twitter
Tel is what's new!
Tel is like Twitter with SQL injection, isn't that good?
I think TTK would like it
^
We should take over Tel while Reagan is away
Want to?
Join #tel, then!
Nah
It's too easy
I need something challenging. Hacking tel is not something I'm interested in ^^
I did it before and I could do it again. But.. meh
wow.
That disconnect.
Well..
I've been tasked with protecting Reagan's assets while he is gone
What is the last thing I said that got sent?
lol Viperidae :D
21:53 <splitty__> I did it before and I could do it again. But.. meh
ah okay good
So
I called Courtney a stupid whore
lol
Why?
I don't know if she heard me though xD I think she did, Castiel and I drove by her (She was walking away from school with some guys) and I asked him to roll down his window, then I was like You're a stupid whore! or something; then Castiel speed off.
:D
In that case I will have a look at tel
Good job viperidae :D
Wow that was mean
So let's look for issues in TelBoard!
Doesn't look like there's much wrong with auth.php :(
That isnt mean aviv
It's a mean thing to say
If you knew what she did to viper you'd think different
Yeah ^
https://github.com/JacobMisirian/TelBoard/blob/master/TelBoard/board.php#L60 lol what is he doing here?
He's making a brand new MySQL connection just to get replies...
Aviv, hint: There is no sql injection vulnerability
(At least none that I know of)
yeah me too
You should focus on cross scripting
But another connection for another MySQL query is just like why
^^
and why does he rename $query to $rquery???
He is learning.
But that should be obvious?
And I have absolutely no idea.
xD
Well
Hm
I think I see something a little SQL inject-y
I will further investigate
I can understand his PHP code more than his C# code
No, but what he's doing is still bad practice
Silly Jacob, Tel is for kids!
Yeah its a like a 4chan
lol this is great here: https://github.com/JacobMisirian/TelBoard/blob/master/TelBoard/do-login.php#L27
He's going through EVERY user to find a match for a username
Hasn't he heard of MySQL's WHERE function?
Apparently the answer is yes because he uses elsewhere
so this is just really bad coding
IDIOT
It doesn't make anyone an idiot, Viperidae!
Just more encouragement
Can you do that Viperidae?
I've found the first thing about windows
Read how to SQL, yes
I can do that xD
Why does he literally comment every line
//Start the session
session_start();
/Start the session
No shit
You should tell him this stuff
I did
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzt6qz1YzrI
lel
He never listens to me though, and if I talk about anything he doesn't know he gets scared over it.
Damn, Reagan isn't here to start an int0x10 religious fight
lol
Can I take his place?
No
Darn
Aviv, what are you religious believs? :D
lol I comment almost literally every line too, Viperidae
I believe that believs is not a word
But other than that
oops
xDD
beliefs*
Let's see now, what are they...
http://pastebin.com/ih85yM6q hows this viper?
Not bad, I'd personally though use if/else instead of that one switch (The switch is kind of silly on a boolean)
if(YIncentments) {
} else {
}
ah true
xD didnt think of that, thanks. Anything else?
Hmmm, not too much else, it looks good but I'm no gamedev
Also
I'm writing fizz buzz in assembly because of Aviv
You're welcome
if ($message ==  || $message ==   || $name ==  || $name ==  )
I guess Tel lets you have messages with multiple spaces?
splitty___!!!
Good news!!!
Tel does support SQL injection!
Damn
I just ate 11 pieces of toast
7 of them with meat salad
2 of them with jam
And 2 of them with honey
#rekt
Hey splitty___
Hey.
You found a SQL injection? :D
Oh yes
It's a very good one
Where?
I've wrote fizz buzz before but i forget what it was
Yay Aviv I'm almost done
yay
for(var i=1;i<=100;i++){Console.Write({0}\n,i%3?fizz:i%5?buzz:i);}
Here. My implementation in C# :D
You have to ask the user for input though xD
lol why?
The user is supposed to answer whether or not i is fizz, buzz, or fizz buzz
ooh
I looked it up on wikipedia.
Fizz buzz has been used as an interview screening device for computer programmers.[2][3] Creating a list of the first 100 Fizz buzz numbers is a trivial problem for any would-be computer programmer, so interviewers can easily sort out those with insufficient programming ability.
There is a really bad example implementation in js, which just prints out the number, fizz or buzz.
splitty___ https://github.com/JacobMisirian/TelBoard/blob/master/TelBoard/do-reply.php
Ah, ok. I was reading the first section that just said
Players generally sit in a circle. The player designated to go first says the number 1, and each player thenceforth counts one number in turn. However, any number divisible by three is replaced by the word fizz and any divisible by five by the word buzz. Numbers divisible by both become fizz buzz. A player who hesitates or makes a mistake is eliminated from the game.
In a for loop.
For example, a typical round of fizz buzz would start as follows:
Wow
Well then
I guess this interactive fuzz buzz was a waste of time xD
xD
Yeah
lol
Sorry :P
Can anyone beat my one-liner? :D

Better than what I could've done!
Did you see the SQLinjection splitty___?
I'm taking a look at it now
$mstmt = $conn->prepare('UPDATE messages SET replied=true WHERE id=' . $_GET['id']);
bad bad bad
FOOLD
Also why is he using oop here and every where else not oop?
Jacob barely knows how to OOP
Even in C#
LOL
But
It's
not
hard?
Well, he knows how to. He doesn't know when too, he says he doesn't see a need for it
lol
Doesn't see a need for it.
Nice
$mstmt = $conn->prepare('UPDATE messages SET replied=true WHERE id=' . $_GET['id']);
WHY IS HE DOING THAT
HE IS CORRECTLY BINDING THE VALUES JUST A FEW LINES ABOVE
Link to the code?
I think you can just do id=1 AND 1=2 to see if it is vulnerable
https://github.com/JacobMisirian/TelBoard/blob/master/TelBoard/do-reply.php
He has two tables, right?
So.. id=1 AND 1=2 UNION SELECT 1,column_name FROM information_schema.columns LIMIT 1,1--
Is replied a string value?
If so he should be using a tinyint with 1 and 0...
Obviously yes
lol
Aviv, tinyint(1) is deprecated
Know your SQL!
Not to my knowledge
He uses strings for bools
true
wut
Aviv, BIT(1) is the new hotness
It doesn't look like it on the MySQL manual
but yeah fine splitty___
I use tinyint, but...
yeah lol
There's nothing wrong with using tinyint(1)
I'll use bit from now on
But I am pretty sure that BIT(1) is the preferred way to do it
well
if you want more then 0 or 1
then use tinyint
OMG OMG OMG OH NO
than**********8
not then
than is for comparisons!!!!
$rquery = 'SELECT nickname, message FROM replies WHERE id=' . $id;
another one...
lol
The one with $_GET is the best though
Oh this one uses that too
oh haha
so splitty___, what are you going to do with this?
Wait..
Nevermind
Poor raerae
I wonder what he'll end up doing
$query = 'SELECT username FROM users WHERE username=' . $_GET['user'] . '';This one
Maybe he'll get a job in TTK's palace
1'); DROP TABLE users;
xDD
It's hard to get any useful information from tel..
that do-reply-php is reloading too fast
[20:27] <Viperidae> He uses strings for bools [20:28] <Viperidae> true [20:28] <Viperidae> wut >> are you serious ?
yep
https://github.com/JacobMisirian/TelBoard/blob/master/TelBoard/do-reply.php
Line 31
woo!
... why, is there like no bool in php?
there is
lol
There is no bool in mysql.
but that doesn't mean use a string...
And he doesn't seem to know that booleans are just integers.
^
Aviv, you could restructure his database to use BIT(1) LOL
I'd rather not help RaeRae
But yeah I could
like really sadly I could...
xD
I'll listen to some great german rap now, while writing the ascss compiler.
Because I'm bored. xD
lol
such as money boy?
Not really xD

That CSS kernel thing is just weird :D
I want to create subdomain but I dont know how to in wordpress
ignore ^
lel
Nullz: https://gist.github.com/SplittyDev/4338030e7fbd8b9f3ac2
Updated it. This is a kernel loader, written in valid CSS. xD
NIce
So my area has GIGABIT INTERNET now(comcast, I was talking about it earlier figured out its already here)
>> Can't get it
>> To expensive
lel
hi bacon Emily Nullz splitty___
Hello
Hey
Ichiru, I'm doing something crazy
https://gist.github.com/SplittyDev/4338030e7fbd8b9f3ac2
splitty
css isn't turing complete
Viperidae said that CSS is turing complete
lel
it isn't though
Hmm. I doesn't really matter. llcss-as creates AT&T or NASM x86 code (can be set by --style=att or --style=nasm) from the css.
That code gets assembled by gnu-as or nasm
that's weird
Aviv had that crazy idea of writing a kernel in css and I think it's a funny idea
I will be the first person on this planet to write a working Hello, World! kernel in valid CSS
valid as in only uses valid css syntax, not as in passes the jigsaw validator :D
It would probably work to just replace syntax elements using regex
But I'm gonna write a scanner and parser
you're strange
I know, right
:P
Hey ThePhoneKeeper
I'm reading logs, afk
k
Have fun
Yesturday I learned C now I'm learning C++
Well not really learned I pretty much just understand it now xD
Gonna be afk for awhile
Sup bitches?
I'm sorry. You're not all bitches
Only a few, won't name any
lol
Nullz: That switch statement is not healthy
It's fixed :D
Good.
Ichiru, are you here/
?*
So um in C++
#include <iostream> using namespace std; whats the difference? Is the using namespace doing C++ things and hte include doing C libraries?
Nullz: Nope
Btw, don't do the using namespace thing. It's bad practicwe
practice*
Whenever you do something like cout, right? That's coming from iostream, a C library and it's in the std namespace. Normally, you call it as std::cout, but because you have that using namespace std, you don't have to put the std namespace before
But it's still a bad practice to do using namespace things
I dont understand how thats bad practice xD
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1452721/why-is-using-namespace-std-considered-bad-practice
ah alright
I managed to update my font renderer
To work properly
Ichiru: Awesome
I want to rewrite my file format
Make it way better
And modular
I like C++ so far and I can already do what that C course teached me in C++
Pretty much the same thing but the C++ course went over it already
Only thing I dont understand is what do I gotta use << in printing to the console?
Nullz, you can also use printf
Oh lol thanks
You can use everything from C
Nullz: cout and cin are from iostream, printf and such are from stdio
I didn't include stdio though?
And it works?
.
NickServ<	identify ****
yep
These are my includes: #include <iostream> #include <cassert> #include foo.h;
#include <cstdio>
if you want to use printf
#include <iostream> is std::cout
It already works
if you want to use newer C++ features
It'll get stricter
and force you to include it :P
I'm using printf without stdio xD
Visual studio might automatically include it
Ichiru, splitty_: Is MD5 good for a file checksum?
ye
for file verification
Good
Is it weird if I include the checksum at the beginning of the file?
Checksum for the content
nah
that's pretty usual
I also totally forgot to enable blending, and wondered why my transparent things weren't working __-
I can't remember which blendfunc i'm supposed to use
I'll tell you in a bit
figured it out from the docs
Good
So in total
My GL wrapper is 237 lines including debug code
Awesome.
turns out you can add hooks to any delegate
I can't inherit IDisposable and EventArgs :/
Am I the only one who doesn't have anything that implements IDispozable?
disposabe*
disposable*
fuc
fuck*
I HATE THIS!
I need to play something
Maybe. I think its important for optimization,.
Turns out I dont even need it on this class because it only has ints and you can't null ints!
you only need to dispose things
that need disposing
like file handles
and graphics resources
Or smelly vaginas
cuz they think af
hence the word smelly
they think af
I'm done the night, gnight
I'm gonna go to sleep
Goodnight :P

It's true
Directly send sql injects to each other1
Whats better thna that!
Right
TelBoard will beat Descant

Tel is the best messagin' app thing ever!
I get it now

Not a unicorn always
Lol its to celebrate it.
I still can't get over how this guy can't pronounce GtD
lol how about celebrating Base64 encoding?
https://youtu.be/vt_7DiG1-r8?t=47 :/
base 64 is a number system though...
If it would celebrate a number system they would do Base 10 > Base 64 anyways
base 16 all the way....
I only know how to read base 10
Which everyone knows how to xD
I can read base 16 easily, and binary too (Although I'd have to think it through in my head alot more)
I'm liking C++ :D
good

Did Aerg say anything?
No
I meant the mod reviewer of your halo mod

Ohhh, lol ok; Ha I thought you were talking about our mystery man
lol
You should upload a new video
of your iodine progress
hey y'all
I haven't progressed too much, I've been meaning to make a commit but I've been wasting all my time today with Minecraft
Wait you play minecraft?

Poor Ichiru
Like do yo uactualy play play minecraft or just make mods
Hey TheBrokenKeeper
PEOPLE!!!
There are a lot of people here
Awesome!!!
It's 5 AM and I think I'm done with the sleeping, don't ask me why...
why
I simply cannot sleep anymore
hi
Hello
I made some awesome asian noodles
nope
They are fucking hot.
Too much chili
Nullz: I occasionally play single player, but when I do I usually get into it
What game?
Minecraft
For some reason I'm very sick of that game
I haven't opened it in a good while
That's why I only play it like once or twice a year
Yup
I had 4 years of playing it daily, then I simply got sick of being bored in a world of cubes
I used to do like team death match and stuff in it, but that's broken atm and I need my aussie buddies
For some reason, because I now know how neural networks work, I want to make one in C#
But I'm also forced to make a website for my school class
And work on my game engine
I'm basically fucked
I don't feel like doing anything
back
do the website first
websites for schools have shockingly low requirements
Why are you forced to make a website for school?
I don't work for free
You shouldn't either
Viperidae: If I don't write it, I won't pass a class
So yeah
That doesn't make any sense...
You're not in a webdevelopment class
Ask my head teacher
She's the bitch
How can she give you an entirely different assignment than the rest of the class?
Because the rest of the class doesn't have any
And I'm not doing the normal classes while I'm home schooled
I do a reduced set of things

+TheMagesticWaffle1 Come back to me when you hit Assembly and C to program Microcontrollers - No Alduino and no scripts.
That said, there are tools nowadays that help programmers and designers alike. For games, you have engines such as Unity and even Unreal Engine 4 - free now and... oh so nice. PHP is easier than HTML, and you are able to use a MySQL database instead of forcing yourself on asp.net. There are a variety of IDEs and engines that makes things you had to do before, look ridiculously easy. An example is C++ and C# (or java), with its nightmarish
pointers vs C#'s ArrayList.
Nullz, did my thing go through?
Or did the flood trigger kill me before?
yah
it went through
The _TheMagesticwaffle1?
Who cares about the name
Now, you see how much wrong there is in that comment?
pointers vs C#'s ArrayList. is the last thin you said
and it actually did kick you at that point sorry
And so much more... Easy to use engines: Construct2, Stencil, Kodu. Etc etc etc...
The generation before us wasn't that lucky, programming on IDEs that looked closer to Notepad... or were Notepad... And yet, they are the ones responsible for the awesome tools we can enjoy today
That's the rest
I dont see where its wrong?
Everywhere
Hes pretty much just pointing out that i'ts easier now then it was then
First of all, you can use C to program the Arduino
And there's no such thing asn an Alduino
>> Dont even know what arduino is
A little board you program, it has input and output pins so you can connect LEDs, motors and such
PHP is easier than HTML, and you are able to use a MySQL database instead of forcing yourself on asp.net.
This
PHP is never easier than HTML
Nor do you have to force yourself to use ASP.NET if you don't want PHP
There are other alternatives, Ruby, Python, a static page, so on and so forth
Also, PHP is not MySQL only. It can work with any database if you know how to set it up
Also, there was no generation to program in notepad. Ever.
There were IDEs even since the first c64
And Atari computers
Alright so everywhere he was wrong, are things I havent touched or learned anything about xD
Okay, nor IDEs
Code editors
Tools to make your life easier when you program
Woo
Woo what?
Woo tools that make your life easier when you program
TheBrokenKeeper: I wouldn't call Kodu an engine
Neither would I
But as you can see, that guy's an idiot
Thinking he's the best on the planet
LOL kodu is like a sandbox for children.
Oh wait
He said that
Yes
Not me
Is this on a Youtube video?
Yup
Link?
Trying to get to it. Shitty internet is shitty
Viperidae: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44
I'm sure your internet is 1000x better than anything anyone else here has...
The shitstorm troopers have arrived.
100-125mbps down 12 up. Wbu you ttk?
lol it looks like some bad version of scratch
Nullz: Way less
Because I'm on Wifi
Holy shit Nullz that's fast as shit
On wired, my shitty laptop limits my speed to 150 down, 130 up
But on my PC I usually have 500 down 150 up
TheBrokenKeeper: That is fast as fuck
I'm on wired
I'm sorry, but if you think 150 mbps is slow you are a spoiled fucking panzy
^
The majority of the fucking world has somewhere around 30 mbps
I currently have 43...
That's two times faster than my speed
10 times faster than Augments
Nullz: http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/4440832995
PS TheBrokenKeeper: I gave up on downloading Korora
When not on wired its like 50-80 depending on the device(other than the expection of my phone and only my phone with 20) and every device gets 11-12 up
Because internet speeds
Great
That's shitty G wireless
As my laptop doesn't know N wireless
Shitty?
Yes
Dual shitty core with 3GB of RAM
I call that shitty
Don't you?
I have like 25 Mbps
There is NOTHING more irritating than hearing someone complain about 40 MBPS.
Viperidae, can you fucking stop the abuse?
I used to only get 0.5mpbs for a whole fucking year
There are so many people I know who'd appreciate 40 MBPS
I was talking about this
06:17 <Viperidae> Shitty?
06:18 <TheBrokenKeeper> Yes
06:18 <TheBrokenKeeper> Dual shitty core with 3GB of RAM
06:18 <TheBrokenKeeper> I call that shitty
Lol
Viperidae, I was talking about my specs
Not speed
For fuck sake STOP THE KILL ABUSE
I don't kill you because I don't have a reason, nor should you kill me for no reason
Okay?
You were talking about your wifi standards (You said it doesn't support 802.11g)
That was channel flood
I said it supports G
But not N
And I consider that to be a shitty laptop
As even my fucking 2008 phone knows N wifi connection
There are people in Africa who would love to have that laptop
Oh for fuck sake cut the crap
I would love to have that laptop for linux
6
*^
Think about all the poor children in need
I really want to kill you now, but I have some respect
http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/4440840964 A little bit slower than USUAL but there you go
Viperidae: By your own laws, shouldn't you kill Nullz?
As you said that speeds over 40 MB are forbidden
A long time ago
Uhm, no
But rules still apply, right?
I'm not complaining
What I said was complaining about speeds over 40 MB was forbidden xD
I was complaining about my laptop specs not my fucking internet speed
I'm saying its slower than usual :p
You don't know how to pay attention at what you read Viperidae
And I said that because it's annoying as fuck to see people complain about such high speeds, when half the world doesn't have speeds that fast
I WAS FUCKING COMPLAINING ABOUT LAPTOP SPECS
4 years ago I would of loved to have your laptop
I got it in 2010
It was a completely reasonable assumption that you were implying that your speed is reduced because it does not support the latest wifi standards.
Well, yes, it is
But you seem to be in a pissy mood today....
It's 6:25 AM
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzpndHtdl9A
I've been up since 4:30
In Mother Russia, you make words, not words make you.
Btw, I intended bad grammar, from now on I will specify everything. I don't want a kill again
I remember when 10mbps were godly << inb4 you guys are like back in 90's we had kb internet
What happens when your killed
I get disconnected
./kill nullz
I had dial-up internet when I was small
That doesn't work
./destroy nullz
Would you like me to kill you?
yes
oh
How was it?
weird
It went to the status screen
and was like
TheBrokenKeeper are you interested in a CLion keygen?
spdoiugwergkxcljgnhpjdsilgnsfknasdmf you got killed oa;phgfnjkahfusaifjalkf int0x10 base 2 100101010101
splitty__: I already have one
lol where did you get it from?
See TheBrokenKeeper: You can kill people who are lesser than you too.
And you also need to patch CLion to be able to generate a key
Viperidae, I can kill you too...
Yeah but patching it is easy
Yeah, but I can nullroute you; so I'm still on top
I can also nullroute you too
I just have to wait a few hours
No you can't xD
Aurora can
splitty__: https://github.com/rover12421/JetbrainsPatchKeygen
Oh yeah, he has root access
See?
I can tell him how you were bad and mean to all of us
Give him some fake logs
But he does not have solusVM access.
Well
Or VNC access
Don't know then
When Reagan comes back I'll be able to do it
lol, Reagan doesn't have root
I know
But he can give you a program
I write a rootkit
Get access to your whole PC
You know, things like that?
But...
I have root access to the Vulcan botnet
DDoS time
I know... And it's scary
Ha, he only has like 7 people infected I think though
Poor him XD
Infect the world!
That's enough to down a MyBB forum!
Awesome!
I had a dream last night where I fucked my friends mom
That... doesn't really sound healthy
Mums are not thigns to fuck with
Viperidae, TheBrokenKeeper
shes hot and single though
I wonder if it would be illegal to put my MBAM keygen on github
I had a dream where I fucked a furry
Don't know splitty
Nullz: Does she have a facebook profile?
Technically it's just a algorithm that creates keys.
I'll get a picture
XD
The use should be illegal, but just open sourcing it should not.
Theres one and she doesnt look hot in it <<
I had a dream I got raped by a dog
Interesting.
Rowan and Sabrina were also there, but there in all of my dreams
Am I the only person with realistic goals?
Like... Viperidae's bestiality and Nullz's stars... Those are kinda hard goals
what?
Nullz: You have a crush on stars
Yes but I know it'll never happen
I have a crush on a slut, still :(
Interesting
I'll be sleeping now
Night viper
And I also have a crush on Taylor swift, Debby Ryan, and Peyton List
One day they'll all take turns sucking my dick
Good night [Idle]Viperae

Hello people of this chat.
Hello bacon of this chat.
I want a subway sandwich so bad right now
The closest subway to me is 120 km away from me
I know know how big km is :/
A mile is 1.6 km
One sec
no thanks
I got it
74.56 miles
105
nvm
lol I typed in 170 not 120
Interesting
Thats a while an I feel bad for you
Mine is 1.5 miles xD
Cool
Mine is I don't know miles.
I just checked
0.559 miles and
another at 0.497 miles
I don't get why America uses miles, why don't all countries use the metric system
And celsius instead of farenheit
Indeed, km is better.
A meter is just more logical
0.8km and 0.9km
There's no point getting into a war of measurement systems though, there's nothing we can do.
or is there...
We can kill everyone not using the metric system!
This day marks the beginning of a segregation between the imperialists and the metrics.
The revolution begins now.
ON MY MARKS
READY>
FIRE.
I'd kill two people, but they'll hate me afterwards
XD
TheBrokenKeeper
Did you read my pm?
Yes
k
I'm too lazy to check it out right now
k
It works pretty well
Nice
Here is a screenshot of my event log:
http://puu.sh/itmbU/b102a8fa46.png
http://puu.sh/itmcp/d8cb0fd6b5.png
I wish I was taught the metric system. I also wish the USA wasn't a pile of dog shit too. All things I can't change though. I'll probably be marked as a terrorist in the NSA just for saying this too.
Nullz: The NSA can't see this IRC server
Well yes maybe not  but who can say there isn't a keylogger planted into my harddrive
Or when I plugged one of my usbs in it infected it
Keyloggers are not planted by the NSA
You sure? :D
Okay, the point I'm trying to make is there is much more ways that just grabbing the information from the IRC
Okay
The NSA can probably read everything here.
Are they connected?
They don't need to be connected
If not, this IRC is mostly using SSL
Do you really think that SSL is a problem for the NSA?
No
But they don't bother with small IRC networks
How do you know this?
Theres no way to know for sure.
Well fuck the NSA
Yes fuck the NSA but I can't do anything about it
Hey, NSA, if you see this, you can go fuck yourself. Get each and every one of the employees and give each one of them buttplugs to insert. Also, gangbang eachother. So yeah, the NSA can go die in a pit.
Education here sucks, People here suck, The decisions here suck etc etc etc. NSA if your reading this I'm not a terrorist and I never want to harm the NSA, I just dont agree with almost anything the USA does with education and freedom
NSA if you read this, I am a terrorist and I want to harm the NSA because #freedom
Guns don't kill people. Splitty does.
Too much?
No? Good.
I wonder if feminists averagely believe in god because if so we could use it as a argument.
For what?
Well most modern day feminists say all men are bad, but if they believe in god, we could use jesus as the argument.
anyways going to sleep, night.
That's more misandry than feminism
Just sayin
There grouped more nicks
Soo... What's the topic of the current discussion?
Whatever, I like true feminism but most pop culture feminists are like that. Feel free to prove me wrong tomorrow but thats what my research about this whole movement for the past 2 days have been like. night
Augment, do you webdev?
AndroUser2, do you webdev?
You know, androirc users should set fallback nicks
Splitty__, you here?
Yes
Your Descant theme lacks shadows
whut
Material design has soft shadows sometimes
There are shadows everywhere. :D
I can't see any

Are you sure that you are talking about my theme? :D
Okay...
http://descant.splitty.de/index.html#/topics
That
I am still working on it. I need to figure out something nice for the topic list
And some stuff isn't working as it should
Ah, okay
It will probably be in descant v0.2 or descant v0.3
Am I the only person who can't do web design?
It'll take a few weeks to finish it.
I am not good at web design.
I am just doing it because I want a simple flat/material design. :D
I currently have 3 different people making a website each for my class
Nikxda, Aurora and Aviv
loool
Which means that 2/3 of the total work on that website is completely redundant
I'll chose the best one :D
Yup
Did you tell them that other people are working on the same thing?
I'm working on one too
Yup
k
Everybody but him is working on his site. Mkay.
^^
[13:48] (ThePhoneKeeper) I'm working on one too
I am pretty sure that Nikxda will make the best one
He's a really experienced web designer
I'll let the head teacher decide which one to use in the end. Hopefully nikxda does the best job
We are working perfectly together. I do the backend programming, he does the frontend stuff. :D
Nice
Did any of you buy obsidian.ninja?
Yes
And we bought https://obsidians.io
Which one did it?
We're still working on the public API.
did what?
Whick one of you bought it?
Nikxda bought them using my credentials :D
Nikxda says he doesn't have .ninja in his namecheap list
Afk
oh. Maybe he didn't buy .ninja. I'm not completely sure if he did.
Back
.ninja domains seem to be $15 US a year
Splitty__, timestud.io is $33
Wow...

I'm still wondering if it's possible for one to become fluent in Japanese via self teaching
I'm getting messages from bots at least once a month
And no, it isn't.
At least understand a bit?
I tried it. xD
Did you manage to get anywhere with it?
Well, just the basic stuff.
Define basic stuff
Japanese is not hard. You can learn the words and the pronounciation. The problem is that you can't teach yourself the syntax and stuff like that.
Well I can thank people for food and I can order beer.
And ask them for their names and stuff
Really basic
Interesting
Also, Katakana and Hiragana is confusing. xD
Also, is it possible for one to write japanese with Windows? Like Hiragana Katakana and Kanji combined?
Because afaik, you can only cohose one of them
You'd write Romanji
You have to be crazy for that
Romaji*
Like, really
Not really
No sane person uses Romaji for japanese
Katakana is mostly used for loan words, but you can use it for other purposes
Hiragana is for japanese words when they're not written in kanji
And Hiragana is also used for the syntax. Stuff like conjugations
Katakana and Hiragana == Kana
ÔøΩÔøΩ?ÔøΩ?ÔøΩÔøΩ?ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ?ÔøΩ?ÔøΩÔøΩ?ÔøΩÔøΩ?ÔøΩÔøΩ?ÔøΩÔøΩ?ÔøΩ„ÇìÔøΩ?ÔøΩ„ÇåÔøΩ?ÔøΩÔøΩ?ÔøΩÔøΩ?ÔøΩ„ÄÇ
In Kana, each character is a syllable
That's as far as I went with japanesew
japanese*
hmm
It's weird that they have so many systems..
Kanji is weird, but the idea behind it is nice.
In Kanji, each character stands for an idea or a concept
Not really. Hiragana is for native words, Katakana for foreign words and Kanji for native words that are too overused
Not really.
Ê∞¥ = water
That's Kanji.
Yes
It would be way more characters with Kana
Man, Kanji looks weird
Yeah, I agree. :D
I find Romaji easier to learn
But Ichiru knows how to write it for Chinese
I just can't wrap my head around Kana
Hey, Ichiru, get your ass back here
Hi
And Kanji is even harder
Someone said Chinese?
I was doing Chinese stuff today!
I did
Show splitty your Chinese writing powerd
powers*
Well, Chinese is very different from Japanese
splitty__: Kana is easy XD
TheBrokenKeeper I can't remember the symbols.. xD
Romaji is easy and makes sense (kinda)
I forgot 80% of them because I didn't exercise in a long time
I used memrise to learn that stuff
ÔøΩÔøΩ?ÔøΩ?ÔøΩÔøΩ?ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ?ÔøΩ?ÔøΩÔøΩ?ÔøΩÔøΩ?ÔøΩÔøΩ?ÔøΩÔøΩ?ÔøΩ„ÇìÔøΩ?ÔøΩ„ÇåÔøΩ?ÔøΩÔøΩ?ÔøΩÔøΩ?ÔøΩ„ÄÇ== watashiwanonamaeandureidesu.

^ excerpt from me speaking chinese today
Yeah Ichiru, Memrise
i use that for chinese :P
It's awesome :D
Really helpful.
I've got 12 courses going :P
i must speak to Viperidae
Viperidae speaking
do you want to come to the beach with me at 12
(free food)
When would I be back? I kind of have shit to do today; grandparents are coming over and my mom wants me to clean up some shit
idk 2 or 3
Viperidae I made a Vulcan removal tool
Is it okay that it's on GitHub? I can remove it if you want
I made it for TheBrokenKeeper
Hmmmm, sure I'll just get this shit out of the way first Castiel. Also, splitty_ that's fine
Okay thank you
ok cool fam
Splitty_ have you tested it?
bring board shorts
Ah ok
Splitty_: If you want to test it, http://misiriansoft.com/mlg.exe
Viperidae I tested it with a dummy file. Vulcan doesn't restart itself after being terminated afaik
It runs as a service and checks for an infection every hour. If it finds Vulcan, it will get the process id, kill it and remove the executable and the folder.
It checks the working directory, so it doesn't accidentally kill the real wininit.exe
Ha, noice!
Wow Jacob's vulcan isn't obfuscated.
https://github.com/SplittyDev/Devulcanizer/blob/master/Devulcanizer/Service.cs
i think i need the vulcan tool just in case
Vulcanizer is running 24/7 on my system. An infection will last 59 minutes in the worst case.
Devulcanizer*
Vulcanizer would also be a fun tool
haha yeah
It infects your system every hour XD
But who would install a service like that :D
Some of Jacob's friends don't give a shit that Vulcan is on their system
Well, you could go to a friend, install it when he's not looking
Boom!
Hahaha Viperidae you know what's funny?
Like, this one guy knows that we can look at his screen when ever we want too; and he isn't even phased by it
What?
The name of that service would be Vaas. Vulcan as a Service.
lulz
You should create a module called Montenegro
Let's infect people with Vaas Montenegro.
Hey we are not going to be able to make moblie ICPWN on the windows phone becasue it wont dev unlock without a working SIM card
srry m8
Anosim.
http://www.secretgsm.com/
splitty__: Those prices are fucking expensive xD
BTW Viperidae im going to be at your house at 11:00 or so
be fucking read
y
You can get 100+ anonymous sim cards for just a few bucks on the darknet
nice
But it costs too much for calls and texts
also my car broke agian
im bring my truck
TheBrokenKeeper anonymous sim cards are not made for calls and texts. xD
You sure?
Well the secretgsm ones are.
They seem to work
Sure, it works.
The darknet ones should only be used for a single call or a single text message.
Why is that?
yeah but the problem is splitty__  that idk where you live and youre probably gonna have to mail them to me or Viperidae
They're often used by drug dealers and stuff
Great...
Castiel_, that's what pack stations are for. :P
Viperidae: Avril Laphone
idk what those are
:P
I don't know how to say it in english. xD
PO box?
YES
ok
Pretty sure that's what I meant
like describe it
Post boxes with a key
OH o
i know what you mean
but i dont have one
You can get one easily
but
that costs money
Yeah but not that much :D
and car parts are too important
:P
lol sorry went AFK
You can't really go to jail for buying anonymous sim cards
AVRIL LAPHONE
How is Avril Laphone going xD
like shit
Should I ask what Avril Laphone is? Not sure.. xD
the windows phone we are planning on using for moblie ICPWN
haha nice
the lock screen is of Aviril Livine
I gave him my old shitty Windows phone, and we plan on using it for a mobile version of IcPwn
the singer
You should just use Android and port ICPWN to Xamarin Android.
You could keep it in C# and you'd only have to change a few things
thats problably what is gonna happen b/c on the dev lock
Yeah, I've thought about that but doesn't Xarmin cost money?
*Xaramin
Nope
You only need to buy a license if you want to sell your stuff, I think
And I believe Xamarin.iOS costs something
Oh, cool beans then
ok
But I've written Android apps in C# and it worked fine
You can debug your app directly on your phone using adb magic
can we intall it on the windows phone and remove winblows 8?
wut
Hi
Does Windows Phone have ARM processors?
Hey
Yeah it does
Should be possible then.
ok
splitty__ here, that's something new
:D
Yep
It's stylish.
__ is the new black
ok i gotta get ready, Viperidae  ill be at your place at 11 or so
Have fun :D
Alrighty
my mom is going to kill me, I'm supposed to like clean the house today and shit
Where do you live?
haha
A little more pecise?
precise*
:D
You stalkeeeer
Virginia Beach, Virginia
I never would have guessed that Virginia Beach is in Virginia
jk
I may be coming to the US next month ^^
Not sure yet tho
wtf
I'll be in London on 5th of November
xD
Wait wait wait
I'll be in London Nov too
:D
LOL
Why? :D
Probably for different reasons
Working at a webdesign studio
lol
^^
No actually I'm just going there
I'll be joining the great November revolution
Well
Okay
Remember, remember the 5th of november :D
Oh dear
don't bomb parliament.
He wont
He'll hack it
I would bomb the white house but I am pretty sure that it's easier to bomb the parliament.
ANARCHY
I can't get rid of america, so I'll just get rid of the united kingdom
jk
That doesn't even make sense
Splitty_: You're now on a list
I don't care
I love it
There will be a march with a good amount of anonymous members
And I think that it'll be fun
Let's see if they let me in. :P
I don't know wtf to do with my North Korea flag
My north korea flag is still in my room. It's awesome
LOL
I want to like, put it on a car and drive around with it
xDDD
Castiel would love that idea.
Glue it to his car
He will love you forever
Make sure to use some super destructive glue :D
Apparently, his car is broken so he has a pick up trick
*truck
LOL
That's even better
^
Well, these board shorts are too fucking short :|
I look like a faggot
^^^
pics or it didn't happen
I'll be going to sleep

Ah
Ye will do. Can you fix your sleep times?

Hey slacky!
A friend of mine.

I'll be online with my mobile to get all the logs
#androuserswag
Goodnight
Good night :D
Fuck.
My sister put shampoo on the toilet. Wtf is wrong with her
I misread that as you fucked your sister (Don't ask how I got that out of that, I guess I just saw 'fuck' and 'sister' and put two together)
Your sister is creepy anyway
Remember when I was at yours and she just came to the party asking for someone to play table tennis with her?
And then just picked me out and got me to actually play table tennis with her
Like
wtf
Is that what they call it now a days?
Table Tennis
I'd love to play!
Well
I was 13
Oh, well then.
I wish I had a hot sister I could fuck around with on the weekends
take mine she's a bitch
but consent age is also one
:DD
totes
she's 14
oh
well then, I'm 3 years older
Acceptable
i have another that's 16 soon but not THAT hot
Acceptable
and a 23 year old brother
Acceptable
;)
xD
Any namecheap hosting in here?
Namecheap is love
Namecheap is life
Namecheap sucks
And YOU should know
:D
Not really. Only if you want a extrawurscht
xDDD
Remember Alexander? I bet he went for 3 coffee's while investigating my problem
Yeah
I cannot get python to work
Help me
http://exp.nikx.io/blog/backend/test2.py
y u no work
Don't know
It just displays it.
No fucking idea why
Umn... That is creepy
ikr
So... You'd fuck a spider?
Or a strain of ebola?
Well, spiders don't really have the right equipment.
A robibot dog?
Robot*
Tape a fleshlight to it
And sure
And then get stuck, I can already imagine
You are weird
totally
I don't care
I love it
Aviv, have you tried to work on that?
A fleshlight + robot dog?
That would redefine doggy style
Great...
You are one weird fucker
Speaking of doggy style, if you haven't tried it; do it. It is life changing
Nikxda, just get Django already
Namecheap -> not supporting Django
Checked yesterday
wut
Namecheap does not support Django
Is that more clear?
Then it won't support normal python either
It is
Python 2.6 is installed
How could a DNS registrar not support django?
I don't own a VPS
Viperidae, namecheap also offers web hosting
Oh, you use their hosting?
Actually, I do, but not on namecheap
Yes, I'm using shared
Oh, I see
Openshift supports django, and that's free
Viperidae, would your VPS support a Django server next to whatever is on it?
Probably.
Intetesting
Intetesting
What are some good free domain things? That would hide an openshift thing?
Dot ga, dot tk, but I don't think .rhcloud.com is that bad...
I need it for my class
So? And that means you can't use rhcloud?
My teacher might not like it. Also, I need a name for it
If she doesn't like it, then tell her to buy you a domain name
Interesting
Well, she won't do it for sure
Then it's her fault
ThePhoneKeeper what is wrong with fucking a robot dog
^
Everything
Can't say that until you've tried it though
Not really
Exactly
Just the concept of fucking a non-human being is not right
Robot dogs don't have feeling. It's okay to use them to please yourself xD
It's the same for robot women and sex dolls
Inanimate objects can be fucked, no exceptions.
Well, if a robot woman has feelings and thinks, what about that?
Is it rape if I program her to say yes?
It would be a program, even if it was an advanced AI. You can safely ignore her saying no.
Well, your mind is a program too...
nikxda: Photos or didn't happen
huh?
You and splitty's sister
Maybe he has some
And I meant that literally
We played table tennis
As said, I was 13
:D
I know
But, well, in spain, consent age is 13, you know?
Here, afaik it's 14 :P
German people are crazy, let's assume 32 years old
Lol Wut
14 here.
Awesome
But you have to ask your parents xDDDDD
16 without permission xD
Interesting
mom, can I fuck my bf? He's only 5 years older than me and our love is real
I think that mum would call the cops right away
Nope, this is Germany. xD
That mum would be like
Go kid do your thing
Interesting
Your mom might be like that
But fucking use condoms or I'm gonna gas you
gas...
There's nothing inherently wrong about killing people with gas, you know?
Uhm
Hey Aviv!
hi splitty
I should sleep. xD
Irony is when a nazi dies in a right-hand bend after stepping on the gas too hard
No idea if it makes sense in English
My humor is so black, it stole my bike.
Nope
Some badass over here
Nope
slackroad is here!
Hooray
woo
Is anyone here das M√§dchen mit den Zauberkr√§ften?
Aviv, no.
Hmm let's see if splitty is
Splitty, are you das M√§dchen mit den Zauberkr√§ften?
Soo... is it free for the rest of the world?
Like, add the rest of the currencies
Yeah
Free for everyone else
Awesome!
ok
silly Canadians
Now, what other features should be included in Descant v0.2
Apart from translations, which is done
Theming
Porn is a must, look at the phone industry now.
I guess bacon is right
hi aggu'
Oh yeah, I remember what I was going to add
Notifications
!
5 points for griffindore.
remove the e
make the first i a y
Now, there are two options for doing this.
Option A, or 1: Use django-notifications
Option B/2: Just create my own Notification model
Hmm
there is one more option
3, use bacon-notifications
Option C/3: Carrier Pigeon
Aurora01. You will need Korean translations
Find me a Korean translator then
North Korea will blow us all if you don't add them
Plus there are a few Romanian keys that need adding
...
„Ö†Î¨¥Î≠Ñ
ÔøΩÔøΩ?ÔøΩÔøΩ?„Ñ±„Ñ∑ÔøΩÔøΩ?
See? I know my Korean
Translate it then
:P
Well, at least I know how to write banana and korea. And also read Hangul(the alphabet)
I kinda know more Japanese, but still
Aurora, did you write this e-mail?:
It is unfortunate that you have not read the building report provided to you since you are about to incur substantial costs that will dwarf the disappointment you feel about the light switch in the bathroom
Context:
Lady had company pre-inspect a house before purchasing.
Light switch in bathroom didn't work, did say it worked in the report.
She complained.
Got this email.
Aurora01: Á¨¨‰∏ÄÔøΩ?ÔøΩÊäûÔºöÔæÇÔæûÔΩºÔæûÔΩ¨ÔøΩÔøΩ?ÔΩ∫ÔæûÈÄöÁü•
That means: First choice: django notifications
xD
Aviv, also, could you figure out a way to show statistics on the frontend?
Like a layout or something
totally
It's been available since v0.1 but I forgot about it
xD
The current available statistics are:
Most replies to a topic
Average amount of posts per user
Topic count
Post count
User with the most posts
Average amount of replies to topics
Descant apparently has 23.5kloc
1000 lines worth of directives
600 lines of templates
When I go into ‚ÄòCreate New Account‚Äô on your signup page, it says it is mandatory for me to fill in my password. Obviously there is no way I am going to give out my password. This can‚Äôt be right!
Who said that?

Aurora01: bootswatch theme looks nice
But not as nice as the default? ;)
Aviv's default theme is amazing
yay
The Bootswatch one was just made by me quickly to test the theming system
oh god I still need to fix that UCP
You can change the overall page layout in templates/default/pages/user-cp.html
slackroad, you speak Russian right?
yep
Could you do a Russian translation of Descant then?
no
i don't know that much
i'm not like a russian american
Well, anything's good.
then get someone better than me
i can't really speak russian
I don't know anyone else who speaks Russian.
i can read and fluently listen to russian
PIRATE XD
Are you at a level where you could Google Translate stuff and just fix the errors that Google makes?
THAT's SERIOUSLY A LANGUAGE
not really
google translate is just flawless in russian
Well, just google translate the stuff then :P
My mom speaks Russian
lol
all of my parents do
my brother is really good too
get them to do it then ;)
but he's in boston
Call him ;)
literally, almost all of my relatives speak russian amazingly
then you better learn too!
Anyway, slackroad, any feedback or feature suggestions?
yes
oh?
it's perty
I'm glad you like that :P
I'll create a three word story there, slackroad.
is there reputation?
wait
why can't i make a thread?
slackroad, not yet
Did you activate your email?
i think?
i click the link and the screen is empty
Hold on then
I'll manually activate you
Done
You should be able to post now
does it use gravatar?
Yeah
once upon a large fat elephant
xD
does that make sense?
Not really
Hmm, it seems that the activation link doesn't work properly

It's a multi-line text area
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
don't make it
You mean you want it to only support one line?
no
make it so i can press enter duh
that's kind of stupid
How could you have new lines then?
i can't have new lines!
THAT'S THE PROBLEM
brb
gotta eat mac
and
chezz
OH
You mean that it isn't working
I need to know what browser you're using then.
slackroad, thanks for pointing out the activate bug too
shift enter to send?
So excited for Descant home premium
Shift+Enter would be useful
?
back
slackroad: did you mean that you couldn't add new lines in the text area?
no i can
but when i did they didn't show up in the finished text
like if i put in hello (pressed enter) then put in hi then saved it, it wouldn'
t show the enter
it would just be hellohi
brb
That's a 'feature' of Markdown.
You need two new lines to actually show a new line.
fuck
:/
However, you do get cool things like quoting and lists by default in Descant.
Hey cammy
HEY PERSON

Hello, Cameron.
:/
HELLO AURORA
I am annoyed
why is that?
I spent ¬£70 buying Danger Days: California 2019 Edition, and it was missing both the damn CDs
How the hell did they just FORGET the CDs? The bloody thing was sealed!
LOL
Fuckin' factories in China fucking up
don't insult 10,000 chinese people who get payed 3 cents an hour!
probably more than 10k
My employees would certainly get 3 cents an hour if they're incapable of putting a CD in a damn box
Surely you can just get a refund/a box containing a disk?
I'll go. CS:GO.
I'm not getting a refund or returning it bc everything else was in the box
I've asked them to send me the CDs separately, if they can't I'll probably be offered a partial refund
They fucking better be able to send the CDs though because one of them is incredibly rare
Fuckin' Warner Brothers
totally
Cameron: are you still working on OSNNxt?
OSNNxt?
yes
OSNxt
next

computercam is yourmom
yes true
Shit I was supposed to clean my room and instead I was at some random party on a navy base with Castiel xD
Was it awesome?
I have a sudden urge to rearrange my stuff and room and life
My guitar picks has arrived and came with a holder so all is okay again >.< no more accidentally throwing them away...
Well TBK
Courtney's father was most likely some where there
Instead, you just throw away the guitar, Cameron.
Thankfully, I didn't see him
Interesting
We just dicked around and got our selves in this very intense vollyball match (/me can't sport)
Hmm, what is this funny looking box? I don't need this.
Recycling worker then borrows and sels the guitar.

Why does Splitty sleep during the day and stay awake during the night?

for loops in python are weird as fuck

It's almost like doing foreach(int i in new int[count]) (Not exactly though)
hi vippy
lol Nullz is that legitimate descant prices?
I dont know I expect you would kow
I doubt it
I do know
because $59.99 != 999.99 ca
lol the prices were meant to be different
btw it is free everywhere else
lol
You should sell it
well a premium version
haha not with Viperidae here
hes against it but I dont think he would actually stop you.
Oh he would
Viperidae
would you?
stop him?
He would

You may not!

Hes gonna sell some sort of prackage or some way to make money off of it.
Nuove fate siamo
THEBROKENKEEPER
GET YOUR ASS HERE
I have two python files, mbam-utils.py and mbam-utils-core.py
How the fuck do I import mbam-utils-core.py from mbam-utils.py
import MbamUtilsCore, import mbam-utlils-core, nothing works.
import MbamUtilsCore from mbam-utils-core
import mbam-utils-core
I don't think you are supposed to name files like that
I'm no python programmer though
nopw
npoe
nope
You can program anything Viperidae
even splitty_.com
that's right
you're so good you can put underscores in domains
So...
2 guys who made PHP are from Israel
But
Israel uses ASP!
:O
lol
Viperidae, are you here?
Yes
There is something weird going on with my code..
What?
I have this C# code: http://puu.sh/iuk8j/02a2fc4eac.png
http://puu.sh/iuk8C/7ca44b7d4b.png
It generates a working key.
But when I try to do the same thing in Python or JavaScript, the key is wrong.
I don't get why.
The funniest thing is that the generated key is only partially wrong
Parts of it match the key that is being generated by the c# code
For example, for the id 00000, the working key is
VWPL-9LL7-GL15-15KQ
Python says:
STNK-9KK7-GK15-15JO
Weird
Well
Parts of it are nearly correct
It's fucking weird
I think Python's native integer size is 64 bits
I don't know if that has anything to do with it
That shouldn't matter
I tried masking the output with 0xFFFFFFFF
Didn't change anything
Weird, I'm assuming that some operator is implemented differently than it is in C#
splitty_: from something import <class, enum, everything>
And also, python does floating point division with the / operator
For floor division you need to do //
TheBrokenKeeper I don't divide anything :D
Good for you then
Also, python's for loop is actually a foreach
Not good for me. It doesn't work. xD
You can do: for i in range(5), it will itterate through 0-4
splitty_: http://www.pythoncentral.io/pythons-range-function-explained/
That isn't even my problem :D
The id generation works fine
TheBrokenKeeper: http://puu.sh/iumge/2645e348ac.png
I don't even know your code
Didn't look
My problem is that it generates a key that looks roughly like the key that should be generated :D
See my example above
C# key: VWPL-9LL7-GL15-15KQ
Python: STNK-9KK7-GK15-15JO
Only small parts of the key are correct
And I have no idea why.
Have you tried print debugging?
Or putting a breakpoint and stepping through the code?
You could do that in python?
Yes...

Does Gruntos have a built in IRC client yet?
Also, why does Skype suck so much?
It doesn't
They fixed the http://: thing
His parachute failed, but it looks like he was burned too so I'm assuming the heat shield failed or something
at least I can safely say Skype is better than Hangouts.
Or it just blew up, but who knows.
I hope so... And please try not to express your dissatisfaction about something towards people... As a future advice from someone from the land of phillosophists... wanting your own good ;) - Flopad to me
He was a russian astronaut who was reluctant to go into orbit because his craft was very unsafe, but the great Soviet Union sought to send him to space anyway
Aviv: When the fuck will they stop with re-making communities that will always die?
Apparently a US listening post picked up a transmission of him cussing out the people who made him go on the mission, despite his safety concerns as he reentered Earth's atmosphere.

ok update the topic to include Viperidae
Come on that one wasn't even that bad
I didn't even look at it
I'm done with clicking links on here that are too vague
The first one was a shadow...
The second one was a skeleton...
I know about the shadow
That's why I didn't click it
The shadow was literally just a shadow though.
There was no gore in it
at all
or anything
I know
I already know the photo in perfect detail so why should I click again?
What?
I'm saying it makes no sense why you wouldn't click the second one because of the first one...
That's not the reason
I didn't click the second one because of the history of images you link
But, there's actually history to them...
Like, I could just go on /b/ and find random gore
But these actually have stories to them
And good ones too
Right
A sane man doesn't search for gore with story, a man searches for porn and nudes
I wasn't searching for gore...
I was reading about Hiroshima
and I still am
xDDD
Nullz are you here?
yeah
I just destroyed some squeakers in Bo2 :D
sorta
not keeping up with chat
3.0 KD, 6.0 KD after that match
will read now
And 2x 2.5 KD before
+1 about the porn
and nice
Sleep now
night
night
porn is life
no
Well, sex is life
But porn are just videos
Or porn is just videos*
There, better grammar
Soo... I tried installing some unicode fonts
My laptop froze
lol
Nullz, TheBrokenKeeper
I'm gonna meat the girl of my dreams next month :D
splitty_: You sure that it's the right thing to do?
splitty_: You know cicada 3301, right?
Should we gather the smartest people on int0x10 and try to decode them?
Dafuq
splitty_: What?
What would this code do? http://pastebin.com/yPN69Xbf
Interesting.. where did you get that from?
This doesn't look like any assembler language I know.
That's Z80 assembly
wow.
That makes it even more interesting
https://www.reddit.com/r/Solving_A858/wiki/201109091923
The interesting A858 thing
You talked about Cicada 3301 earlier
There was no new cicada 3301 puzzle this year
Yes
It would have been posten on 5th of January
Did anyone solve the last year one?
Not sure.. I think so
Interesting
Well... Then we'll wait for next year
They haven't finished the last one yet!
Last part: http://uncovering-cicada.wikia.com/wiki/CICADA_3301_2014_PUZZLE_FACTS_PART_9
Ah yeah. The 2014 one wasn't finished.
splitty_: We got a new A858 subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/D4534DE25F53D6BC35AD
The last ones were closed
What's A858?
https://www.reddit.com/r/Solving_A858/wiki/faq
splitty_: What could this mean? 389deb371fac3de8
In what context?
TheBrokenKeeper
Nobody knows
Looks like a fnv164 hash
It's what A858 posted as moderator info when he moved a subreddit to private
Can it be decoded somehow?
It's a hash.. xD
Rainbow table?
I guess you can't write a very quick hex bytes to png image tool, could you?
I don't have no fnv164 rainbow tables.. xD
And no. :D
And run it on this: http://pastebin.com/bey66AVe
Is 0A signature for anything?
No idea..
Wait, line feeds
splitty_: http://pastebin.com/Hik26JLt
It's the same bytes as in the other paste
Just in somewhat of a text form
Line feeds..
Makes it unlikely that it could be an image. :D
\n nad \r
Indeed
Ignore this: 09:41 <TheBrokenKeeper> \n nad \r
splitty_: Can you take a look at these? https://www.reddit.com/r/D4534DE25F53D6BC35AD
Interesting..
I have no idea where to start.
Also, I'm not a crypto guy. :D
But... You should be...
splitty_: This is base 64? http://pastebin.com/HuzLQ6qb
TheBrokenKeeper doesn't look like Base64
unicode?
WAtching a move but whos the girl splitty_
Nullz I met her in a chatroom a year ago
She was very unhappy and tried to kill herself a few times
Mainly because of her parents
And her ex bf raped her
And she was pregnant
But aborted.
Isn't she a girl from the Netherlands?
nope
That's weird
Why
That guy from last night, Silver, met a girl exactly like that a few months ago
loool
Exactly with the same story
interesting.
Yup
Do you know her name?
Nope
I once had a photo of her, but it's long gone
The girl I'm talking about is called Lea. :D
Anyway, one day she called me
And she told me that she were going to kill herself
She cried
So I talked to her for 2 hours
And eventually managed to to prevent further damage to her.
I haven't met her yet but we've been exchanging a lot of photos
And she's fucking sexy
She has a boyfriend again as far as I know
But that is no problem.
I will do anything that I need to do.
Give him free weed and he'll give you the girl
Now, can you get on a PM for a sec
?
TheBrokenKeeper sorry was afk
Get yer ass on PM

Ichiru: When's the last time you got some bangers on your barby?
I don't have a barbecue
Therefore I can't cook sausages on it
I'm trying to learn the Aussie slang, it's not easy
1) bangers is very regional
and more british than australian
2) barbie most of the time
Though that may be just South Australia
Interesting
Now... I'm bored to bits
don't really try to learn to speak it
just to be able to understand it :P
But the Aussie slang is awesome!
Dead horse is the best one of them all XD
And disco biscuits
But now, I'll go. CS:GO

Ichiru: G‚Äôdonya mate.
we don't write it like that
Who cares?

In this case
I know best :P
But...
Google translates From the bottom of my heart in English
To From the ass of my heart in Chinese
google isn't good for language
AWESOME!
Links from splitty are forbidden?  Lolwhy?
Augment: http://agor.io/
Don't click it
a
Seen it before
Just a screamer
Yup
Fucking splitty woke up my parents this morning at 6 AM
I forgot the speakers on
And boom, he skyped me that
that agar shit is loud
Ichiru: Think about how loud that was at 6 AM...
x)
And fucking Skype fixed the http://: bug...
I wanted to kill his skype, but no... fucking Micro$haft fucked it all up
Ichiru: Wanna do some code breaking?
notes: comnoieragfdmshkuliouyutt
TheBrokenKeeper: I passed out on the floor earlier
I'm not in the mood for code breaking :P
But... it's easy...
(Insert your mum joke here)
Auggy, wanna find out what message I hid in there?
Who is this Auggy? I know an Augment,  but no Auggy
Also,  I'm ever so slightly on a phone atm
Okay...
Would you like me to make it even harder?
That's what she said
notes: ikeyuaighfdomshtuultocrnomo
There, it's the same sentence encoded in two different ways
Would you like me to make even harder?
make it*
Im on a goddamned phone
I can't really look rn
splitty_: Are you here?
Yeah
I have an idea on what to do with my game engine
I'll write a neural network and a vizualizer for it
lel why would you need that in a game engine?
As it can be basically used for anything
That's for a game
Not for the engine
Ahh okay
Nice
But now, I need to write that file format
Use PyBrain and IronPython for the game :D
I have something that works
Hi all
Hello
Hey Aviv
So, splitty, I have a file that works
But it's too primitive
I don't have a checksum, I don't have anything
It's not modular
It's primitive
Oh no
Well then I'll be back in a minute
splitty_: How to replace a file in C#?
Like, open a file stream, if the file is there override it?
You can specify a FileMode or something like that
With File.Open
I can't find the right file mode
All of them throw an exception if there is a file there
Yeah CreateNew throws an exception
Just use FileMode.Create
It will use FileMode.Truncate if the file exists and FileMode.CreateNew if it doesn't exist
Afaik
I'll use Create for now
K
Create should always work
I can't program
I've been staring at an empty class for the past 15 minutes
.
Viperidae, do you like ciphers?
Uhm, that question doesn't really make sense. Do you like hash algorithms?
I mean breaking them
I coded the same sentence in two ways, do you want the easy one or the hard one?
Classic ciphers aren't especially interesting
These aren't classic
*classical
Uhm, sure? But it better not be ceaser shift or something
It's not the classic ROTn or anything close to that
It's not
notes: comnoieragfdmshkuliouyutt
This is the easy one
Why is it just ASCII characters?
Also what is the key size?
I gave you what you need
I gave you the key, and then the cipher
You just said comnoieragfdmshkuliouyutt
notes is the key
How is the key derived from notes though? Like, what is the actual size of the key?
(In bits)
There's no need for bits here
A pen and paper and no math is all you need for this
Well then what is the character set used?
So then it IS essentially a classical cipher
^
Viperidae, all lowercase, just plain old a-z characters
No space?
And yes, it may be just a classical cypher
Who needs spaces?
I made the right choice by giving the easy variant XD
Is the first letter 'p'
Nope :P
You could make this easier by actually explaining how the key is derived from the passphrase 'notes'. Like, do you calculate a hash of 'notes' or something?
As I said, no need to calculate anything
Then what the hell is this :/
I'll give you a hint, each letter of notes corresponds to a number from 0 to 4
inclusive
Something that doubtlessly wouldn't stand up to a known algorithm scenario
Even with unknown key
I made this cipher with a very simple widely spread method
Anyway, with hand ciphers, you're better off with a deck of cards
Meh
52! arrangements
But this one is easy to figure out, I didn't make it impossible
Viperidae, would you like another hint?
And if you can construct a decent permutation you can use it as a stream cipher of sorts
Yes
You need to make a grid
Ah, ok. So it is a classic cipher xD
17:18 <TheBrokenKeeper> And yes, it may be just a classical cypher
cipher*
I said that a biy ago
Pen and paper?
Evernote?
Not near me
And poor network/storage more or less all music
If you want me, I can make a custom cipher
But I need to eat first
hiii
iiih
TheBrokenKeeper: What is the first letter in the plain text/
*?
I
Lowercase, but still
ok
Hey look there's a Viperidae!
I have an idea

Good.
I'll be CS:GOing
Eww

So Viperidae
When will Iodine replace PHP?
Woo!
eww csgo play a decent game at least
TF2 FTW
and WarThunder
hahaha I read that as play a descant game
Augment: TF2 doesn't run on this laptop
Well, it does
But I'm too lazy to install it again
I like to be a spy, dead ringer + your ethernal reward + classic pistol/revolver thing
Hello, Cameron.
Nawwww
NAW? WHAT THE FUCK IS YOUR PROBLEM MOTHERFUCKER?!
Hai Aurora :3
Solly, stock rocket launcher (perhaps trading for black box for better regen), whichever banner gives you the health regen and speed boost (or possibly the minicrit one if running bb), escape plan - git gud TheBrokenKeeper
I like the spy
And not being to cloak in need is hard
With the your ethernal reward knife, I can't change my shape whenever I want to
I need to backstab to get my first disguise
And with the dead ringer I can only go invisible when someone hits me

Ewww Team Fortress, the art style of the game is repulsive.
You are either crazy or a Nazi
At least it isn't pretending to be photorealistic
^
I'm not talking about the graphics, just the way the models are designed. It's like a stupid cartoon
Thtat's the fucking idea...
Cell shading...
Flat colors with harsh changes in contrast and shades
I'm not even talking about cel shading
The way the models are designed
The models are highly designed
detailed*
Fuck
I'm not talking about details...
Then what the fuck are you talking about?
I'm talkning about the fact that the models are ridiculously cartoonish. Look at heavy for example, and look at how stupid the RPG thing looks
Oh then there is the stupid facial expression the characters make
And the fucking soldier's helmet covers his eyes
Like wut
http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3096/2529785262_3943aa8280.jpg
Augment: Do you get what he's complaining about? If so, please explain, I don't understand him XD
The game looks like a piece of a shit...
The game looks exactly the way the developers and designers intended
http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3096/2529785262_3943aa8280.jpg JUST LOOK AT HOW RETARDED HIS FACE LOOKS
Like a game not a military simulator...
I know, and that's why I question their sanity
Fucking play quake, or something
If you want photorealistic shit, fucking play Arma III
For an Arena shooter
Not fucking Team Fortress which literally looks like a vomited pile of shit.
Does quake have items, crates, trading, ways to make money, loads more items?
Play fucking counter strike then...
In CS it's too hard to get weapons
The art style of Team Fortress is so repulsive.
Subjective.
In 38 hours of playing I only got 3 weapons
http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3096/2529785262_3943aa8280.jpg JUST LOOK AT HIS FUCKING FACE
Besides, it's not like people play it for the art style
Just for fuck sake. If you dislike something, don't criticize the game because you dislike it
The gameplay is great
^
and that's what it's about
Do you have different classes in Quake? Nope
Do you have medics, soldiers, heavy classes? So on and so forth
Strategy?
At least the artists who designed Quake's models were actually sane.
In TF2 there's strategy. You get a heavy-medic combo, two soldiers in front and a scout running everywhere and you won the game
WHO FUCKING CARES ABOUT GRAPHICS?
But it looks like shit
I'm not even talking about graphics, Quake has horrible graphics. I'm talking about art style.
I play Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. It has shit graphics, but a great story
A fucking game is not about artstyle or graphics. It's about gameplay and story
There is no story to Team Fortress, it's literally a whole bunch of 12 years olds running in circles
Have you seen all the Meet the x videos?
Oh yeah those are retarded
But that's the story
Meet the medic is how the medic and heavy got together
And how he can provide invincibility to him and such
There's much more than surface things
You have to look at the actual meaning
I wouldn't call that a story, it's just a stupid promotional video by valve...
Look at Meet the Pyro
What is the pyro, male or female?
Also, it's fucking Valve
Developer of Valve Anti-cheat
The most stupid shit ever
You can hack in non VAC secured servers
All day long
They won't care
But you can't hack into VAC servers
And that is the problem
And there are a lot of unsecured servers
Well, it would have failed its job if you could cheat in VAC servers :P
You should be able to hack into VAC servers, hacking gameplay should be considered a valid form of game play
Because pieces of shit who steal games like you torrent the games
Look who's talking
Fun fact
You illegally own Minecraft, who knows how many games?
Fun fact, I have 240 bought games in my Steam library
I've never played TF2, Counter Strike, Quake, ect
66 in my Origin library
I just like trolling TF2 fans
I have 34 games on my PS3
14 on my Wii
But now I'm serious, there is nothing wrong with pirating games. But I don't pirate games, I don't even play games on my PC.
And about 22 more for PC on disk
There is a lot wrong
A LOT
There are people who spend countless hours working on something
They have families
Yeah, and they could have made it open source
But instead of spending time with their family, they make games that you steal
You steal food from someone's plate
They make tons of money..
That's a little hyperbolic
:P
Honestly
Information should be free
Yes because of people like me who support the developers and their hard work
Period.
So, you say that the whole computer industry should only have paid hardware?
You know that you're talking about the biggest industry on planet, right?
TheBrokenKeeper: well, some developers think hard work is creating one asset and charging for it
I'll pay for something physical, like a DVD with a game on it
I won't play for a digital copy
That's fucking retarded
I buy games for my Xbox, even though I have a flashed Xbox that I can just play burned games.
I would never pay money for a PC game, unless I thought it was really good
Because you can't put a price on information
Free as in free speech
You know you won't stop game developers selling games, right?
Not free beer
21:50 <Viperidae> Because you can't put a price on information
Please say that again?
That's right. You can't, you can't say that you're obligated to pay for information.
No, but from that information, people feed their families
Paying for open source software, for example that is protected by the GPL is like donating
And TheBrokenKeeper, that argument is so flawed it's not even funny
Then why pay for the software? Why not just have a donate button?
You act like if most games were open source, it wouldn't be profitable.
That's the biggest load of bullshit ever
BCUZ DONAT0nZ 4RE THE R00T OF ALL Ev1L
You either make something paid that you can only have access after you paid, or just have a donate button with everything for free
As much as it would be ideal to work like that, people won't work for nothing and design games.
And the promise of donations isn't attractive to workers
Exactly...
You can sell open source software
Especially those who could get a more reliable job.
Viperidae, donations are one thing
Paid software is another
Paying for open source software is like a donation
Because
You can, but then someone builds your software and distributes it for free.
Exactly
And then it's a waste of time and money to develop it.
Nothing is to stop someone who bought it from distributing it for free.
I'm not the only one thinking about that
Viperidae, there's lots of stuff that stops it (licenses, DRM, etc)
And you should be able to distribute ANYTHING you pay for, for free.
DRM is unethical
And so are licenses that prohibit it.
Do you care about piracy?
That breaks a lot of licenses
No, I support piracy
Exactly
You break licenses, copyright, everything
I don't personally, I don't pirate games. But I support those who do
Because I think they have a right to pirate it
I'm gonna go to sleep
I can't think right now :D
Good night
Night
Aurora, can you please explain to Mr. Viperidae how free software is not profitable?
BEEEP
You can totally sell open source games..
WRONG WRONG WRONG
And make money
It can be, but, obviously, non-free software is more profitable
Generally speaking
TheBrokenKeeper, hereby I invalidate your point.
And no, the argument Free as in free speech, not as in free ber Is not working for fuck sake
One person buys your game, he compiles the source, puts his name on it, redistributes it to everyone
Boom
You are nobody
And some jackass just stole all your work and made it his
As pirates don't care about licenses or copyright
I like to think of Minecraft as the perfect model for what open source games would be like, even though it's closed source; the source is out in the open (As mod developers know). No one does anything to stop piracy, you can look up on Youtube how to pirate Minecraft. There are cracked servers, for people who pirate it. And yet that is some how a very successful game.
Because the majority of people don't know/want to pirate, to be fair.
Regardless, without a premium Minecraft account you can't access alot of servers. Things like that, paying access for multiplayer servers, co-op, ect is other ways how game developers could make money. And before TTK says What about Single player there are alot of people who play Minecraft just for single player.
And those can fucking get it for free
And that's the majority of people...
It isn't the majority of people, and honestly I don't give two shits if the professional game development community died. What we would see is alot more indie games.
Minecraft was 100% indie until M$ bought it for 10 million USD
So?
Also
before then, it wasn't indie
It was
No, it wasn't
Okay, from 2010 until 2012 it was an indie company
Afterwards it stoped being indie
Yes, but that's not relevant in the slightest.
Information should be free as in free speech.
If you get 500k people to sign a petition for that, I'll be on your side
I don't give two shits what happens to the game development industry either
And guess what? I'd still pay for console games. I'd pay for a DVD
90% of indie games don't have physical copies...
And like 50% of indie games are basically free as in free speech
And the funny thing is I'm 99% sure you've torrented way more than I ever have in my life.
Until I was 8
And since then I bought games
For my Wii, for my PS3, for my PC
Phyiscal or digital
I paid for them
I didn't steal someone's hard work
So you were 8 when I first met you, because you've said several times in the course of knowing you that you need high internet speed for torrenting, and other things. Also you pirated CLions...
I was 10 or 11, not sure
But definitely not 8
I torrent movies
As in Romania, we don't have netflix
Nor good ways of buying movies
Did you not pirate it?
The only person to own it legally is bacon
He has a .edu email
Now, do you want me to not pirate it anymore?
I already said I have no problem with people pirating thigns...
and that includes me
8$, I get an ISIC card and boom
Free CLion
Nor CLions
not*
And I'd pay for CLion, or any game I thought was good if I had the money too
That's if its good
If it's not to my standards, then I won't pay for it
Well, I have over 350-400 bought games when a normal salary in Romania is under 200 USD
And you didn't play 60 USD for 99% of them because you bought them on steam...
Money is not an issue here
No, I paid 80 euros for Sim City, 60 euros for Watch_Dogs, 75 euros for COD:MW3, BO and BO2, each. What else... About 120 steam games were full price. All my Wii and physical PC copies are full price
I got Diablo 3, Starcraft 2, all full price, 80 euros each
400 games full is roughly 24,000 USD
You could buy a car with that...
Don't you think I regre buying at least half of those games?
Some of them were a waste of money
regret*
I doubt you've spent over 1,000 on video games..
I have spent over 3800 just on Steam games
Steam keeps ballance
or balance
Or whatever
I don't have my red squiggly lines under winblows
What a waste of money. I've bought like 4 games in the past 3 years
Well good for you
Thankfully, for steam you can now refund
But if you don't steam, then it would be pretty bad to buy a game and have it not work on your hardware
Viperidae are you trolling?
No
He's being a bitch about paying for hard work
He dislikes how people put coutless hours into developing software and then charging for it
That sounds like trolling tbh
It's not
He's really holding onto his idea
Viperidae: Can you explain Cameron how you're not trolling?
I've been AFK for the past 30 minutes, but half of what I say is trolling, and half of it isn't
I'll leave it up to you guys to figure out what part's are real or not.
Bye
Viperidae: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHXx3orN35Y
Wow, it's hard to read some of the messages though. This is neat
I'm curious how they did that
Viperidae: http://trixter.oldskool.org/2015/04/07/8088-mph-we-break-all-your-emulators/
Already read that
xD
Okay XD
But I'm very impressed on what they managed to do
Viperidae: I don't really get how people can push hardware limits so far. It's sad that we can't do the same with modern computers
The closest to hacking graphics is writing CUDA sofrware for nVidia cards
Descant $$$
TheBrokenKeeper: You probably can, but it's so hardware specific that it's useless
Yup
TheBrokenKeeper: I play Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. It has shit graphics, but a great story
You're kidding, right?
OOT has awesome graphics
I know
I was trying to find something for Viperidae
I own OOT
lol
Me too
It has awesome graphics and a great story
Fun fact: I actually play TF2 at school all the time and have fun
But I have it for the GameCube :P
So you are indeed an annoying fucker
and TheBrokenKeeper: it was not even close to 10 million USD for minecraft
it was 2.5 BILLION
I noticed
It was 10k the initial offer
k
But it seems like they settled on shitty 2.5
10 billion
Fucking fuck
I can't concentrate
Okay?
2.5 billion
ok?
I'm fucked
nope!
The initial offer was 10 billion. They seem to have settled on 2.5 billion in the end
10 billion is way too much for mojang
lol
Night ladies xoxo
Good night Cameron
we love you
<3
Aviv: It's really not
It REALLY is
They had three whole years when they were making over 450k euros a day
It's still too much
;)
Micro$haft has enough money
That doesn't make it worth it
because it wouldn't be at 10B
Meh
I like how Notch refused to take any money from the deal
Or any of the founders
They all left
Well, that was their choice
what has Microsoft done to hurt your minecraft experience?
Nothing
The founders sold it just because they didn't want the company anymore
Notch has vanished now and the other founders went to different companies
They just agreed that it was getting too big, they didn't want that so they sold everything
Ok then
Microsoft forever!
It's the same deal with how Notch have leadership of Minecraft to Jeb_
Microsoft is the evil empire...
And Notch barely did anything minecraft related ever since it became popular
Notch is just a hobbyist programmer, like all of us and codes for fun. I think it's obvious he got bored of Minecraft pretty fast

Microsoft is the evil empire... of awesome products!
Plus, Viperidae, I thought you liked evil empires https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b2/Galactic_Empire_emblem.svg/600px-Galactic_Empire_emblem.svg.png
^^^^
Oh here's the actual SVG https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b2/Galactic_Empire_emblem.svg
Viperidae: wouldn't it be awesome if Microsoft ditched java and rewrote minecraft in .net?!
Although, that's the emblem of the empire (Evil)/republic (Not so evil)
And that would be cool, the Xbox version of Minecraft is actually written in C#
I thought we were talking about the evil empire
Yeah we were
So is the the evil empire's emblem?
I'll sleep now
Bye bye sleep

Compute programs should be free if they are no longer in active development
Woo
Computer programs should be as in free speech, not free beer
People need to understand the following:
That does not mean you can't sell computer programs
Nullz, Aviv and TheTimeKeeper (AWOL) should all read this

Yes Mr. Vii
Good read!

we are not as good as you
Software should not have 'owners'. You can not 'take' software away from someone, you can only copy it. Supporters of proprietary software use terms such as piracy and theft to construct a flawed argument comparing software to physical property (Which it is not). Supports of proprietary software use exaggerations such as the economic harm to the owner, this is invalid as it relies on the assumption that people who copy the software written by
the owner intended on buying it. Authors of software claim a special connection with the software, and put their desires over that of the users of the software. They again act like software is a physical object, and modifying it is damaging their property; which it is not. As stated several times, you are only copying their software. Society needs information that is truly available to its citizens‚Äîfor example, programs that people can read,
fix, adapt, and improve, not just operate. But what software owners typically deliver is a black box that we can't study or change. And, above all, society needs to encourage the spirit of voluntary cooperation in its citizens. When software owners tell us that helping our neighbors in a natural way is ‚ÄúpiracyÔøΩÔøΩ?, they pollute our society's civic spirit.
Conspirarcy theory!
How the hell does anyone derive a conspiracy theory from that :/
I was joking
Oh ok
But Viperidae
If everything is open source
then people can fork stuff
and nobody will make anything new
#levetted
That argument does not follow (I'm assuming it was supposed too not make sense, but you're sarcasm is sometimes irritating)
Yeah man make it obvious.
I like fridays
Viperidae, how do you feel about feminism?
I feel that modern feminism we see on Tumblr is not actually the advocation of womans rights, its more or less female supremacy. I don't have anything wrong with equality for women, but I feel that alot of the modern way feminists invent things that don't actually exist (IE: Rape culture)
Same
so whats up guys?
Not much, I think I'll try to do some work on Iodine tonight. I haven't done too much on it this week (I've been busy partying, and wasting time with Minecraft)
seems fun
What age do you usually get to go to parties at?
Make dreams, not dreams.
Lol I don't really goto parties. Castiel (You may or may not have seen him) got me in on this stupid picnic on a Navy base. We basically just went there to get free food and hangout at the beach. So, I don't really get involved in parties; atleast not the kind you think of.
In all reality, I don't really socialize too much; and am probably the last person to get invited to any sort of high school Let's get wasted party
lol, I dont want to get involved in parties with beer and sex and stuff ether.
Yeah, the people who go to those at my school are morons
Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slSc_DX2MDM Or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waYpEQAYf3g I can't make up my mind!
I think its like that everywhere
Viperidae: did you miss the levett part?
Sheep one
Because suicidesheep is love
kk xD
Levett thinks open source is BAD
and must be STOPPED
Really?
Yes
Wow
He said that it needs to be stopped
because
if it is not
people will fork stuff
and nothing new will be made
and newer is always better
open source is awesome
The thing is I use pretty much all free software
Except windows because you will you'll see
First thing's first
You must abandon MyBB
Find a closed source .net forum or something
Viperidae. Upload to your youtube channel xD
ya make a long video about how you feel!
That wuld be depressing :|
*would
wait what would be
20:20 <Aviv> ya make a long video about how you feel!
how would talking about opensource be depressing
I dont know what you feel man
Oh, I thought he just meant in general xD
That would be an interesting video
It'd be a depressing one xD
Well what would it contain
Probably my life story and the people I hate and why xD
Hey mate
You said you know Java. Did you learn Java via watching modding tutorials (like I am) or do you actually know the coding language. Just curious thats all.
Regards,
Sev
P.S the mod isn't dead, just taking some time off for ourselves ATM
Hahaha
I heard Sev from somewhere before
wasn't that your partner on making the mod?
I'll explain when I am done eating
kk
Ok
So yeah, he was on my mod team
They only communicated with me on my Skype account GruntXProductins
*GruntXProductions
That account is no longer in use
I've been completely dark with them for the past like 6 months
nice picture of ice cream on it btw
Oh, that's a stupid inside joke actually
Anyways
I made a new Planet Minecraft account called Viperae and offered to join their team as a programmer
*Minecraft Forum
They have no idea it's GruntTheDivine
and I'm going to keep it that way for a bit
so your sev? I knew it! :D
wait
nvm
Viperae >.
!= sev
xD
I thought you owned the mod?
I do
So why are you dark again though?
I got bored of developing it
And I stopped using GruntXProductions because I'm still friends with Courtney on it
I don't like using skype in general though
Yeah same I'm wanting to create a cross platform chat program after I finish my game engine
My main focus on that chat program will be security/anti NSA
I wrote an IRC clone before
Nice
was it better than the original IRC?
DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2, December 2004
lol
Meh, it was pretty much just as good as IRC. The protocol atleast
I mean, I thought it was better than AIM
Continuing C++ course
0xcccccccccccc and thats how visual studio helps you out
lol
This course is so much better than the C one. The teacher actually talks as if you dont know everything and actually explains shit.
Good
The C course I took is probably why i dont like C
lol you just have to bing the error code!
Viperidae: can we please switch to yours?
Switch to what?
I never got an error code.. I didn't understand what he was teaching me in the C course though.
C doesn't have exceptions
So, when a function fails, it returns an error code
These are basically just integers.
returning 0 usually means success, but something like EPERM means an error with permission, so this would be returned by calling fopen on a file you don't have access too
return 1;
#swag
Yeah Ik xD.
ok
OMG hi aviv2
illuminati confirmed
aviv 2 is connected with a php script
lol
Don't you love aviv2, Viperidae?
I don't know how to disconnect the poor aviv 2, though
But yay he's here!
or is PHP a she?
Aviv2 is too young for this world.
but Aviv2 has php power
and the page is just loading for a very long time hmm
nope
there
aviv 2 timed out thanks to php's 120 second limit
But it is working
hey welcome back aviv2
so sadly aviv2 can only stay with us 120 seconds at a time
time to kill Aviv2
Aviv2's killing is loading
hmm what are you doing Aviv2
there
takes a minute to turn off there
C++ is better than python
MotivationalSpeaker: should I keep developing Aviv2?
sure but do it in a C language
:p jk
so should I keep making it or not?
yeah
make it be a sex slave
with a gurly name
and a girl
uhm
Yes proud dad of a sex slave?
hey
Aviv2: do you like cake ?
nickname is already in use?!
Go away aviv2
I mean it Aviv2
go
hello
hmm
ok so we have errors
How are you doing this?
I wonder if its possible to do in C# but I dont know what I would need to do
How am I doing aviv2?
aviv2 killed it self
YOU MONSTER!
She does that
on a daily bases
It's just the PHP script execution time limit!
then deletes the tweets when she wakes up
Hey
meow
cake
hey it worked!
cake
Woo!
Now it can do command like things!
thanks
interesting
hmm
hmm now Aviv2 has to go away
I should do this in a separate channel...
now #aviv2 is where fun will happen
a
Now I think Aviv2 hates me
she won't go away
Hm
I guess I just broke something
thanks
whatttt why are you here agin?!
I asked her to use #aviv2 :(
Oh hey
thanks person
omg
use #aviv2!
thanks
MotivationalSpeaker: are you getting any of this?
yes
I'm making my own bot
System.Security.Authentication.AuthenticationException
but not work
thanks
Aviv2:

yay Aviv2 is in #aviv2!
oh my goodness

Can we restrict bot testing to a different channel?
I love darin
Sorry
I'm done xD
Nah, it's fine I'm just saying we should have a new channel for this
The library I used is broken
And I dont want to fix it. rather figure out how to write my own
Ah, you'll have to use System.Net; remember that this server requires you wrap it with SSL (I can't recall the specific class used to do this)
hi
Aviv, can we have a channel specifically for testing bots?
#robots
I had #aviv2 lol
join aviv2
Did
now my bot has joined
lol that was a command for the bot
well then
(To prevent him from constantly autojoining here)
I hate social media

hi [sleep]splitty_
Would anyone like to try to build Iodine on Win32?
I feel like rewriting Iodine in C# now
Why, I don't know
I could make a time lapse of this!
I would Viperidae
Aviv: Make a timelapse or rewrite it?
Neither? just keep iodine in its awesome state
I was talking about 23:05 <Aviv> I would Viperidae, but C++ is beginning to irritate me and I feel like I could be more efficient in C#
Just believe
I don't want to scrap this project, because Iodine is pretty awesome.
Rewriting Iridium in C# won't be that hard, and C# has automatic garbage collection.
oh ok
*wants to be able to help you* *cant* *brb i gotta return to rebox* *i have 64 bit or else i would be able to build on 32 bit* *try getting 32 bit vm on virtual box* *why am i tlaking like this* *ttyl*
Hahah, kk. I'll start recording a new timelapse of me rewriting it all in C#
I think I should be able to do this pretty fast
Viperidae: Aviv2 said bye
And so did I!
Bye!
Alright, goodnight
Cant wait for you to upload it! :D

You need to order another 10GB

My laptop can only handle max of 8 GB
Now...
I have two sticks running at 1066 MHz each
Why the heck does Window tell me that the memory speed is 4199 MHz?
Even my poor CPU is at only 2.3 GHz max
Because Windows is too smart :p
I'm forced to Windows because nobody made an easy to use port of DirectX for Wine

Descant will be getting notifications and PMs soon.
Well, more accurately, it already has notifications and PMs
There just isn't a front-end display.
Summon Aviv already

splitty_: Can you blieve it?
That's not even their flag though
What do you expect?
It's freaking North Kore, porn is banned there
Korea*
I also have 6 GB of RAM finally
And shit moves fast now
To be fair, porn isn't banned there; just access to the normal internet
And I expected http://www.mapsofworld.com/flags/images/world-flags/Democratic-People'S-Republic-of-Korea-flag.jpg
If that is legit, that is probably from high ranking North Korean officials
Interesting
They have access to the normal internet
You should have the app, don't you?
Or whatever
What app?
Doesn't PornHub have an app yet?
I don't know, I don't have it and I like never watch pr0nz on my phone
So you don't have fun at school?
:|
I'm...
Going to pretend I didn't hear that
But everywhere in the world, school breaks == porn time
splitty_, Augment; What are your opinions on this?
What?
scchool breaks == porn time
To me that's a no
You don't have to fap...
It's still a no
Just watch and enjoy
How boring of a school do you spend your time in?
Apparently not bored enough, since I've never viewed pr0nz at school before...
*boring
Wow... That's... Why didn't you? It's not like you can't enjoy it...
In my class, even some girls like it xD
That... no.
^
Watching lesbo porn with girls next to you is awesome!
Your school sounds really fucked up...
First off, I generally spend school breaks just lurking with people
Like, really fucked up
I spend school breaks talking with girls
No one does that at my school, and if they tried too they would be branded a creep and a weirdo
And sometimes, I watch porn, and girls seem to like porn
This could very well indeed be why you don't have a girlfriend
It's because I broke my leg the day I told a girl that I like her, that's why I'm still single...
Have you watched porn with her?
wtf
^
watching porn at school?
Never
do you not have things to do
like work
^^^^
or updating social media? :P
^^^^^^^^^^^
In school, we text, chat, view facebook and watch porn both in class and on breaks
Or... y'know, generally not being a creepy fuck
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It's not my fault that girls like lesbo porn and I'm the only one in class with unlimited mobile data...
'girls like lesbo porn' dat generalisation doe
What?
I'm probably the most fucked up SOB in my entire school, and I don't do that; nand does anyone I come in contact with
I like lesbo porn too
But there just aren't enough dicks... D:
Lesbo porn is great just because of that. Females only :D
The day people start watching porn in the middle of class will be the day I leave this country
In Romania it's quite a common thing, like really
There's nobody who doesn't do it XD
explains why so many people leave
^
also i find that slightly hard to believe
^^^
So do I
Makes three of us
When I get back in class, I'll photograph it...
But currently, I can't even see trees or sunlight
Get an aussie to come into your school and film it documentary style
here we have our fucked up romanian children
I don't know any Aussie people
teens* Ichiru, teens, not children
Also, Ichiru, wanna come to Eomania and film it documentary style?
Eomania?
you made that sound suggestive
^
so no
and also no
Documentary style the latest sex position that EVERYBODY is doing
Romania*
XD
What if someone pays your ticket?
Flight ticket that is
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
I'm really amazed that you people don't watch porn in school... Like, for real, in Romania it's a common thing.
at school i like
lean
learn *
lol
or socialise with people
Learning? at school? a shocking thought, haven't done that in years
Am I the only person to not ever open a book and be 4th in the whole class with a straight A-?
my school has standards
and is the 4th*
you actually have to study to get good marks
My school also has standards
Same here
Everyone in my class studies
But simple physics is not hard
Caculus is easy, trigonometry is also easy
Grammar, fuck that shit
English, I guess you know the answer
we cover a lot of content in short periods of time
Same here
But internet over the years helped me
I just have to pay attention in class and I learn things
I hardly do, because the qualifications we do here are piss easy, but people still make a massive drama over them
Alright.
Server went down.
I was out most of the day.
I don't moderate this shit.
Interesting
im back
Took a shower
And I still can't believe the watching porn in school thing
Viperae, i wasn't here, go on.
09:51 <TheBrokenKeeper> I'm really amazed that you people don't watch porn in school... Like, for real, in Romania it's a common thing.

It's not that you are, but...
Well

Mmmhmmm
You are a bit of a dick for not wanting to help me with logs
What?
You never even asked me too..
If you go back to your old name

That's what I'm talking about
Uhm, wut
If I open a PM window from your old link, it pre-buffers the latest discussions

Come see what amazing new thing that aviv2 does!
Viperae: You wanted it...
So I'm writing Iodine in C# again!
And recording it!
Why?
I don't know, I feel more productive in C#. I guess the main reason is so I can easily integrate it in .NET stuff. C++ Iodine works, but I'm getting bored of writing C++, but I don't want to give up the project
Nullz wants me to upload more stuff to my channel, so I'll be making another timelapse thing
Awesome!
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died
We started singing
Bye, bye miss american pie
Drove my chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die; this'll be the day that I die.

I facebook stalked a cute guy

I think so
Yay :D
From monday in a week I'd like it to be finished
OK!
so the 29th?
Yeah
But if you can finish it any time sooner, it would be great
ok
And maybe give me a prototype for Tuesday

I hate pretending to be happy when I'm fucking unhappy. :/
I know exactly how that feels...
I have to do that daily
Yeah ikr..
Why do I want to learn German?
Like, I really want to learn it, but all online lessons are shit
They only teach you how to talk in public, how to order something, but not how to have a conversation with someone
TheBrokenKeeper learning German using an online course is not easy..
You will learn the words, but not the stuff like der/die/das and proper syntax
That's the problem
The best way to learn it is probably to live in Germany or to take a local course that's more in-depth
No, the problem is that you won't learn the words, only pre-made sentences
Example: Can I have a drink?
You should take a look at memrise
But...
There are some very good courses
It's wierd
Nah it isn't
It really helps
It has sound
Yeah that's really helpful.
You hear how a word is pronounced everytime
Or not, when you have family near you and no headsets
Did you know that it is possible to adjust the volume?
:D
wow
I never knew that!
For all 14 years of daily PC use, I never knew that you could do that
Wow!
I hope you know I'm joking, right?
No you aren't

Aviv bots only come in multiples of 2
I am going to make Aviv2 better now
Viperae: what are you doing atm?
Hwllo
Hello
ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGH
My work on Descant has been lost because everything exploded.
So the notification system will be delayed slightly.
PING
By the way, TheBrokenKeeper or Viperae, can you drop my nickserv registration?
I've lost the password to it.
And kill Aurora01, please.
Aurora01: would you like to meet the second worst IRC bot ever?
Yeah
Is it JacoBot?
Nope
It's Aviv2
According to TTK's she's better than JacoBot
So therefore second worst
Aurora01 did you fuck your computer up?
Windows Update killed it
They send a bad update
Which practically bricked it
So I had to reinstall everything
But windows is the best..
15:24 -NickServ (NickServ@services.int0x10.com)- The nickname Aurora01 belongs to a services operator; it cannot be dropped.
Wow...
Damn
spooky
I'd SSH into the server and make one, but I'm kind of recording right now and don't want to disclose anything sensitive.
I'll do it then in a few minutes
Ok
You're recording?
Yes, I'm recording a timelapse. I'm rewriting Iodine in C#
Neat-o!
Viperae, you need to make it good enough so I can write IoDjango
Or [insert witty name for it here]
xD
I would think that your recorder would have a pause button
but ok
For some reason, Windows never asked for a product key when I installed.
xD
Hmm
Sounds
fishy?
I'm using recordmydesktop. which is command line
Wow...
I'm sure there's a way to pause it, but I don't know how to. I do Control C which sends SigInt, which then makes it render the video. It takes forever to render
Aurora01: Soo... Thanks for pointing out that the latest Winblows update wrecks your computer
Hahaha
Windows
I'll not update then XD
Nothing compares to the live updates in Kernel 4.x
To be fair, I think I broke it weeks ago, but since Windows always just hibernates, it didn't show itself as an error.
Interesting
Until I restarted
Also, Dropbox is good for storing passwords and such
Maybe a KeePass file on it or something
Yeah, just store them in text files.
Remember to put them in public places so you don't forget the URL.
True, very true. Plaintext out in the open is the latest place anyone would lookj
look*
And that's kinda true. Like, if something's in front of you, you won't notice it until it's too late
Basically, I've lost my safe-mail.net email now, since they don't allow password resets.
I can't find my oper password or nickserv password
Wow...
That must suck a lot...
Oh wait, I've just realised that I can't access the Descant server now.
Even better...
Since that's linked to my safe-mail account
Which is, rather conveniently, dead.
You sure a full reinstall was a good choice?
It was the only choice
It was boot looping
Live CD?
Linux?
It can read Windows file systems
Well, I only had my recovery USB stick
Go to a friend's house, burn a live CD?
Oh wait.
For some reason, Windows has found my user folder
So I can get everything back
hOORAY
AWESOME!
Oh, and I also found all my work on Descant
Even better
Essentially, I still have *everything*
Without the issues.
Good :D
This is an awesome documentary http://www.3sat.de/mediathek/?mode=play&obj=51513
Welcome back, Aviv.
No! windows is gooooooooooooooooood
I'm going to install any uninstalled updates now
Well, burn a repair disk first :P
Nope!
Just because I think windows is that good
Don't blame me then when the inevitable happens
http://i.imgur.com/ajraaS5.png hmm or not
Interesting
Is there anyone here who actually enables windows update?
Me
Anyway the support says I have to wait
Woo windows!
Eww Micro$aft Winblows
*Micro$haft
Viperae: Don't steal without credit...
wut
I made Micro$haft...
cNo
*No
Yes.
You didn't
You were all Micro$oft
People have been calling it it Micro$haft Winblows ever since Microsoft Winblows 98 was released
I made it up from a youtube video with a Windows 95 parody from 2001
But it was never on the IRC until I pulled it up
You sound like some PPTOSer arguing because someone is using the sane name as their PPTOS....
Right
In 97 there was a parody of Windows 95 called Microshaft Winblows
*Same
Now, Cicada 3301 woke up
Wtf is that
Wait
Did you follow my advice?
With the robotic dog and fleshlight?
And named it Cicada 3301?
...
Viperae: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicada_3301
Why don't any of you guys know about these things...
IDK
Like, splitty didn't know about A858
Vippy doesn't know about Cicada 3301
Oh wow
Could be NSA
It's not the NSA
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microshaft_Winblows_98 yay!
It's been happening for a long time
No one knows...
People have been decoding Cicada 3301 messages, sorta, hardly
TheBrokenKeeper: The NSA isn't a new thing...
I know
Now, do you at least know about a858?
Nooo
No
Oh you linked to that yesterday
Viperae: These are some Cicada 3301 messages: http://uncovering-cicada.wikia.com/wiki/Category:May_2014_Runes
Yes
Viperidae, here is the transcription: http://sprunge.us/ePKL
Interesting
Viperae: Trnasliteration: https://titanpad.com/y1l0E8t6fh
Look at the last transliterated page
It makes perfect sense
banned!
http://www.reddit.com/r/cicada/comments/2ruala/status_of_cicada_2015/
This is probably some government agency
I'd love to work for the NSA
Right
Viperae: can you ban Aviv4 too?
Or basically any cool three letter agency.
Thanks
Is Aviv4 made in VB?
No, PHP still
Viperae: Nobody knows
But people who followed the 2012 one, the end linked to a location somewhere on the planet
I didn't say it was, I said it's probably a government agency. That makes the most sense.
Aviv4 will die now
Aviv4 was a failed project
And those people, I'm not sure, they are either rich now, or missing
I forgot which one XD
But why the fuck am I the only one to know about these cool things?
Viperae: http://uncovering-cicada.wikia.com/wiki/Uncovering_Cicada_Wiki
I've already come across this
Well, I've got to go now.
`die(Aurora01)
GOODNIGHT
NSA is awesome.
#FightTerrorismOrDieTryin
Let's just... Privacy is better than being spied upon.
Writing malware to take over powerplants though sounds like so much fun!
Viperae: Origin:
‚Ä¢ Established initially organized by a group of professional military officers, diplomats, and academics who were dissatisfied with the direction of the world
‚Ä¢ The organization is in no way linked to any military, or the government of any country. However, they recruit often among high government officials to gain more power
This is Cicada 3301
I'd do anything to get on the team that designed stuxnet, regin, flame, ect
And it looks like they've existed for a long ass time
Source? And according to Wikipedia they first appeared in January 4, 2012,
*on
http://pastebin.com/dHJ6JNkr
Taken from here: http://uncovering-cicada.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ
Is this digitally signed?
No
It's a random pastebin
Not credible, according to Wikipedia they sign all their shit with their private PGP key
Oh yeah
*yay
it does seem though if this email is credible they represent the hacker culture
Do you believe that information should be free?
IKR
you're too cool TheBrokenKeeper
Information should be free
Totally
But, work should not be free
unless Viperae should not say so'
Oh god, here we go
For fucks sake, no one says work should be free
That's communism.
I won't start the same thing as last night
If you think that proprietary software should be protected by law, then you do not think information should be free.
You know what's funny?
Richard Stallman, a professional programmer made money and was paid to program by big companies. The software he was developing was free software
Information as in knowledge should be free
That includes programs
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-free.en.html
Information as in bear should be paid
Viperae knows about the bear..
Don't you, honey bunny?
:|
Aviv is right
as per usual
:) <3
omg amazing http://fab-top.com/
Why the heck do I want us to start something like Cicada 3301
Don't know
Aviv, that is truly amazing!
yeah
Aviv Does Fabtop Still Occasionally Type Like This
Viperaerae, wanna think about something like this? Tomorrow, with Aurora, Splitty and bacon all at once?
No, Viperae
Why Did He Do That To Begin With
It Is So Annoying
https://www.spigotmc.org/members/chearful.54322/
TBK: If you guys can come up with something creative, I think I don't think any of us could come up with anything for geniuses though
What'ya talkin' 'bout, Viperae?
lulz turn Vulcan botnet on his MC server
oh god
I wonder if Reagan would kill me if I did that
Well, you know, not for geniuses, but, for smart-ish people
We can hide things in plain sight, learn criptography, stenography, so on and so forth
This server is home hosted. Please keep all server side activities to a minimum - Actual broadcast on Chearfulcraft

We could make riddles with how we encrypt text in images
I don't have enough knowledge to create something more advanced

Aviv: Who learned what?
That said
When will you (formal) learn it?
Wow
Google translate sucks balls then
It does
When did you learn ? <-- Google Translate 2015
3/3 of the other translators I used got it right
Although one said When will he learn it, but that's technically still right
because you formal can also be he or she
after looking at http://www.spanishdict.com/conjugate/aprender too, I have no idea where google got when did
No tengo idea donde Google consigui√≥ did
Let's just use a language that we all understand...
Japanese for example
ÔøΩ?ÔøΩ„ÇìÔøΩ?ÔøΩÔøΩ?ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ?
I don't
Let's all use Romanian
De≈£inƒÉtor rupt nu este rupt, deoarece el este minunat
Well?
That's as broken as it can get...
Let's just Japanese it up...
ÂΩºÔøΩ?ÔøΩÁ¥†Êô¥„ÇâÔøΩ?ÔøΩÔøΩ?ÔøΩÔøΩ?ÔøΩÔøΩ?ÔøΩÔøΩ?ÔøΩÔøΩ?ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ?Â£ä„ÇåÔøΩ?ÔøΩ„Ç≠„Éº„Éë„ÉºÔøΩ?ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ?Â£ä„ÇåÔøΩ?ÔøΩÔøΩ?ÔøΩÔøΩ?ÔøΩÔøΩ?ÔøΩ„ÇìÔøΩÔøΩ?

When I tell bing that your Japanese is korean, this is what it comes up with: ÂΩº ha ra shi i no has de su clear de ta ki re „Éº „Éº pa ha, self-destruction, i ma te re se nn self-destruction!
WHERE IS IT GETTING SELF DESTRUCTION
Â£ä -> Self destruction in Koreananese?
Never...
Korean doesn't even use that writing system
It uses Hangul
Well
„ÖóÎ¨¥ÌòÄ„Ö£
That was a pretty unsuccessful session
.
lol bing is just being funny
„Ö†Î¨¥Î≠Ñ

That was Hangul and banana in Korean
Wait
One sec
I fucked it up...
ok
But notpe
Microsoft's Korean input system sucks ass...
One sec...
Yup
It's very broken
Japanese works perfectly with Microsft IME
YAY
I managed to install twisted.
For what version of Python?
Viperae: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTFa6dwCEiA
splitty_: You know Cicada 3301?
Yes
Uhm TheBrokenKeeper?
Me?
I am trying to write a irc bot in python 3
I installed Twisted using pip
Twisted for Python 3 is broken
wut
really?
Also, Viperae didn't know about Cicada 3301
And yes, really
Aurora had to use Python 2 for ChatterPy
Like I was supposed too..
You were...
Don't you live on this planet?
No, I wasn't :P
It was all over the internet a few years ago
Says the same person who said everyone in the world watches pr0nz in class xD
Normal people do...
dafuq
Splitty_: Do normal people watch pr0nz in class?
At school
With their friends
No. xD
^
Exactly.
I said girls...
Normal people don't watch porn with their friends. xD
Not guys
Only girls
Why should you watch porn with a girl
right splitty_
Just have real sex with her
But TheBrokenKeeper is special
Feels better than porn
Splitty_: When you were in high school did guys watch pr0nz with girls?
No. xD
You people are old...
You're old too, TheBrokenKeeper!
I swear to god if anyone does that at my school I'll be the first person to drop!
I'm 16... Yes, I'm old
splitty_: Now, why the heck didn't Vippy know about Cicada 3301?
And splitty_'s right, who the hell watches pr0nz with girls?
I have no idea, TBK
I'd do alot more than watch pr0nz with a girl, unless she's a fucked up girl who has my sort of humor and would watch shock videos with me; but I wouldn't call that porn (Unless you are sick in the head0
*)
Cicada 3301 was everywhere a 2012/13/14 :D
remove the a
I know
The future... is in the past!
I'm amazed that Vippy didn't know about it...
Me too
Viperae: knows everything
splitty_: People are either idiots or can't see things...
even more than everything
So I'm an idiot because I don't pay attention to reddit/4chan/x for strange crypto contests..
Right
http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/uncovering-cicada/images/1/18/6.jpg
http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/uncovering-cicada/images/1/1a/Testout.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130107123015
Not that
Take a look at that...
It's solvable
Splitty_, TheBrokenKeeper: Remember those Anti-OCA people who kept sending us weird messages?
I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sdlgv4E75w
I do now
Yeah, they had strange messages and some sort of weird character set
That looks like plain old simple Greek characters
That isn't greek :|
Interesting then
I saw the delta symbol XD

*there
oh lol
that's middie
he does that
You know, the more and more I think about it; the more Middie deserved everything that has happened to him and Midtown OS
Really now?
Oh yay this is getting recorded
Yes, he seems like a little fuckwit
Actually, it isn't anymore
But he's still a fuckwit
oh ok
Good
wouldn't want to watch Iodine and see that dora image again
^
Yeah
lol
you could always edit it out though
anyway
Is it like rendering?
Yeah, I record in like hour long intervals
Then stop and let it render
TheBrokenKeeper
Are you here?
oh ok Viperae
Yes
I switched to Python 2 and recompiled Twisted. Everything looks fine now. But for some reason, I can't call connectTcp, run or stop on twisted.internet.reactor
Weird
Maybe just get rid of Python and use PHP
Nah
Dunno
Now, GET YOUR ASS ON PM NOW!
PHP is a lot faster with version 7!
Python is even faster
Oohhhohoho is it?
I think NOT
Actually
I'd bet PHP is faster
Zend uses a JIT compiler, right?
Oh wait
It does with 7
no it doesn't
Oh, well
5 does not
6 was derp
Hiphop is definitely faster than Python xD
7 will jit!!!
PHP 7 is 2x faster than 5 I think I read
chart on the state of phpng as of this month, presented at the conference, had the technology producing a 35 percent speedup on synthetic tests; 20 to 70 percent performance improvements on real applications, including a 60 percent improvement on WordPress home pages, and better memory consumption for most useful server APIs.
PHP fOREVER!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OL8LREmbDi0 This is a wonderful performance
nope
ok
so
what's new everyone?
Not a lot
WHY NOT AUGGY
DO SOMETHING INTERESTING!
Please!
Auggy
Vippy
It's no biggie
kk?
Who is this 'Auggy'
T√∫
I know an Augment, but no 'Auggy'
PHPForever: Use normal 'u' and you get the Romanian word for 'you'
Weird
Ok TheBrokenKeeper
S√≠
Use the normal 'i' and you get the Italian word for 'yes'
and remove the s and the √≠ and add a d and an a and you get the Romanian word for yes
and change the d to a j and you get the german word for yes
amazing!
Wat?
English is the official language of int0x10
No more speaking mexican
We don't speak wetback here
Inca putem vorbi limba romana, nu?
Romanian is acceptable.
Mexican is not
Yay :D

No?
I wanted you to ban it from #int0x10 :D

Dead, lol. You know I got back with Courtney for like 4 days then I was like Yeah, this is not going to work. Had some mad sex though. Btw this is being recorded (I'm filming a time lapse) so.... Hopefully IRC conversations will literally be only a split second in the video and I won't have to edit this out

So Syrup was just commenting on how much he loves Viperae!
wut
Viperae: why don't you ask Syrup for his religious views?
lolw0t
Uhm, like I said I'm kind of recording a time lapse of me writing an interpreter; so starting a classic int0x10 debate might not be appropriate?
aww
but Syrup!
Well then
Yeah pres is fun
next time maybe
BYE
So there was like 200 ants in my trash can
DAyum
Ok, so I'm like almost half way done with the time lapse

I don't think he looked in this channel
Thank god
Apparently I'm not the most experienced programmer in their group :(
I highly, extremely, to the absolute max, doubt that.

I'm going to reveal myself
Hahahaha, this is getting good
xD
did you record all of this?
It's logged on Skype
God damn Power went out
ah
so howd it go
howd they react
It wasn't as dramatic as I hoped
Send logs?
Can't
I'd have to get on Skype again
I'll do it tomorrow
But I told them I was going to go
Alright
Did they get mad?
no
Firefox doesn't use OSX keyboard shortcuts

There
I like the last one
.
Hey Aurora01
I'm writing a bot in Python2 using Twisted
But I'm having a few problems
Hmm, what's the issue?
I can't join the channel #splittys_witness
What's the error message?
There is no error message.
Code please
The bot joins but it just doesn't join the channel.
Have you tried Turing it on and off again?
I'll leave.
:D
Code please
:P
http://pastebin.com/txM1HH7r
Move self.join to connectionMade
It's weird. The bot loses connection every few seconds
Lost connection ([Failure instance: Traceback (failure with no frames): <class 'twisted.internet.error.ConnectionDone'>: Connection was closed cleanly.
]), reconnecting.
I have the following code in my connectionMade override:
for chan in str(self.factory.channels).split(','):
self.join(chan)
The channels are in the format #channel1,#channel2
You should store them in JSON
I tried printing the channel names and it looks like it's working
It's much easier
Yeah I'll do that later. But it should work anyway.
However, that isn't the issue.
I don't get why the bot is disconnecting every 3 or 4 seconds
Does it enter the network at all?
It joined #int0x10 before TBK banned it from this channel
Try it again now
Weird.
It joined before.
Perhaps there's something wrong with your nickname generation
Try hardcoding it
I hardcoded the nickname 'witty'
It says that it's joining #int0x10 and #splittys_witness
Hardcode it in the WittyBot class
Do I have to define a key or something?
For the channe√∂
channel*
Nope
It's not even connecting to this channel, so there's a bigger issue
You don't have to handle the ping event by the way
Oh, I know the issue
def ping(self, user, text=None):
self.ping(user, text)
That's just infinite looping
Until eventually the twisted reactor gives up
oh
I removed it. The signedOn override doesn't get called
Didn't change anything
Are you trying to connect now?
Yes
It says connected to server but it doesn't call signedOn
Well, I can't see you connecting
Override the rawDataReceived function
https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/8.2.0/api/twisted.protocols.basic.LineReceiver.html#rawDataReceived
In fact, no
Just the dataReceived function
https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/8.2.0/api/twisted.words.protocols.irc.IRCClient.html#dataReceived
Do something like this
def dataReceived(self, data):
print(data)
Nothing.
super(self, irc.IRCClient).dataReceived(data)
splitty_, do you mean it's not printing anything?
Oh
there are lots of errors
That may have been helpful to know.
:P
:irc.int0x10.com NOTICE Auth :*** Looking up your hostname...
:irc.int0x10.com NOTICE Auth :*** Could not resolve your hostname: Domain name not found; using your IP address (109.75.92.228) instead.
After that, just errors.
Well there were no errors before.
What sort of errors?
The error is super(self, irc.IRCClient).dataReceived(data) -> exceptions.TypeError: must be type, not instance
Oh, whoops, that was my fault then.
Remove that line
OOOH
Registration timeout
dafuq
That means that your client never actually sends the authentication data.
Oh, I see the issue.
You need to include irc.IRCClient.connectionMade(self) in the connectionMade function
https://gist.github.com/shnmorimoto/1717671 that might be useful for you
Oh. Interesting.
Do I have to upcall on every method I'm overriding?
No
Just the connectionMade and connectionLost
oh okay
Thank you
Can you ban witty again please?
What's the channel for the bot?

Hey watchmee
Wow
That's a watchmee...
G'day
Ichiru lied to me! They do use G'day
xD I think it's more ironic now because foreigners expect it
G'day watchmee.

How's shazza?
Awww yeah, she's just down at the pub avin a few scooners
Got her Centrelink, just like Bazza?
Yeah mate, but bazza still on his compo so he's good for a shout
(Typical Australian conversation)
I saw him at the traino this arvo.
He was heading to maccas with Shazza.
Puarrr, she's cruisin for root
She's just looking for a mate, mate.
Maaaaate
Wanna come over for a breaky, vegemite toast and even cheese toasties, then maybe head down to Bunnings for a sausage sizzle.
Ah yeah, sounds mint
Uhm
Aurora01
I don't get inheritance. xD
Why not?
I made a class called PluginBase with a function msg(self,user,channel,msg)
It's so easy in python
And then a plugin called EchoPlugin(PluginBase) that orrivdes msg
Yeah?
When I try to instantiate the EchoPlugin, it says TypeError: Error when calling the metaclass bases
module.__init__() takes at most 2 arguments (3 given)
I don't get it.
Code?
Did you forget to include self as a function parameter?
Wut
no
PluginBase: http://pastebin.com/68ttpSci
EchoPlugin: http://pastebin.com/zsiMrsnq
Witty: http://pastebin.com/zX3SpDLM
Ignore the first import at the top of the file, I removed it.
In Python 2, make sure your classes inherit from object.
Yup
That could potentially be the issue
Changed PluginBase to inherit from object. Didn't change anything.
Python is so weird
Wow, for some reason I still can't understand Python code written by someone else
I can understand my code perfectly
But this is alien language
Or wait
I know why
Look at my nick...
I can't focus
splitty_, try this
from witty.plugins.PluginBase import PluginBase
I assume that your file is called PluginBase.py, right?
Yeah
Basically, what you've accidentally done is tried to inherit from the PluginBase module, rather than the class.
And then, things start to break.
wow..
Why is this even possible in Python lol
Dynamicness.
Okay just one more question
Call to __init__ of super class is missed
How can I call the constructor of the super class?
super() doesn't work, it wants 2 types
super.__init__ doesn't work either
super(self, Class).__init__()
TypeError: must be type, not EchoPlugin
super(Class, self).__init__()
Whoops
ohyay
:P
Descant notifications are pretty much done
Now to implement the PM sending form
I'll send Tony Abbott once done.
Sadly, they'll turn the boat around.
I love how my laptop overheats after 25 hours of being turned on
I love how ironic it is that laptops aren't suited for being used on non-flat surfaces and soft materials.
Like, pants.

Haribo's MAOAM candy criticised for 'sexual' sweet wrappers
Joystixx <3
MAOAMs cause me tooth pain xD
Yeah they make me dislocate my jaw (like most of my other favourite sweets) but so worth it
xD
Well, technically it only makes me subluxate my jaw
Haribo MAOAM sour candies feature 'fruits in pornographic poses'
But enough that I have to force the fucking thing back in with my hands and endure the awful crunching sound as it pops back in
Where do I buy some?
Any major supermarket... In the UK and maybe the US, idk about elsewhere
Amazon apparently.
That too

I still have to zoom
Are you on the bootswatch theme?

Do you like the new feature, ThePhoneKeeper?
It's nice
I want to write a neural network
splitty_, you here?
Aurora01, are you here?
Yes.
How would memory in a neural network work?
I
I'm thinking about something like a reccursive system
But then how to get things out?
I don't know, take a look at PyBrain or something
I don't think it has memory
As it's a simple neural network
If you want long short term memory, you need to implement it yourself
PyBrain has an emphasis on network architectures, which can be trained and manipulated with almost all of the algorithms offered by PyBrain. Here are some examples of available networks and network architectures:
Feed-forward networks, including Deep Belief Networks and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM)
Recurrent networks (RNN), including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures
Interesting
But I want to implement something in C#
And I can't seem to be able to understand Python
I found a nice design of an LSTM cell
Wair
Wait*
I still don't understand how it works
maths mmkay
:P
Alright, I've never heard of PyBrain, will have a play with.

Thank you for your report. It has been processed by me, Aviv, and not Aurora01.
Goodbye.
Check your PMs, splitty_.
You have to use the Bootswatch theme to see them.

Heya
Hello, Emily.
Would you like to test some revolutionary new forum software developed by me?
splitty_, are you still working on the Material Theme?
Aurora01 yes, kind of.
Cool
I am trying to finish it in the next 2 weeks
You'll have to implement the notifications and other things that I've added since you started making it
However, I'm hoping to release Descant v0.2 in the near future, so you may as well target that for your theme.
Otherwise the API will keep changing
Aurora01, bug spotted
Where?
Oh
Nevermind
What was it?
The (1) next to the bell still showed up after I read Aviv's message.
But it now vanished. Probably took a few seconds to update
Yeah, it updates every 60 seconds
nice
btw, can you make it so that it updates when a post was posted/edited?
I need to refresh everytime I post something or edit a post
It should do it automatically
It refreshes for replies
Ah, not for topics
I see.
I will fix it

what?
U foken wot
I need your opinion
nikxda thinks my website is ugly, and he is a talented web designer.
http://splitty.de/
Please be objective.
Is this website ugly? If not, is there anything that is an absolute no-go for you?
To be fair, since it's so minimal, I don't think it can really be called ugly
I tried to keep it clean and simple and provide all the relevant information
Basically what Aurora01 said... It's not ugly but there's not really enough there for it to be anything much
It doesn't fall into my category of ugly. But it's too minimal, it does not scale nicely on my small resolution, so on and so forth
Okay thx
Basically, too much empty space
I could add some adverts
jk :D
Host a Descant forum there
:P
xD
ahahaha
add in a load of banner adverts
abuse Google Adsense

And then get banned
:P

BAN ALL ADS!!!
Does nobody remember the Monkey Island series? Nobody at all? ;-;
I remember a game called Secrets of the Monket Island
And it's theme song
But that's it
Don't you just mean The Secret of Monkey Island?
Okay, okay...
I have never played it
http://store.steampowered.com/app/32360/
Only seen things
Classic point 'n' click adventure
Yes
The best one is #3, The Curse of Monkey Island, but there's no special edition of that
But this is the remastered version
Aye but you can switch back to classic version at any point, it's a bit like Halo Anniversary in that regard
Cameron: Original: http://199.101.98.242/media/images/96023-The_Secret_of_Monkey_Island_(CD_DOS_VGA)-5.jpg
Interesting
Well, I can't buy any more games
Indeed I remember the original
Cameron: This game is 9 years older than me
Amazing
Yup it's pretty old
The first one I played was Curse of Monkey Island

Hi!
Hello Aviv!
Hello TheBrokenLogKeeper!
Hello, Aviv.
Soo... Will you be able to provide me with a small prototype for my website in 26-28 hours at most?
Let's see!
TheBrokenLogKeeper, just create a quick bootstrap thing if you're in a rush
Super fast PHP time!
Aurora01, I need to show working things unfortunatelly
Or remove an l from unfortunatelly, forgot how it's right
Well, spend 1-2 hours making a quick bootstrap UI, and 1-2 hours with Django
I have spelling issues like those since ~10 years ago
Oh, and Aviv, when you get time, please add the notifications and PM templates for your theme.
It's done in the backend, and testable with the Bootswatch theme on the server
ok
Django ha!
You can do stuff much more quickly with Django
Sure
Aurora01, I cannot focus on anything currently
My nick should very much point that out
Well, don't leave stuff to the last second then
You've known that this project was needed for ages
I'm very much in a fucking fuck my mother fucking life state
Aviv said he can do it xD
I just need a prototype for now
Wow
Aviv has one more week of work
why are you Fuck my life
Yes, but Aviv is needed for Descant.
:P
He has enough time
wut

Why're you logging my life, Cameron?
BRB now y'all
I'm not logging your life, TheBrokenLogKeeper is... Well he was before he changed his name
Oh
oh okay
How're you/who are you?
I AM CAMERON AND I AM GOOD THANK YOU
I am always logging
I'll give you the rundown: weird English 17-year-old from outer space who likes typing in all-caps. That's all anyone needs to know
Oh and Fall Out Boy and bacon
It's Cameroon, now.
<3 bacon <3
Me or actual bacon? 'cause I have no bacon.
Both
You are actual bacon, bacon <3
I feed that lie to people.
They eat it up like... bacon
Quite frankly I think you're being racist
YOU MONSTERS MADE ME HUNGRY FOR BACON
I had bacon for lunch. And MAOAM. Remember? Remember me creaming over my lunch?
Fuck you
Was your name always TheBrokenKeeper or is it just that because you're broken at the moment?
Cameron, I am a bigoted bacon, when am I never racist?
Okay then
My normal name is TheTimeKeeper
Or Chronium
But I'm very broken at the moment... Like, yeah...
And it's nothing related to having a leg in a cast
Life story
Which nobody will disclose here.
THETIMEKEEPER OHHHHH OF COURSE
lol
Really...
Fucking really...
lollllllll
And Chronium I think I knew that one first
It's not like I told you a dozen of times that I'm Chronium...

It's a terrible idea to pipe instructions from IRC to a terminal
Especially a privileged one
(irc over cat)
It's the best idea!
Like, what could go wrong?
TheBrokenKeeper, do you want to access God Mode on Linux?
Well, if  by that you mean root access on the VPS then by all means, show me how to do it
Open up a terminal screen
Don't have any
I'm sorta very much on Windows right now xD
cygwin
I don't have black magic
Open up a Windows terminal then
But I do have the MinGW that came with the Git Bash
You're on Windows? I know how to get God mode on there
Just use a normal windows command prompt
Just delete System32
%0|%0
Git Bash then
Just type that
In the Command Prompt
Powershell?
Probably would work

But it wasn't close to frozen
It was running perfectly
I was testing your 6GB RAM, let's say
It was working perfectly still, chrome worked, YouTube worked, Smuxi did
Well, fuck you too Aurora01
What?
It's not like you fucking made my laptop open 65 command prompts
But I'm amazed that it still ran fine
Like, really, everything was perfectly running
Well, I was stress testing it for you

Well
I'm forced to use Eclipse
over Intelij
:(
Why?
Because, Intelij isn't cooperating with Forge. I can just use the IDE and build from the command line; but that takes forever. Basically, Intelij works; except it doesn't build resources for some reason
Viperidae: You are crazy, right?

There
Boom
Uhm...
You *REALLY* think I'm that stupid and didn't create my idea workspace?
I already made a workspace and project with forge gradlew, and it builds just fine
What's the problem?
The resources don't build.
That's weird
I always used IntelliJ
And it worked perfectly
Like, no problem what so ever
Viperidae: Did you follow something like this? http://www.minecraftforge.net/wiki/Forge_Development_in_IntelliJ_IDEA
Yes... of course
I like Eclipse more though
That's really weird

witty, we need your wisdom
A christian could say that gold is proof that God exists. As we haven't yet managed to synthesize any gold out of anything, so where did it come from?
Share your wisdom with us
There's no place like your homepage.
wisdom!!!?!?!?

TheBrokenKeeper I think I'll go with Markov Chains
no don't
I don't know anything about how language processing works, you do whatever you feel is best
k
TheBrokenKeeper, Markov chains are really interesting
Right
A Markov chain is a random process that undergoes transitions from one state to another on a state space. It must possess a property that is usually characterized as memoryless: the probability distribution of the next state depends only on the current state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it. This specific kind of memorylessness is called the Markov property. Markov chains have many applications as statistical models of real-world
processes.
But I'll use a continous-time markov chain.
Right
I once wanted to make a quantum computer based simulation of a 3*3*3 qubit matrix of all possible states in that matrix
But 27 qubits eat a lot of RAM to simulate
And then make something along the lines of changing something and viewing changes down the road
But it was impossible to make, I was too lazy to learn all the quantum math required for that
That's a shame
Objection: A Markov chain is not a neural net, and it won't follow syntactic structures and therefore won't produce syntactically valid English 99.99999 percent of the time
(I may or may not have pulled that statistic out of my ass, but... *shrugs*
Aviv: Don't forget
In 24 hours I'd like a prototype
¬°Claro que s√≠!
_prototype_
right...
what do you even mean by that?
I have no idea
Just make something that works
You'll have one more week to refine it
But I need something to show in two days
Let's say a day and 12 hours

1:1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
1:2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
1:3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
1:4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.
1:5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
1:6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
1:7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
1:8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.
1:9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
1:10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
1:11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
1:12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
1:13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.
1:14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: 1:15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
1:16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
1:17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, 1:18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
1:19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
1:20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.
1:21 And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
1:22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
1:23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
1:24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
1:25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
1:28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
1:29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
1:30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
1:31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.
2:1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
2:2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
2:3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.
2:4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens, 2:5 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.
2:6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
2:7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
2:8 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
2:9 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
2:10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.
2:11 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; 2:12 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.
2:13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.
2:14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.
2:15 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.
_mute
2:16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: 2:17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.
2:18 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.
2:19 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.
2:20 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.
2:21 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; 2:22 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.
2:23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.
2:24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.
2:25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
3:1 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? 3:2 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: 3:3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
3:4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: 3:5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
3:6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
3:7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
3:8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.
3:9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou? 3:10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
3:11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat? 3:12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
3:13 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
3:14 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: 3:15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
3:16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
3:17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; 3:18 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; 3:19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto
the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
3:20 And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.
3:21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
3:22 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: 3:23 Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
3:24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.
4:1 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.
4:2 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
4:3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.
4:4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering: 4:5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.
4:6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? 4:7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.
4:8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.
4:9 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper? 4:10 And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.
4:11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand; 4:12 When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.

4:13 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear.
4:14 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.
4:15 And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.
4:16 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.
4:17 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.
4:18 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.
4:19 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
4:20 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle.
4:21 And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.
4:22 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.
4:23 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.
4:24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.
Viperidae, I muted it. It will still save all the stuff you're posting.
4:25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.
4:26 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.
5:1 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him; 5:2 Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.
5:3 And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, and after his image; and called his name Seth: 5:4 And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters: 5:5 And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.
5:6 And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos: 5:7 And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:8 And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died.
5:9 And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan: 5:10 And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:11 And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and he died.
5:12 And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel: 5:13 And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:14 And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died.
5:15 And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared: 5:16 And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:17 And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died.
5:18 And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch: 5:19 And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:20 And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died.
5:21 And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah: 5:22 And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:23 And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years: 5:24 And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.
5:25 And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech.
5:26 And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:27 And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.
5:28 And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son: 5:29 And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed.
5:30 And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:31 And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died.
5:32 And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
6:1 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, 6:2 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
6:3 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
6:4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
6:5 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6:6 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
6:7 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
6:8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.
6:9 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
6:10 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
6:11 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.
6:12 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
6:13 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
6:14 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
6:15 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
6:16 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
6:17 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
6:18 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
6:19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
6:20 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
6:21 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.
6:22 Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.
7:1 And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.
7:2 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female.
7:3 Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.
7:4 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.
7:5 And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.
7:6 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.
7:7 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
\nI fucked my dog last week and now i think its pregnant\n4chan is for little children.\n
7:8 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth, 7:9 There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah.
7:10 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.
7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.
7:12 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
7:13 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark; 7:14 They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.
7:15 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life.
7:16 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.
7:17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
7:18 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
7:19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
7:20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.
7:21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man: 7:22 All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.
7:23 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.
7:24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.
8:1 And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged; 8:2 The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained; 8:3 And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.
8:4 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.
8:5 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.
8:6 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made: 8:7 And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.
8:8 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground; 8:9 But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.
8:10 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark; 8:11 And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
8:12 And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.
4chan,
8:13 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
8:14 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.
8:15 And God spake unto Noah, saying, 8:16 Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.
8:17 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.
8:18 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him: 8:19 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.
8:20 And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
8:21 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.
8:22 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.
9:1 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.
9:2 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
9:3 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.
9:4 But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.
9:5 And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
9:6 Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.
9:7 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.
9:8 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, 9:9 And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you; 9:10 And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
9:11 And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
9:12 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: 9:13 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.
9:14 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: 9:15 And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
9:16 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
9:17 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.
9:18 And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.
9:19 These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.
9:20 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard: 9:21 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.
9:22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.
9:23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.
9:24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.
9:25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.
9:26 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.
9:27 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.
9:28 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
9:29 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.
10:1 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.
10:2 The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.
10:3 And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.
10:4 And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
10:5 By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.
10:6 And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.
I tihnk you crashed

hi
17:20 He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.
17:21 He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy.
17:22 A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones.
17:23 A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment.
17:24 Wisdom is before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth.
17:25 A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him.
17:26 Also to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for equity.
17:27 He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.
17:28 Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.
18:1 Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom.
18:2 A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.
18:3 When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach.
18:4 The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters, and the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook.
18:5 It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment.
18:6 A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes.
18:7 A fool's mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of his soul.
18:8 The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.
18:9 He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.
18:10 The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.
18:11 The rich man's wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit.
18:12 Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is humility.
18:13 He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him.
18:14 The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear? 18:15 The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.
18:16 A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.
18:17 He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.
18:18 The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty.
18:19 A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and their contentions are like the bars of a castle.
18:20 A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.
18:21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.
18:22 Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD.
18:23 The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.
18:24 A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.
19:1 Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool.
19:2 Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good; and he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.
19:3 The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the LORD.
19:4 Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour.
19:5 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall not escape.
19:6 Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts.
19:7 All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to him.
19:8 He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good.
19:9 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall perish.
19:10 Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes.
19:11 The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and it is his glory to pass over a transgression.
19:12 The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour is as dew upon the grass.
19:13 A foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.
19:14 House and riches are the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife is from the LORD.
19:15 Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.
19:16 He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; but he that despiseth his ways shall die.
19:17 He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again.
19:18 Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying.
19:19 A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver him, yet thou must do it again.
19:20 Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.
19:21 There are many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.
19:22 The desire of a man is his kindness: and a poor man is better than a liar.
19:23 The fear of the LORD tendeth to life: and he that hath it shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.
19:24 A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.
19:25 Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge.
19:26 He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.
19:27 Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge.
19:28 An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity.
19:29 Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools.
20:1 Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.
20:2 The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion: whoso provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul.
20:3 It is an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool will be meddling.
20:4 The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; therefore shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing.
20:5 Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out.
20:6 Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find? 20:7 The just man walketh in his integrity: his children are blessed after him.
20:8 A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes.
20:9 Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin? 20:10 Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them are alike abomination to the LORD.
20:11 Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure, and whether it be right.
20:12 The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them.
20:13 Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread.
20:14 It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.
20:15 There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.
20:16 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.
20:17 Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.
20:18 Every purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war.
20:19 He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets: therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.
20:20 Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.
20:21 An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed.
20:22 Say not thou, I will recompense evil; but wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee.
20:23 Divers weights are an abomination unto the LORD; and a false balance is not good.
20:24 Man's goings are of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own way? 20:25 It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy, and after vows to make enquiry.
20:26 A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them.
20:27 The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly.
20:28 Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy.
20:29 The glory of young men is their strength: and the beauty of old men is the grey head.
20:30 The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so do stripes the inward parts of the belly.
21:1 The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.
21:2 Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the LORD pondereth the hearts.
21:3 To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.
21:4 An high look, and a proud heart, and the plowing of the wicked, is sin.
21:5 The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; but of every one that is hasty only to want.
21:6 The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death.
21:7 The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment.
21:8 The way of man is froward and strange: but as for the pure, his work is right.
21:9 It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house.
21:10 The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes.
21:11 When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.
21:12 The righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked: but God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness.
21:13 Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.
21:14 A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom strong wrath.
21:15 It is joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity.
21:16 The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead.

That doesn't make any sense
Aristotle believed that all the matter in the universe was made up of four basic elements ‚Äì earth, air, fire, and water .
\These elements were acted on by two forces: gravity, the tendency for earth and water to sink, and levity, the tendency
This division of the contents of the universe into matter and forces is still used today .  Aristotle
Democritus, held that matter was inherently grainy and that everything was made up of large numbers of various different kinds of atoms .

People say to me that a person being a helicopter is Impossible and I‚Äôm fucking retarded but I don‚Äôt care, I‚Äôm beautiful. I‚Äôm having a plastic surgeon install rotary blades, 30 mm cannons and AMG-114 Hellfire missiles on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me
‚ÄúApacheÔøΩÔøΩ? and respect my right to kill from above and kill needlessly. If you can‚Äôt accept me you‚Äôre a heliphobe and need to check your vehicle privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.

I‚Äôll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I‚Äôve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I‚Äôm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has
never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I
can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that‚Äôs just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ‚ÄúcleverÔøΩÔøΩ? comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe
you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn‚Äôt, you didn‚Äôt, and now you‚Äôre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kiddo.
