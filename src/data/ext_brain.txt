I think intelligence is a form of insanity, one which is sometimes useful, but is a psychosis nonetheless.
It is really just the ability to lie and deceive others.

I find it interesting how genius and madness are two sides of the same coin. The most intelligent people always have a little crazy. I also usually see brilliance in "mentally ill" people.

MediaFire works fine, just right click the download button, and copy the link. This works because all that does is redirect you to the legitimate download.
Well, it gave me 8 pieces of adware
but yeah it's not windows' fault then
With no fucking warnings in the installer
it's your fault for downloading a program with adware...
The installer was clean, I started the CPU temperature monitor
It was installing adware live
lol then you downloaded something
Yes, I downloaded a legit CPU temperature monitoring tool that Bing was adveritising as being the best one
nooooooo
lol so you basically just clicked on an ad and you expect it to NOT HAVE ADWARE?
splitty_
Can you replace him?
Yes
Aviv, you are being annoying right now
cunt
lol you're at fault 100%

I did not click any ad...

uhm
Now, I'll be closing Smuxi, I need to get rid of adware
#scrublord
I can talk on here
Good
Take the advice of Richard Stallman
Your malware is not the CPU Temp program
Your malware is Windows
It is
Well, true
But tell that to Aviv
I have
Many times
And?
But for someone who uses windows (Aviv)
lol the adware is from CoreTemp's installer, ThePhoneKeeper
He seems to get less viruses than you
;P
Cool
This is the first time in 5 years I get adware
That's because I look things up before I download things from bing ads :)
Brb in 2 mins
kek Aviv
Aviv, my CPU was at 90C
Is that what the adware told you?
lol
:P
Exactly
ThePhoneKeeper: you could just use the built in Windows tool
What tool?
Exactly
Bing didn't tell me about a built in tool either...
Exactly there really should be one
Indeed
Also, I haven't used Windows in over 4 months
omg
So I kinda forgot how to not get adware
lol
I'm back and ad free
Just because you say that doesn't mean I'll sleep with you
I'm gonna go to sleep
Now that you got your "viruses" removed
lol Reagan xD
Goodnight [sleep]splitty_
Goodnight :)

So 29?
Aviv or Reagan, any idea on what I should program to test out Visual Studio?
no

This is fucking different
Now, let's make it how I like it to be
Get rid of all the icons!

Okay, the adware cleaner broke my web browser

Aviv: I got back my browser
Which is?
Google Crome

Reagan: Please tell me he's joking
Google Chrome is the real adware on your computer lol
About what

I don't get it

Well, looks like AndroIRC doesn't care if you put a space before the /... It will still execute it
lol
/help
oh!
You know? " /kill Viperidae die!!!"
If you put a space, it ignores it
But not on AndroIRC
So yeah
I kinda killed you, but didn't mean it...
Nullz, how's your game engine going?
Almost done with tilemap. Please note that this isn't a simple tilemap though :p
Nice
Does it have layers and such?
Yes
and multiple tilesets.
Only issue I see right now is, if one tile has 3 layers and if one layer is tilesheet 1 and the other one is tilesheet 2 itll set both layers to ether be tilesheet 1 or 2
Hi [mobile]splitty and [sleep]splitty_ and bacon and Aviv and ChanServ and bacon and ThePhoneKeeper!

*explosion*
hi Nullz
Hello.
YAY Nullz IS HERE
woo
so you still workin' on your challenge?
..what challenge?
How do you know about the challenge?
Aviv: I am going to comment it a lot so that way you can start to learn C#
OH you were talking to Reagan
Hello Reagan.
oh great Reagan
All heil!
woo
I got my Â¡done better
Â¡!Â¡!
now it works properly
Aviv your learning C#?
No!
?:/
You know..
C# is more microsoft than Visual basic..
Nullz: no
Jus tno
lol that doesn't matter to me, Nullz
*Just
C# and Visual BASIC are both completely Microsoft
Why? Look up the history of Visual Basic(well Basic at the time.) it wasn't made by microsoft.
Errrr
It was paid to be made by microsoft
The version that we have
Is made by them
VB6 has some roots in what I would call the "old basic"
Ã¡ll done
Visual Basic is still derived from Basic.
hence, the Basic part in Visual Basic
But they MUST have completely redone it to make it compile for the .NET runtime, something that wasn't around when BASIC was originally developed :P
nÃ³
yÃ¡y it is fun!
Â¿now I can do this!
C# is more of a manly language though
^
C# is more logical
And it is totally OOP
ok great
Also, reagan you know IronPython, IronRuby(and I'm sure theres another IronLanguage), NLua, and csscript? Those are all things that I can put into my application and have my application use them.
nope
I can't seem to find one for visual basic.
define "one"
What do you mean
I can't seem to find a visual basic execution engine.
All of the things above ^ are things that will allow my Game Engine to use that language.
Reagan:
how is the challenge?
Done
Oh?
Uploading a gist
k
ok
https://gist.github.com/JacobMisirian/4a9007bb30238077e3bc
aww Tel Aviv has its own namespace
Now that's not actually the most efficient way to do it
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fk49wtc1%28v=vs.110%29.aspx
does C# not even have block comments?
lol
It does
ok
I just prefer //
lol I know what switches and for loops are
But not in C#...
The syntax is different from the witch chants of VB
lol I have never used a switch in vb
PHP switches and C# switches are identical so it seems
also do you need to break on the default case?
oh ok you don't according to internet
but yeah thanks Reagan
Wait I am missing my break?
Nope
default:                                                         result += userInput[x].ToString();                                                         break;
No
I was saying you don't need to break the default
Refer to: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/06tc147t.aspx
default:         Console.WriteLine("Default case");         break;
BRB !
Hi

So what ya doing?

How about you then null z?
The same?
no
Ok
I'm looking at twitter
Wow
You should make your own twitter
In PHP!
Wow;
You like that idea
Wow;
I dotn want to learn php;
What do you know then?
See sharp?
ACTUALLY
I THINK I CAN DO THAT
HOLY SHIT
A bit of java, A little more than a bit of Python, C#(not all of it), and I want to lean C and C++
Aviv: wanna help me make something like twitter?
Rae: You'll find PHP is C# with no types and more dollar signs
Uhm ok rae
Here's my idea for the backend
The dollar signs are my favorite part of PHP lol
For now let's just ignore user signups and say that we've already got users
Perhaps a channel for this?
Each user has a file in the system containing all of their "tels" (twitter messages)
Guys we need to make it Rowan Blanchard & Sabrina Carpenter themed.
/join #tels
Guys we need to make it Rowan Blanchard & Sabrina Carpenter themed.
Why does each user have a file? Lol
That will be optional
Actually
It would likely be best for each user to have a special file
Good afternoon.
Huh

Hi
Hi ð
Fine, I lied, It's not afternoon here.
Hehe
Bye
Nullz: learning php is going...eh
http://misiriansoft.com/tel
Interesting.
Hi bacon
submitted a message.
I am doing my first webdev
Congrats, what language?
oh
PHP
Yeah
I'm an idiot, it's right there.
Haha.
lele
Can you help me with some code
Sure!
PHP was my first language
I am trying to read a file and iterate over the contents
The C# code would look like:
string[] contents = File.ReadAllLines(path);
iterate based on what?
lines
ah
for (int x = 0; x < contents.Length; x++)
{
console.Write(contents[x]);
}
That's it
Well, here's what I would do.
https://php.net/manual/en/function.fgets.php
bacon: http://pastebin.com/DeKEavkt
That's my current code
http://misiriansoft.com/tel/board.php
do this:
That just prints the one line at the top
You'll need to open a file descriptor.
$file_handle = fopen("file", xx);
Ok
xx should be the permissions.
Like
read, write.
hmmm
That's not *really* the issue
You'll only need "r"
It can read data.txt
Then you'll need to use fgets.
so
Why isn't the current one working though?
Isn't that all valid syntax
I'll have a look soon.
while(($buffer = fgets($file_handle, 4096)) !== false) {
This will read the current line and place it in a 4096-sized array.
buffer*
count.
What does count do?
Yeah.
count should get the length of the array
Yeah, I just looked it up.
Ok
is file returning false?
IDK
Oh.
Shit.
count() works
for ($x = 0; x <
I just verified that
OG
*OH
for ($x = 0; $x < count($contents);
Yeah.
yeah
+1 bacon
I just realized that.
http://misiriansoft.com/tel/data.txt
You need a new line!
I know!
how do you echo multiple strings
That "I'm not actually bacon" wasn't me, I assure you /s
echo "test" + "test"
.
echo "test"."test"
Ah
I think
It's been awhile.
Why is PHP so weird
Haha, I like some of it's syntax.
err the . didn't work
https://php.net/manual/en/language.operators.string.php
did you forget a ;?
No
YAY

Viperidae, I love your XSS.
However, I can think of a better one.
CSRF, anyone?
In what?
http://misiriansoft.com/tel/
XSS + CSRF.
spammer.
Lol
Best security eu
xDDDD
He's probably literally just putting it all into a file and echoing that out
http://misiriansoft.com/tel/data.txt
Obviously without escaping
Ah
I figured that out when the SQLi's didn't do anything (And I highly doubt Reagan is competent enough to use prepared statements)
I was hoping he was directly appending shit to board.php
Lol
That would have been SO many lulz
Never 4get Devatan.
.php3 - web developer's worst nightmare. /s
I wasn't even there, how would I remember
Haha.
It was hacked via a "file sharing" service implemented by the webserver's operator (not the owner)
Apparently someone exploited a file upload thing and defaced it?
intelloTech did yes, stole the database too.
Sqlite
Did you hear what happened to http://osnetwork.ga/ ?
Nope
.htaccess would have solved this issue though.
The database was stolen and like 6 passwords were vulnerable to dictionary attack
bacon's password is like a 30 character string.
lol
I spent 2 hours figuring out what was happening in my project and all i did was forget to set a variable in the constructor.
Done that.
It's also fun when you do a property like:
public string Name {
get { return this.Name; }
}
Overflow! :p I actually did that like two times in a row last night xD
Haha, a possible method for fixing this would be to use Visual Studio's function for creating a property, but I prefer to create it manually.
Visual studio has an option to just do it for you....
bacon, last night at 3
Fuck
Last night at 3 AM I had 81 updates to do on my Winblows
Dude omg I wasted like a whole day doing Properties for a project like 11 months ago
And couldn't get on linux to let my laptop log things, so fuck...
I am starting to really hate this OS
THEN FUCKING GET RID OF IT
God
shhhhh
Install Rainmeter
Viperidae: Go ahead and fucking play a DirectX game through Wine
It doesn't fucking work...
Yup, Nullz. I think all you need to do is right click on a field, and in the refactor submenu there's:
Normal games do, but not directx
"encapsulate ..."
http://gyazo.com/e1a6850054d61092dd1712d7fd87584b It's so beautiful.
So fucking what
bacon: My installation of Visual Studio has 18 GB
That isn't a good reason to use Windows
Not at all
TheWindowsKeeper, with WP?
What?
With Windows Phone tools, like emulators.
No
Viper soon. Soon I will have a dedicated computer to run linux.
Just the modern Win8.1 things, no phone emulators
Ah.
Ewww WP
Visual Studio 2015 has a slow compiler compared to the old ones
:/
The compiler is csc.exe :/
I know
Well 2015 isn't even completely released yet so it might get better!
But somehow, the .Net 4.6.2 version is slow as fuck
QUIT YOUR COMPLAINING
I am not complaining, I am giving my own opinion on something
If you dislike free speech, then don't advertise it with your love for GPL
Careful, Viperidae's a dictator.
The last romanian dictator was assassinated
So Viperidae should be careful about dictatorship...
He won't be assassinated because he will kill himself before that happens.
Viperidae, literally killed Viperidae, which invalidates the negative.
CHANSERV HAS BEEN OVERTHROWN
AND IN ITS PLACE, IS MY NEW EMPIRE

I'm fine.
Would you like me to register the channel?
I actually have a back problem.
Haha, Nullz.

Nullz: You know Payday 2?
Yeah? I dont have it.
The recommended settings are lower than my laptop's specs

So I can actually play some relatively good games
Awesome!!!
Viperidae: Wanna do a Skyrim race?
I can do an Oblivion speedrun faster than you can, at least

My computer most likely wont be able to run it keeper.
Thats why i dont get all the new games
That's why I have a console, because I ain't got time for that shit and I'm going to run Windows on this comptuer
*computer
Nullz: Do you have a dual core, 2 GB of RAM and a 256+ MB graphics card?
https://www.g2a.com/payday-2-steam-cd-key-global.html < you could get it for $8
I dont have a dedicated gpu
its onboard
You're fucked then
They aren't that expensive
I have about 4 of them laying randomly all over my house
I have 8gb of ram though, and a super fast(in ghz) single core with a extra thread
Oh god... What's your definition of "super fast"?
The actual cpu isn't fast :p But if it had more than a single core, it would be pretty great.
I have it overclocked to 4.2 ghz right now.
Interesting, my main PC has a six-core AMD at 2.9 GHz. But, I can't touch it for the next two months or so
That's really fast :/ (Excluding the fact that it only has one core)
Hahahah scrubs, I have a 6 core 3.4 GHz processor
3.9
I'm an idiot
i7 5820k?
six-core 3.9 GHz
An AMD FX 6350
Viper?
I have AMD hardware
I know keeper, because you said AMD :p
I think he has a six-core, the 3600 actually
I have a shitty graphics card, but I don't really care
6300*
Since I don't use Windows
I CANNOT WRITE TODAY FUCK!
and don't game on this
So, I have the 6350, Viperidae has the 6300
https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Darin2000/saved/qMDQzy . Will be changing GPU to 290x/380x/390x depending on release dates and prices at the time.
At school we have like crazy 16 core processors
Xeons?
I think so
I'm not sure though
But those shouldn't work well on none server machines
All I know is we have like 16 core processors and 16 gigs of RAM xD
As they are multiple cores at a low clock rate
We have 1000000 core processors at my school, you're so outdated, Viperidae.
TheWindowsKeeper: It's like 2.6 GHz or something
Which honestly, isn't terrible.
Wow.
Most Xeon CPUs aren't that fast
or 2.4
1.8-2.2 is their range
2.something
Keeper, as long as the software uses more than 1 core it should be fine, and the ones that dont likely dont need more than a 2ghz core xD
^
Honestly, I think that speed is great
until you factor in how much xeons cost.
But my school division payed for it...
*paid
Well yeah
To be fair, Xeons are built for servers, and reliability is a factor in the price.
Well, bacon I think the reason we use them is so we can have numerous VMWare instances running
Viperidae: Also, Xeons are good for their support of ECC memory
Yeah, I would assume though, I am going out now to the shops, talk soon.
TheWindowsKeeper, yup.

I assume using LLVM.
brb
.
I wonder if there will be a Swift execution engine. That'd be pretty awesome.
bacon: Wolfram Mathematica has over 2 GB
A shell file...
2.7 GB to be more exact
Wait what?
A shell file?
.sh
Wait what?
A shell file?
Yes
Does it have the runtime in it?
A simple .sh file has 2.7 GB
I have no idea, it's still downloading
I'm lucky to download with 5.2 MB/s stable
Xcode 7 and Swift now make it easier for everyone to build apps and run them directly on their Apple devices. Simply sign in with your Apple ID, and turn your idea into an app that you can touch on your iPad, iPhone, or Apple Watch. Download Xcode 7 beta and try it yourself today. Program membership is not required.
Holy shit.
Well, there are Android IDEs for that
XCode is one of the greatest IDEs out there.
Right
Well, I can write Android apps directly on my phone
Likewise with my iPod.
Did I say how much I hate Windows?
And that last night at 4 AM it wanted to do 81 updates?
Yup, I've had 170 updates before.
Windows is horrible!
Worst invention in the world... why does it still exist?
It's not as bad as you say it is.
Is it not?
It's just doesn't compare with Linux.
Up until now, it made me a very bad impression... So, I went from Windows to Linux
Didn't touch Windows in ~4 months
And then went back to Windows for a bit
It's horrible.
Just... no.
I haven't used Windows for a year, but I had to go back to it for school.
I'm loving Windows 8.1, apart from searching for apps with the "Modern UI" shit.
It's weird
Windows 10 looks horrible in my opinion but I say that about everything.
Even VS 2010!
Then Visual 2012.
Haha
https://developer.apple.com/xcode/images/xcode-games.png
That looks amazing.
Apple is an evil company
^^
Viperidae, what web browser do you use?
Chrome
Google makes Chrome, correct?
The company which values user's private data more than the moral and ethical business model, just because makes more money?
Yes, I honestly think Google is more ethical than Apple/Microsoft
I think that having DRM rights built into software like iOS is evil
That doesn't justifies 'evil' in my opinion. I thought you were referring to it's patenting and tax evasion.
No, I'm talking about their policy of systemically infringing on the freedom of their users through BSD jails, coding signing,  ect.
That systematical violation increases the security of the device.
At what cost? Prohibiting me from running from own open source code on a vanilla device without paying Apple $100?
That just ain't right
That is evil and it prohibits developers from poorer countries. You should be able to place your device into a 'developer mode'. However, that doesn't justifies evil.
The code signing prevents malicious applications from installing itself onto your device through exploitation of the host computer, because the application will not be able to run.
The code signing prevents users from installing malicious applications disguised as paid applications (which affects the jailbreak community).
I think this dwarfs in comparison to the moral violations brought upon by Facebook and Google. The ability to know everything about you in order to 'increase convenience'. The inescapable world of opt-out (by installing third-party code) to advertisements, which tries to use it's information it knows about you to try to target the advertisement directly towards you, which means you constantly see the same advertisements.
It just doesn't affect you on Google's own website, but the entire web.
Every G+ like button, every embedded YouTube video, every advertisement.
However, Google is a great company too, because the software they make are amazing.
I use Chrome.
I use Android.
Viperidae, I take it back.
Apple is an evil company.
They renamed Yosemite.
"El Capitan."
Viperidae, what is sexyjester?
Chanserv
afaik
bacon: Code signing to prevent malicious code should be optional. Forcing it is like having the NSA send an agent to everyones home to verify they are not terrorists. With security, you loose freedom. Android allows you to turn off code signing, but its enabled by default
bacon what's wrong with El Capitan :D
Viperidae, you lose freedom regardless of if it's configurable.
Anyway.
I think they're changing this.
"Xcode 7 and Swift now make it easier for everyone to build apps and run them directly on their Apple devices. Simply sign in with your Apple ID, and turn your idea into an app that you can touch on your iPad, iPhone, or Apple Watch. Download Xcode 7 beta and try it yourself today. Program membership is not required."
(not changing code signing)

Game about assembly programming...
Like... for real now..
Reagan: http://store.steampowered.com/app/370360/
Game about programming in assembly
Can't view it here sorry
WITCH!!!
?
I am at school
Who cares if you're at school?
Pull up your phone and surf to the game
Also, school is for nubz
I only have 3 days left
Well good for you
TheWindowsKeeper, Reagan, Viperidae
Yes
I just implemented fixed-length and incremental bruteforce
Reagan you can now try to bruteforce JHashes :D
Yay!
lecter -m jhash -i hashes.txt --incremental
:D
Nice
Nice
splitty__, check that game out
So /me forgot to sanitize input from the text box
SQLi :D
Not SQL
XSS
Viperidae *cough cough* used it to inject Javascript
Not XSS
PHP eval?
It's just the php echos the contents of the file
So it was echoing:
<script>alert("gtd is the best");</script>
Can I see?
lol
I deleted it...
You fucker...
Now I am sanitizing *pretty* well
mysql_real_escape_string()?
mysql_real_escape_string is not "well". x
I love how they made a new function because myslq_escape_string sucks
PDO + Prepared statements
$invalid_characters = array("$", "%", "#", "<", ">", "|");
$str = str_replace($invalid_characters, " ", $message);
WTF REAGAN
Interesting idea
Don't do this.
Why?
Maybe because Uncode characters?
Unicode*
oh shite
One can simply emulate < or >
Even &lt; or &gt; could work
Can you try that in just a second
sure
pming you
Reagan: http://puu.sh/iidfV/e9fcbc0d25.png
errr can't see
why
Just look at your board
school web filtering
Message: <script>alert('test');</script>
I see it
xD
It doesn't work though xD
Like it's not executing
Well I don't know what the backend code looks light
Although it is horridly incomplete
And more of a test than an application
But whatever
Oh I know why it doesn't work
wtf post.php was not found on this server
What did you do Reagan
https://github.com/JacobMisirian/TelBoard
Oh shit
I did mv
Not cp
xDD
Nothing works
There we go
Reagan: http://misiriansoft.com/tel/board.php
Goddamn it
:P
So how should I sanitize it
Hahaha
Reagan refresh
wut?
Yeah. I deleted the file.
huh
I can delete files on your system by injecting document.write('<?php unlink("/path/to/file"); ?>');
Please no
I just deleted the data.txt
So how do I sanitize
As you can see, all my javascript injection stuff is gone
mysqli_real_escape_string
But you'll need a database connection for that
errrr
You can use mysql_escape_string without a database
But it's much less safe
Why?
There's functions for XSS-shit.
However.
There's no single function.
echo htmlspecialchars($string, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');
htmlspecialchars won't help you
Either <> or &gt; or &#60; will work xD
What will
Nothing.
I gtg
plz dont haxx me
The only thing you can do it real_escape it
kk
XSS is such a major problem, because the solutions which are supposed to help, don't fully help.
Template engines are useful for preventing XSS.
I could delete reagons /etc/shadows file
lol
NikxDa's here?
or did you link it to him?
I told him to try showing a message to test his haxx0r skills :D
Haha
Yo bacon
We completely destroyed his website
http://puu.sh/iieLA/28391464e4.jpg
Hello
Hello, nikxda.
so splitty__ what were you saying
I like your new board
I really do
Reagan
http://misiriansoft.com/tel/board.php
xDDDD
fucking fuk
You fuked up
Well now it
's not going to echo anything
You children have lost your TelBoard privileges
:/
splitty__: how to sanitize this shit
Think about it
As I said. Use a database instead of a file and use PDO + Prepared Statements
Then do it
WTF HE'S USING A FILE?
Yeah data.txt
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
I deleted it before you started having fun with the site
I have not worked with DBs in over a year
By injecting php tags and unlink xD
Well. It's time to learn it then. xD
And even then it was with a cutsie interface
splitty__, nikxda: you do understanding he's learning right, this is not an official application, there's no warrant to be outrage by the use of files.
There is
It's like creating a chat via FTP
It's bullshit no matter what
Right bacon. But he is writing crap code for a long time now and he really needs to improve it
:|
Also, he wants to sanitize it. If he wants to do it the right way, he should do it the right way. xD
!rep give splitty__
I am looking up some database articles
Not too hard actually
https://www.rosehosting.com/blog/basic-mysql-database-administration-on-a-linux-vps/
TheWindowsKeeper! We need a hero (Cheesoid)!
I'm on Windows
Look at my name
Install python. xD
Cheesoid's on Linux
Damn
Can't access it
Right, there's a clear difference between a ftp chat and using a flat file for a databse.
You can.
database*
I don't want more adware
Ye there is, one is a chat, the other one is a database, both is shit.
TheWindowsKeeper: http://www.paragon-software.com/home/extfs-windows/index.html
That's an ext driver for Windows
You'll be able to access your files
Too lazy
I'll do it in a bit
nikxda, using files for learning is not bad, in fact... in 2007 I did the same thing.
Yeah. In 2007. When you were 9 or something. lol
12
How old is Reagan?
It's not about age.
Yeah ik, just wanted to make clear that 15/16 year old people don't do this anymore
It's about the knowledge of the environment.
Yeah. But he is programming for quite some time now
In PHP?
I worked with files 2 times. One was my first ever project, the second one was because I was unable to make use of Databases due to limitations of my boss.
Reagan had like 30 projects
It does NOT matter which language
More like 50
You should know that you need to use DBs
Last time I used plaintext for storing things was when I was 9, about 7 years ago
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING MAN
^^
!rep give TheWindowsKeeper
bacon: this is my first experience with php, yes
Cheesoid is still not here.
Let's just ignore the fact that good ol' Cheesoid is not here
Reagan I really hope that you don't try to force anal sex on your first girlfriend just because it's your first time and you don't know it better
:|
There's nothing insecure about using files for flat storage, databases require more knowledge. It will not solve the "XSS" problem.
That was....an analogy
xDD
It's okay to do something wrong the first time you do it. But it's not okay to say "I don't know anything about databases" instead of just looking it up and learning it.
There's a learning curve, first you must understand the language.
It's not exactly wrong.
Look at his code. He understood the language. He's properly opening and closing file handles, etc
It's not ideal for production applications, but it's not wrong.
and.
He has worked with C# before, file descriptions is not a PHP-feature.
It
The thing is that he wanted me to try hacking it and that he now just changed the board to just not load our injected shit instead of solving the problem
's cute how you fight over me
I know right, sweetie
splitty__: I want to make it secure
That's why I'm going to use databases
Yeah. It will be as secure as it can get with databases. xD
Really?
And if you properly prepare your statements.
But the CLI is really shitty
XSS still affects database applications.
bacon: it is easier to sanitize though
splitty__: MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE DATABASE db_Tel     ->      ->
It doesn't...worlk
*work
CREATE DATABASE db_tel;
I enter in the proper command and it just displays that weird prompt
Yeah. But I think we all agree that using a database is way more secure and easy than just trying to sanitize the input and redirecting it to a file
Yeah because you forgot to end it using a semicolon;
You can have persistent xss attacks.
which are stored in a database.
Yeah. You can also detonate a nuclear bomb in your basement.
Sure, databases are vulnerable too.
Everything is vulnerable.
But the amount of security that you get with properly handling a database is MUCH higher than the amount of security you get with trying to store everything in a file.
You can imagine the file as just a storage engine, you'll still need to prevent XSS with that.
Yeah. But it's harder to prevent XSS with that.
It's not harder, it's just the PHP developers didn't do a good job.
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_%28XSS%29
I would recommend you read this.
(Reagan)
I will
And I am very familiar with XSS
Then

bacon: I'm finding Windows to be more or less a usable system
It doesn't compare with Linux, but it works
sorta
Yup.
I get that too.
I find it hard to use because of the DOS-based console.
Cygwin makes it usable for me.
I keep writing ls instead of dir
And it's driving me nuts
I know exactly how you mean.
Is there an alias command?
I don't think so.
I think gitscm for windows provides ls and whatnot.
And also, the freaking backslashes man...
Why backslash?
Yeah bacon, gitscm provided ls and some other stuff
splitty__, does it implant itself into the HOME var?
PATH*
Yeah. You can choose if it itegreates into the cmd or not.
integrates*
That's good.
I hate how cygwin doesn't have a built in package manager.
The setup.exe is horrible.

Dunno :D
Oh yeah.
TheWindowsKeeper, I hated the PyCharms logo.
I wanted to find a different one.
and I found this:

There's a PyCharms one.

Awesome
I really want to make a custom project type for my game engine, and a Visual Studio plugin module thinger
Hey Augment
splitty_: Would it be a good idea?
Yeah sure
MonoGame does that too
I don't really know how though...
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/s365byhx%28v=vs.100%29.aspx
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xkh1wxd8.aspx
splitty_: I was about to mention MonoGame's.
:D
Guess what.
I still have not gotten my mudcake.
brb.
:o
Enjoy your mudcake
But for now, I'll live without
It's too early in development to add something like that
Or is it not?
You can always just modify the template if anything drastically changes
I want to add a custom project for content and such
splitty_: Is there some info on how to do things with custom file types?
And normal files
For example, I drag a file in it and it copies it to the appropriate folder
MariaDB [db_Tel]> SELECT * FROM messages     -> ; +----------+----------------+ | nickname | message        | +----------+----------------+ | John     | This is a test | +----------+----------------+
How the content project works in MonoGame and such
YAY
TheWindowsKeeper, there is none.
They use a custom application.
You add the contents to that and build a file.
TheWindowsKeeper, just read the links I've sent you
And you shouldn't use custom extensions
I know
And nice Reagan
I just want something like: I drag a png inside the project, it puts it in the right folder
Like, when you compile
It puts things in an assets folder or something
The documentation for nested projects sucks
He
heyy

Trial and error.
heyyy aurora01
Hello.
test
Aurora01: Cheesoid's broken on Windows
No commands work
And no errors are thrown
The log is clean
Step 1: Which Cheesoid version
?
The one I use on Linux
Step 2: Which Twisted version do you have?
The same exact one, copied
Latest for 2.7.10
It connects
But no commands work
Check the log and stdout for anything and pastebin
Nothing in the log or stdout
As I said, it's as clean as possible
heyy augment
Hello
err,
whoever the hell you are
Uhm
Augment
Yes?
How long should it take to bruteforce a string with a length of 6 letters using a 26 letter alphabet?
26**6
worst case
Yeah ikr that's roughly 1.7e+20
Yeah
But how long should it take in minutes?
Took hashlecter 21 minutes
I feel like that's a bit too long
Well, depends on hardware speed
And on implementation speed
I haven't looked at your MD5, but there might be ways to optimise it
Well my algorithm doesn't use parallelization yet
If you run it on the NSA's servers, expect it to be done before you asked.
And I'm using the .NET implementation of MD5
If you run it on your potato, expect about 10 hours
I heard that the BouncyCastle one is slower than the .NET one
u can crack my md5 ;)
lol
How about I md5 your crack?
My hash is better than my crack
Unity can bake lighting, but no hash brownies
lol
( Í¡Â° ÍÊ Í¡Â°)
Wouldn't it be easier to call a fast, C implementation splitty_?
Probably yes. :D
But I have no idea how fast or slow it is to invoke C code using a .net language
And I would need to use an implementation that I can ship safely with hashlecter
Well, if you just call it and collect its stdout, it shouldn't be that slow
And
you could make it extensible really easy that way
Just provide a standard that all the C hash implementation have to fit, and you can just have a directory of the implementations or whatever
hmm
im extendable *wink*
Descant apparently is 61% JS
Such a lovely language
How about I reduce your functionality ever so slightly... starting with the head, hmm?
Only 15% Python

Aurora01, what is the preferred way to include licenses of other projects?
Good god someone renamed ChanServ to sexyjester
wat do u need help with
splitty_: you can just include the license in the main repo I believe
wut
splitty_: Either include their license header in their files or just copy the main file
whos chanserv
And in the file you took it from leave the original clause
Aurora01 what if I compile something from source? Should I just add a file called projectname_license or something to my repo?
Yeah, ideally.
Depends on the license
ah okay
http://puu.sh/iippd/80013485c6.png
how u doin reagan?
bye augy
Yeah, just follow the instructions of clause 2 splitty_
So I just have to add a file containing the license + disclaimer of the project to hashlecter?
Yeah
Okay nice
It should also be possible to create a single LICENSE file and subdivide it into section for each project right?
sections*
That'd be acceptable
okay thanks

bacon: Have you seen Visual Studio 2015?
It has an amazing live diagnostic tool, it measures memory used in real time, important moments, for example when there's an exception that gets thrown but cought in a try/catch block
It's amazing
The important moment thing
That's been a feature for several versions, that's IntelliTrace right? I think you only get it in Ultimate at the moment though
It'
It's better than IntelliTrace
I'm sure the live diagnostics were also features of pro and upwards, through the performance tools
As I've used it in all prior versions
What's new?
A lot
... Any elaboration on that?
Google it, I can't focus
My brain is broken
brb
oh wait
nevermind

The Diagnostics Tools window contains the following features:      Debugger Events (with IntelliTrace)     Debugger Events (with IntelliTrace) gives you access to all Break, Output, and IntelliTrace events collected during your debugging session.

Cameron, I love how they'll be open sourcing it.
It'd be good if MS put it in Visual Studio
I might actually bother to learn it then
Haha, I have a Macbook, but I spend more time in Linux and Windows than OS X, so it's kinda hard.
But since .NET is going cross platform, not sure I'd need to, would have to weigh up the performance benefits
Ewwww Macbooks
I still loathe Apple

Haha, I wanted to run all three operating systems.
Yeah

Who needs performance?
When you have all the major desktop OSes?

I'm not familiar with the engine, haven't looked recently, but I suppose I can have a look once I shoot this zip back at tc
You just need to refine my tutorial. It's a very simple engine for now and you don't need to learn much
I... don't know what refinements to make
I feel like the tutorial is shit
And it looks bad
And it's not structured properly
TheWindowsKeeper doesn't ChronoGame implement IDisposable?
Nope
I don't dispose of anything
I feel like it should be using (var game = new Tutorial1 ()) { game.Run (); }
You should.
splitty_: Fell free to contribute
You should dispose the GL contexts and stuff
I have no idea how to OpenTK
I gladly take any pull requests
I never really worked with OpenTK
This can be your chance
It's very nice and simple to use
Like, really
Nah I'm busy with Hashlecter
Don't wanna learn OpenTK right now
Can you at least refine something related to the tutorial?
But I'll try to contribute to your wiki.
Yay :D
I never did anything to dispose things
splitty_: OpenTK does all the trashing itself
All I need to do is dispose of my things
TheWindowsKeeper: https://github.com/chronium/ChronosEngine/wiki/Tutorial-1
Amazing.
You are awesome!
Thank you :D
I owe you one
But I'll exploit you more for further tutorials
And when you're done with HashLecter, I might explpoit you a bit for my engine, if you want
Yeah sure :D
You can always ask me if you need help with something. I have enough time and I don't work on Hashlecter 24/7 :P
Nice :D
I don't wanna learn OpenTK at the moment, but I'll be happy to help you with other stuff :D
Okay
Well, if I ever exploit you. You won't have to touch OpenTK
'exploit' him, huh?

I'm going to implement Whirlpool
Hello Augment and Chronium
TheBrokenKeeper, hello
Hi
Aviv: https://github.com/chronium/ChronosEngine/wiki/Tutorial-1
By the way, Aviv, I've merged the branches now ready for v0.1 release, the frontend is in static/descant now
:O
Plus there's the *fun* job of writing documentation to do at some point
Woo!
And we should probably have some sort of static Descant promotion site
Yeah I was working on that but I got distracted lol
xD
Well, there's no rush, we've not got any deadline :P
So basically the master branch is a usable-ish product that people can install, and the backend and frontend branches are for development?
Well, what I was thinking of doing was keeping master as usable, like you say, then just creating a new branch pulled from master that's developed with
It's probably easier just to have everything in one branch rather than a front and backend branch because merging is tempremental with git sometimes
Though it could be kept in 2 separate branches if that would be easier
I'm just going to style the UCP
Yeah, that'd be great
Aviv, do you know who 'rhkdwls7787' is?
Not at all
Weird, they seem to have found and registered at the Descant forum
lol
pptosn gives ya activity just like you thought ;)
xD
Good activity is a different question, of course :P
ha ha
Bye

Because it is fucking complicated. xD
Well, that was quite logical, wasn't it?
I had only the C reference implementation :/
It was pretty hard.
Well, that sucks
I don't even know if I did everything right
I'll test it in a few minutes
xD
IT WORKS
good
Yo Reagan
Hey splitty_
I just had the same thing
I implemented Whirlpool
It was not easy
xD
finally
I just made an account and authenticated  with Tel
finally
What's a whirlpool?
:D
lol
A cryptographic hashing method
duh
512-bits
woah
Take a look at the source
https://github.com/SplittyDev/Hashlecter/blob/master/hashlecter/Implementations/WhirlpoolCryptoServiceProvider.cs
Dat's a wot o bits
1001 lines.
Took me two and a half hours
Wow
That's dedication
wow
^^
Let's see how fast it is
Lol Reagan not really
Hi Viperidae!!
HELLO
Viperidae: wut?
og
Two hours is dedication
Yeah!
Viperidae it was fucking hard :D
But it works, and it is fast. I love it. :D
Oh I'm sure I'm just saying if two hours is your definition of dedication than you have low standards (I'm sure we've all spend an entire day trying to do one thing and failing repeatably)
haha yeah
Night ladies

FUCK

w00 md5ing in PHP
Don't use MD5
^
I'm serious
Ok
+likeovar9000
Recommendation?
BCrypt
With a decent WF, I'm not sure what the current recommendation  is IIRC
I usually use SHA256
Viperidae: The cool thing with BCrypt is that you can vary the amount of work per hash
http://php.net/manual/en/function.password-hash.php
so you get that tradeoff between performance and security
yes
or you can just use the default password_hash function
Aviv: that is BCrypt
lol I know
However that is subject to change
Reagan: Reagan, PHPass
www.openwall.com/phpass/
Yup I'm going to Bcrypt because Augment says so
PHPass is Bcrypt...
Or he could just use BCrypt and reduce the dependencies..
Ah damn it it somehow broke the entire thing :(
Reagan: https://github.com/chronium/ChronosEngine/wiki/Tutorial-1
Here's a more complete example, it draws a sprite on the screen: https://github.com/chronium/ChronosEngine/blob/master/Game/GameTest.cs
Viperidae: Do you like what splitty_ did to the tutorial on the wiki?
He made it all fancy and stuff, mine was looking bad
https://github.com/chronium/ChronosEngine/wiki/Tutorial-1/0e685147b02ee7c93332a769f426904567133f40

Yeah TheWindowsKeeper, it looks nice
also, are you one of these guys now?
What guys?
http://static.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/1871985.jpg
I'm too bored
I can't focus
I can't program for more than 15 minutes an hour
So I decided to try out some games again
It's making my life easier
As you really don't want to know how it is in my possition
So pelase don't get one of your smart comments
Because I can /kill you right away. And don't tell me I didn't warn you
TheWindowsKeeper: it would be unwise to /kick your superior (Viperidae)
*inserts smart comment here*
^
That's why I'm killing him, not kicking him :P
*inserts something else there*
:|
And here there are no superiors
We are all equal
Living in harmony
:|
*inserts another smart comment, then says something slutty*
Flowers, rainbows and fuck life to everyone :D
I'm waiting on Reagan's *facedesk*
*RaeRae's
heyyy raerae
heeeey sexyjester
Do you have those pictures I ask for?
Who the fuck even is this sexyjester?
Augment: Viperidae's ex's screenname
Right...
I got accused last night of being a dictator.
So
I appointed someone new to be in charge
lelwut
So, this channel is now run by sexyjester
Dicktater?
Best idea ever...
As I'm apparently a dictator
[2015-06-09 09:19:38] <bacon> Careful, Viperidae's a dictator.
Proof.
+q
+q who?
CourtneyBot?
yo mama
Ok
I'm the only one using foobar2000 as my main music player?
Yes
Careful now
You don't want to do something you'll regret later
That's what she said
...
:D
Did I mention how much I love the people here?
^
Welp
Some of them
:P
xD
We are the best community out there
splitty_: in America we'd say that this community is like one big 'old married couple'
That's also a quite common idiom in Germany
Really?
Huh
Yeah
We say it's "wie ein altes Ehepaar"
It's quite a common idiom
err
more or less everywhere
so there's that
After all, all across the world, there are old married couples
I'm trying to get a napoleon into joining, but not sure if that napoleon has time or a working computer
a napoleon? wut
You see the users list?
There's napoleon?
oooh
wtf
ahhhhh augy left
Soo...
I want to write a GUI library and make my game
Which will only require that
Nothing more
Nullz and splitty_ have something I believe that could be useful
wats that
There's no Nullz in here afaik
https://github.com/DarinBoyer/Moonshine-GUI
That should be useful
I see how I didn't read your nullz message properly
Fuck
Well...
Umn...
Speak of the devil...
RaeRae, this code looks kinda really quite very messy...
Just a tiny bit...
It's documented
It's Nullz's code lol
Hmm?
Well, it's documented, so, it's not bad
Nullz: I recommended your library to TTK
But there needs to be a folder structure somewhere
What library..?
Nullz: https://github.com/DarinBoyer/Moonshine-GUI
Oh.
Also, Nullz: https://github.com/chronium/ChronosEngine/wiki/Tutorial-1
The tutorial was beautyfied by Mr. splitty_
I need to learn how to document stuff :p
I abuse Mono for that
The code looks awesome though.
This is a more complete example than the tutorial, it draws a sprite on the screen: https://github.com/chronium/ChronosEngine/blob/master/Game/GameTest.cs
And also loads a Python script
Well this is bothersome
When I use md5() it works perfectly
Changing it to password_hash with PASSWORD_DEFAULT it breaks
And I am changing it consistently
RaeRae: Use PHPass please
It's great for password storage
It uses either Bcrypt or Scrypt
The way you use your engine looks alot like Xna/monogame xD
Interesting
Well, this is the basic way anything would work
It's a basic framework that's perfect and it can't exactly be changed that much
Well /me is settling for sha256
Why exactly?
Yeah. Why?
Because the algorithm !works()
*the other
Bcrypt works too
lol
It broke!
nope
Like literally
It works just fine
splitty_: just listen
When I have md5($_GET[password])
Whatever you're going to tell me, I'm not going to believe it xD
or
btw, don't use GET for passwords ffs
hash("sha256", $_GET["password"]);
That works
Use POST for passwords.
My friends skype account got "Hacked" > Hacker messages me asking who I am > Ask him how he hacked it >Backdoor/keylogger > Asks him what he wrote it in > He didnt write it, he just says a program > Give him examples of languages > He says "Dracula logger" > Friend got "Hacked" by a skid >>
GET is as secure as just using no hash at all.
Well
I'd try SHA512
But doing password_hash($_GET["password"], DEFAULT_PASSWORD) does not work
Ok
sha512 it is
Or you could try PHPass?
Or, you could not
Am I like IP banned from tel or something?
Nah
Reagan just do password_hash($_GET["password"], CRYPT_BCRYPT);
You need an account now, and he's not finished with that
Viperidae: sha512 works
Nullz: the login interface will work in 10 minutes
Oh I thought it was ether ip ban or it was finding words it didn't like.
bcrypt is still probably slightly better, but as long as passwords are salted, you ought to be good to go
Nullz I tried that too lol
lol
I thought he banned splitty, but when it blocked Hitler I knew that it was just broken
Why RectangleF TTK?
Rectangle, float
Exactly
ah
I need it a float
As usually, for texture indices you don't hack it like I did with my sprites and use pixels, you actually use a 0-1 value for uv and ut with texture coordinates
I said I should make it easier for the user
But I might consider going back to the good old 0-1
I need to getpaint.net now
Pirating photoshop is better..
I have 3 GB of RAM with a dual core
Paint.net is a good editor
I don't want it to blow up
Especially with plugins
Viperidae, what plugins do you usally use for it?
Lol
Well, none actually because I've never needed them
Actually
I only used a grid maker plugin
Man, foobar2000 is an amazing player
I don't know what the name of this is, but you know when textures don't have alpha and are stored in black and white with the lightness of each pixel being the amount of alpha?
lol
Umn... wat?
I have no idea what it's called
You have a black and white texture
Ah, I know now
The lighter each pixel is, the more alpha it has
Yup
Something to that effect.
That seems pretty useless to me lol
Oldie but goodie: https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat
splitty_: What do you use more, Linux or Windows?
splitty_: I've scene it used for hud textures in video games
I'm assuming the advantage of it is you can change the color to what ever you want
You've scene it used?
Oh yeah
You've *scene* it used?
*seen
And now I know what you mean by that tool
And yes, it's quite useful
TheWindowsKeeper, at the moment I use Windows more. Maybe because my grub got nuked.
Interesting
lmfao this wat
Use easyBCD to solve that
I didn't even need to reinstall GRUB
It just added an option when I once booted Windows, it got myself a dual bootloader
Now whenever I start my PC I can chose between the Winblows bootloader and GRUB
I need more wats
I proudly have done away with Windows
TheWindowsKeeper I love DestroyAllSoftware :D
Yup
It's awesome
Especially the talk about the birth and death of JavaScript
Hey...

Ewww Windows 8
Windows 7 is b etter
bacon: What's better, win8.1 or 7?
Wait, he's away...
Fuck
I'm here.
Which one's better?
You know what's better than both? Neither of them.
I'm no authority on this matter, I simply am a guy with an opinion, but I've grown to prefer Windows 8.1 better than Windows 7.
For some reason I feel like Win 8.1 works better than Win 7
Windows 8.1 is faster than Windows 7
And indeed it is faster
Plus, more advanced screenshot functionality.
Or.. you could just use linux
I would actually pick 8.1 > 7 too.
bacon: You sure?
I swear you can save them to disk.
Where's the functionality?
You can save them to disk in Win7?
I feel like Xfce 4.12's is better
Paint.
The interface of Win8 is horrid.
It has an automatic button to upload to imgur
Viperidae, the only thing I don't like is the "Modern UI" nonsense, the rest is fine.
It looks like some half assed childrens website from the late 90s optimized for Netscape navigator, combined with a shitty VBOS for the traditional desktop
There's no point in fighting over X is better over Y, because there is literally no winner.
It's all up to opinion.
TheBrokenKeeper: http://www.softwareok.com/?seite=faq-Windows-8&faq=69
It doesn't beat your imgur button, but still handy.
(I personally use ShareX on Windows)
Well, I have puush
I use puush, it just gives me a link which I can paste anywhere :D
I don't like puush.
I prefer to build my own makeshift puush with sftp/scp
The fact that the NT kernel is a horrid piece of trash straight out of early micro computers during the 80s is an objective fact
It's also closed source.
TheBrokenKeeper: Why not just VM windows
His computer is slow (the one's he using)
RaeRae: Dual core CPU at 2.2 GHz with 3 GB of RAM
And I want to play games on it
So yeah
You only have 3GB RAM?
I thought you had a desktop
It's a piece of shit laptop, yes
I can't access my desktop PC
As I have a cast and the PC is about 18 meters away from me
I have quad core 1GHZ (whatever that means)
And 4GB RAM
Atom?
And it's a tinyass laptop
Yup
Atom
?
No?
What CPU then?
I don't get why TTK can't just remote into his other PC
Acer aspire V5-122p
AMD A6
Ah
Close enough
Viperidae, nobody can access my PC
Nobody
Except for me
It's close to biometric scanning, but not that advanced
Viperidae, and sadly in this day and age, it's impossible to live a technology nomad with fully open-source software.
Uhm
Does Quad Core 1ghz == Single Core 4ghz?
RaeRae: My desktop PC has six-core at 3.9 GHz with 8 GB of RAM
How does that work?
How it works? I have no idea how I boot my PC, but I can do it
Nobody else can
bacon: Maybe, but I always ask myself "What would Stallman do"
It takes about 10 reboots to boot into it XD
Does Quad Core 1ghz == Single Core 4ghz?
No.
Viperidae, rant?
^^^
Write a post on this blog.
Bingo
Haha
Rant plz

RaeRae, quad 1GHz is not close to a single 4GHz
Then
BETTER YET

NESSIE because cryptozoology?
Nope Whirlpool has been recommended by the NESSIE project
I prefer my reason
:D
I have no idea why, but some function are called NESSIE*, and I used the same function names.

NESSIEinit, NESSIEadd, etc

github.com/JacobMisirian/TelBoard
Simply a suggestion, but you can use HTTP to redirect
echo "<script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.location=\"http://misiriansoft.com/tel/\"</script>";
wtf are you doing
instead of
header("location:/");
xD
https://github.com/JacobMisirian/TelBoard/blob/master/TelBoard/data.txt
Reagan, why are you initializing the sessions in multuple files?
error_log(0); or whatever will fix that /s
It's not to init session it's to authenticate
You should call session_start (); before any output of any kind
$enteredUsername = mysql_real_escape_string(htmlentities(htmlspecialchars(strip_tags($enteredUsername))));
wtf
Yup
Was about to point that out
prepare  statements.
Regardless, nice start.

Hello all
splitty_: Why is writing a GUI system so complicated?
TheBrokenKeeper writing a GUI system is not that complicated
Then I'm just lazy
^^
I want everything, some sort of a window like thing, and everything
But now, CS:GO time
I found out that it works on my laptop
And for the past 4 fucking months, I didn't play at all...
So fuck.
So splitty_, haxx0red TelBoard yet :P
Who hasn't? :l
Nah not yet ^^
Augment: have you?
I've lost interest in hacking TelBoard
Awww
I'm using prepared statements like you told me to splitty_
Not today- are you doing things that aren't retarded with it now
?
... I mean, seriously. Sticking everything in a text file and then outputting it without escaping
I got rid of that about 24 hours ago
Using MySQL with prepared statements
Better.
I already tested for JS injection and SQLi
Did you test for more advanced SQLi?
I ran stuff like:
'; DROP TABLE messages
And I believe that if it were vulnerable a ' should produce a PHP error
You should be more worried about XSS.
Even if you are using the functions, php developers aren't the best with xss protection :P use the library I sent you.
You sent me a library?
It must've been when I was pinging out
htmlpurifier.org
this
Reagan, I cannot login.
I am making some modifications to the system :P
Tell me when I can roam about.
Is there something weird with string comparisons in PHP?
show me what you're trying
It's storing the string (representing the current user) perfectly in $_SESSION
if($_SESSION['logged_in'] != true || $_SESSION["user"] == "" || $_SESSION["user"] == " ") {
Now I know that the logged_in works fine
This only happened just now when I did the session comparison
Reagan, $_SESSION['logged_in'] !== true
You need double equals
Afaik
But...that worked before
I was going to suggest same thing, but even I don't know.
Dunno
Actually that's based on code that Viperidae wrote
I haven't coded in PHP for awhile.
Try strcmp?
I've only had a day's experience :P
sur
*Sure
Usually when I was doing PHP I was using === to compare by value or something like that
Now, I'll be playing games
Reagan, if all fails, try var_dump and send me the result in a PM.
var_dump($_SESSION['user']);
I better make food.
TheBrokenKeeper, Reagan: http://puu.sh/iju3e/b2f3dc2752.png

damn
PM me what it is?
I've modified the windows command-line to look more like a *nix one

typing quick
doskey bashmod=prompt %USERNAME%@%COMPUTERNAME% %CD%# :D
wow so ugly
Yeah. xD
My shock shell is sexy. prompt \u@\h \W\$
I really need to continue developing it.
splitty_: you need to change it up so it can use a normal /
Instead of bullshit windows \
Shock can also look like bash using prompt \u@\h:\w\$
lol
That's impossible
I mean, it's impossible to do that with the cmd
btw, Windows 8 supports both / and \
splitty_: somehow I broke Tel
xD
I have Auth.php here
<?php          session_start();         if($_SESSION['logged_in'] !== true) {                 die(
II must go brb
BTW that code is always returning true
I tried both a single and double equals
do-login.php?name=Splitty&password=Test AND 1=2 UNION SELECT column_name,2 FROM information_schema.columns LIMIT 1,1
oh
splitty_: Can you help me with GUI things?
How would one make a window-like thing?
Create a window manager, create a window class.
xD
I've done that
But related to rendering and such
Each Window and the Window Manager should be implemented as Game Components
Updating and Rendering the Window Manager should update and render all windows
But how to render the actual window? How to do things inside them, so on and so forth
Well, for now, I'll try to implement a button
But later
I want to watch some youtube or something
Just render close/minimize/maximize buttons and borders
Why do you want windows anyway?
A game engine doesn't need those
Then what should I implement?
And take a look at Unreal Engine. afaik, it comes with a full working UI system
Also, I won't implement windows. I don't know why I wanted to do that in the first place
TheBrokenKeeper
You should implement singleton renderers
Instantiating a Renderer doesn't make much sense to me
And it doesn't make much sense to instantiate the script manager
The user should just call an instance of the renderer/manager to do things
No one needs more than one instance of a renderer.
splitty_: You will be able to make multiple renderers
With different things, for example, you could get an object and make a renderer draw to a texture that you then draw on the object
Also, look at XNA's sprite batch, you instanteate that too
And you could also have multiple script managers, maybe you have a set of scripts that only deals with loading in resources. Maybe you have some scripts that deal with object interaction and such
Now, I'll be gaming
Well
You should make the script manager indexable anyway
scripts["player"].Updater (); is way better than just iterating through all scripts.
Which would mean that you'd need to create a new script manager for every single script that has nothing to do with another script.
Update ();*
splitty_: What if you have 100 scripts that you want to update?
TheBrokenKeeper how about that? You can assign scripts to GameObjects
Every GameObject has its own Script Manager
Maybe
You could add Scripts for Health and stuff to the Player, scripts for the Weather to the World, etc
That works
You would update the game objects and the game updates would decide what scripts to execute
game objects*
Seems like a good idea
Also, hoe the heck does IronPython do so much magic with the dynamic keyword?
:D
Like... I can turn a ScriptScope into a dynamic thing and simply call functions and such from it
foreach (Script s in Scripts) {
((dynamic)s.ScriptScope).load();
}
splitty_: Like, that would call the load function from Python
Is there any tutorial on how that works?
splitty_: I found it. And it's fucking awesomr
Awesome*
Nice
ThePhoneKeeper / TheBrokenKeeper
You could also add Lua support
https://dynamiclua.codeplex.com/
I'll try
splitty_: What about http://www.moonsharp.org
Looks a little more up to date
Never used Moonsharp
For now, I'll stick with Python
As using IronPython I can actually write the whole game in it. No C# needed
I'll try that actually soon-ish
Okay
I don't know what to code
Hashlecter is in a usable state and there is not much to do currently
splitty_, take a break and admire https://github.com/JacobMisirian/TelBoard
xD
It's wonderful, isn't it
Just.. beautiful..
splitty_: I love how he uses PHP, JS and HTML in that post.php file
Yeah :D
I'll game some more
Hello, Aviv.
Hello, Aurora01.
Hi Aviv
Hi Viperidae
errr, have to fake a report card
bacon: You here?
Or splitty_?
I need to forge my districts watermark
Right
Aviv, I think it might be a good idea to include CSS-Framework in the Descant v0.1 release so that if it gets updated, it doesn't break v0.1 forums
Since it still uses rawgit currently, doesn't it?
I need a fucking vector image of their logo, everything I've found so far is too small :(
I need to think, but I can't
I want to program, but I'm stuck
The brokenness is getting worse...
I'm close to being very broken
yah Aurora01 I was going to do that
Good
Never watch 5 episodes of a TV series when you're sad, especially if the episodes you watched are fucking filled with sad shit...
I'm fucked
Viperidae did you infect Kaspersky with Vulcan? xD
Today is officially the shittiest day in the past two weeks
lolwut no
http://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article142297574/Virenjaeger-von-Kaspersky-finden-Virus-in-ihrem-Netz.html
Can't find an english version of this..
https://securelist.com/blog/research/70504/the-mystery-of-duqu-2-0-a-sophisticated-cyberespionage-actor-returns/
Here
A modular malware that uses manipulated images to store data xD
Hahahaha, the stenography used by Vulcan was very primitive. It basically uses a 1024x1024 image to hide shit in, using each RGB value to store a single byte by storing 3 bits in the R and G value, and 2 bits in the B value.
^^
:)
It's precisely 1 month since Descant's first commit, and we're just about ready for v0.1.0 release
How timely.
Nice
^^^^^^^^ <--- means "fuck my life"
STOP MESSING UP MY SMUXI LAYOUTT
*LAYOUT
Sorry...
Much better.
Sorry :(
I just do a /clear for that though
Right
Slackroad's the one to teach me... blame him
well bye slackroad
Aurora01, HexChat handles messages like that properly
It's a fork of XChat
Or, you could just not do it :P
How does Smuxi mess up the layout?
^^
Sorry Aurora... It's not my fault, I'm having a shit day...
Aurora01 did you see my WHIRLPOOL implementation?
splitty__: nope
Aviv, no idea.
https://github.com/SplittyDev/Hashlecter/blob/master/hashlecter/Implementations/WhirlpoolCryptoServiceProvider.cs
Aviv, remember to commit to the master branch now by the way
ok
I've implemented the Whirlpool hash because there was no good implementation in C# :D
Aviv: http://puu.sh/ijUfk/56bc0a6169.png
That's how it breaks it
are you just going to remove the front and back branches?
Probably.
Because merging them took me about 30 minutes xD
xD
lol
Cool, now I'll be away
Can't you just copy and paste the files? :P
lolno aviv
I mean, he could
If you don't copy the symlinks, git explodes
Aurora do you like my implementation? :D
Yeah
yay
It's witch-free code
:D
Personally I'd recommend using braces even for the one-line if/for blocks for consistency, but that's just my view
My slightly Python-inspired view of how things should be
I do that too, Aurora01
It just seems odd to me to have one rule for one-line blocks, and another for everything else
I only leave off the braces when I think that it doesn't make it less readable
My opinion is that you should establish one rule and always follow it, but it's not a major issue by any means
hmm okay
hmm listen to Aurora01 he's always right
If we'd have Python-like syntax in C#. I'd be the happiest person on this planet
make your own compiler then
As I find square brackets to be a waste of space
If there was Python-like syntax in C#, it would be Python :P
xDD
We need .Net staticly typed Python
And then we're set
or
NAH
As IronPython is just Python for the CLR
you could use VB!!!!!!
wtf
/kill Aviv First warning
Aviv keep your mouth clean
VB is a bad word
VBA is the best language
totes
Wouldn't you rather type End If instead of }?
I'd rather write 'Thanks VB, I'm done with the if now'
I'd rather type "This filthy conditional block shall be closed"
I am pretty sure that's possible in Shakespeare
It is
Afaik
I don't have much experience
Or what if you typed a bunch of exclamation marks!
If (TTK->isaway() == true)
!!!!!!
I think that is best
Yeah. the number of exclamation points is the amount of indentation
True
Or what if instead of that, you just wrote random letters!
AvivLang is the best
That would be hard to parse.
All hail TelBoard
http://misiriansoft.com/tel/
^
Is it vulnerable to XSRF, [Mobile]Reagan?
No
I have it sanitized for html/js and SQLi
Apparently it is
Wut?
Pm me
http://misiriansoft.com/tel/board.php
splitty__
I have something super cool to tell you!
Dreh den Swag auf!
Pm me how you did thay
*that
What did Aurora01 do?
Do you see the test alerts?
That appear
Anyway, I must go now.
Goodbye, poeple.
*people
Bye Aurora01
WHAT THE FUCK
My image editor STOPPED fucking working
How so?
Everything is frozen
Do you want to build a snowman?
No
Let it go! Let it go! Can't hold it back anymore.
I had to do it, I'
I'm truly sorru
sorry*
Now, I might be more away
Wtf Aviv :D
Money boy?
lol
you know it?
Sure lol
lol
so awesome ya?
Yeah
xD
Aviv, the on screen Win8.1 keyboard is sorta useful
I used it for accent marks lol
But now I have made my own special prÃ³gram for that
But it doesn't compare to a phone :P
lol
It should probably merge with WP's in windows 10
WP's is much better
HTC Sense 7's is much better
Have you used a WP keyboard?
One sec
That looks 100% broken, hard to use and useless
lol what?
Sense 7's: http://info-android.com/upload/posts/c7/5d/8048/4f121b07ce7e946a886f85220d8d01022ad85319.jpg
they look... almost exactly the same...
Except with less clutter lol
You sure?
Useful clutter
For symbols you use how often now?
All the time
For a ' I just long press 'c'
for ' I just long press period and drag
and for example
let's say you wanted to type
Ã¡
How would you do that?
Hold on 'a' and drag
So... you have ! and Ã¡ on there?
I'm still not clear on how it is broken either
Ã?Ã¦Ã¥Ã£ÄÄÄ?Ã«ÅÅ£Å
Are just some of them
Okay
ÃÃ some more useful ones
Can you swipe on letters to make "words"?
Hi Emily!
Yup
Ah
Heya
Do you get word suggestions at the top of the keyboard?
Still can't believe my ISP blocked int0x10
pisses me off so much
:O why?!
What is your ISP?
This is all written through swipes and yes, I do get suggestions
BT
http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/qM7IdBWtQ6I/maxresdefault.jpg like that?
Although I find it slower than typing manually
http://www.productsandservices.bt.com/products/broadband-packages/?s_intcid=con_hpbop_bb
Do they present a reason as to why they blocked it?
Even better, Aviv
"sure"
I can also swipe to write your name. Aviv
Great
I don't think I can do ThePhoneKeeper, though lol
yeah it does Aviv for me too
Echos, does it do that too?
if you type Tel, it suggests Aviv
It might
it puts in Echoes
But I'll add Echos to the dictionary
Never fear
Mine is smarter then :D
RaeRae is here
yep it does now, ThePhoneKeeper
They provide no reason
lol
bantaful
lol why is it smarter to insert a fake word, ThePhoneKeeper?
Who knows if it's fake
I would not want it putting in fake words, that makes the whole thing useless lol
Aviv: https://m.facebook.com/echosofficial
There, not fake :D
it's still not a real word...
It works
look in an English dictionary and tell me if you find it...
in almost every case the person would've wanted echoes
Now I'll stop with the swiping, it's annoying
Echoes works too
Echoes, Echos, works
lol kk
But when you type JRM, does it suggest Keynes?
Because that sort of freaked me out because I had never typed JRM Keynes on my phone before....
hahahaha
I suppose it syncs from my PC
Maybe, I stopped auto predictions and swipe now. It was making me type slower
lol
Aft
It just depends on how good the predictions and swiping are ;)
Does a client exist that streams torrent as music like Popcorn Time streams movies? or just a client with pirated music
Or you could buy movies
no
Emily, use uTorrent. But you need the pro version for music streaming
Or just use YouTube?
This is CRAZY. Why is there no such client similar to Popcorn Time but towards Spotify/Tidal
Dunno
YouTube or uTorrent
http://atraci.github.io/Atraci-website/
Nice
HEY EMILY!
http://www.agardenersforum.com/ descant should look more like this
Hey splitty_ !
hi
How is Emily?
Emily is good
How is Aviv
Goodie!
Emily, are you still planning to visit me? :D
I'm sure he is
Depends on timing at the moment
My schedule got super busy
Emily: this is visiting splitty__ we're talking about!
This is a once in a life time sort of thing!
Right?
True but I don't have much of a say in regards to what I'm doing
http://9gag.com/gag/aXp81dP
Hmm k
Emily, just tell me in time
I hate how broken Smuxi for Winblows is...
splitty__: Can you draw?
splitty__ can do anything sillyh
Aviv: Can you draw?
no
Well fuck...
I can't draw ^^
Well fuck... x2
Aviv, Win8.1 blue screens look weird
Nullz, what OS do you use?
lol the blue screens are fine, ThePhoneKeeper
They are weird
Not really
win8.1
And contain a frown emote
How can a bluescreen possibly be "Fine"
^
Soo... I got my first BSOD...
It was fun
It even had a sad face on it...
I think it's trying to tell me that my CPU is frying and so is my RAM
yeah it had a sad face
That's good
How is that good?
Told you that you need thermal paste >>
http://www.iwillfolo.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Windows-BSOD.jpg
Nullz: What can't you understand? I cannot open this fucking laptop up, okay?
isn't it an adorable BSOD
It is impossible without the required tools
ik :p
I think it also changes color based on accent
so
ACOD
any color of death!
Great...
i've gotten 4 in 2 years(3 of them I forced to happen because I was testing out a pranking bluescreen thing) all of them were blue
Let's just say they broke what was best about Windows
The blue screens
SO I just came out to my best friend
She was like "okay nice, which pronouns??" and i was like "i use the binary pronouns" and that's the end of that
xD
Emily, zer, zi.
Heya
he,she
Hello, Emily.
Woah.
but y'all be used to that anyway
Those are new.
wow
oh pronouns are kewl
2kewl4u
You are too kewl for me, Emily!
I always will be
So, Emily, what did you exactly come out as?
Genderfluid.
Homosexual Transsexual Dolphinkin.
I'm a bisexual genderfluid human.
Okay
That's tookewlforme btw
BACON HOW Did yoU KNoW
Emily, I read your emails to the dolphinkin foundation
You're also a helicopterkin.
It's not a matter of it being 'cool', it's being true to myself and expressing who I really am. Especially via the dolphinkin foundation
Hahaha.
bacon, you need to stop leaking my secrets or I'll leak your nudes
OH
Fine, I will leak them,
I think I found one

Heyo Nullz
How good does this look?
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/98653239/reportCardMarkII.png
Fantastic
Reagan, how does this look? https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/98653239/reportCardMarkII.png
I'm not sure what an actual report card looks like :P
(for your school)
Although I think that you should give yourself 1 or 2 absences
Reagan: Like this https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/98653239/SCAN0007.JPG
Also
My parents don't know I skipped any days
Still
Just to appear legit
Actually
They do
Don't they
Your dad knows
I CAN STILL DO SCHOOL?!?
Yeah, but he told me to cover it up
He doesn't want my mother to know
So your dad will know this is a fake?
Because then he'd be responsible for not doing anything about it
My best 2 grades were an A and a B my third is under an F
Or my dad will think I pulled some trick to not be absent
But your dad is still gonna know this is fake card
No he won't.
i will never understand the american education system
Viperidae: he knows you missed a day
I know he knows that
So when he sees no missed days
if we're not registered then the head of sixth form calls our parents straight away, emails are sent out
1 != 0
Reagan: That doesn't matter
I can easily pull of not getting marked absent, and he knows that
wtf is 'credit'
How much the class is worth
or 'per abs'
what why do your classes have worth
per abs means period absences.
oh okay
still don't understand why your classes have worth though
Emily: neither do I
but on a different level :P
Well, the classes most people take are only worth 1.0. That means, when your GPA is calculated it just goes in there once.
the fuck is a GPA
^
Grade point average?
Nullz: you don't know what GPA is
the fuck
?
Your final average score for High school?
Reagan: I'm going into 8th grade.
score? wtf
lelwut Nullz
Grade?
Like A, B, C?
I thought you were 14
We sit exams and get given grades for each of the subjects. I sat 28 exams in three weeks
Nullz?
I was held back in 1st grade because I didnt know how to read >> that was the summer I got into computers and played this "wizard101" game which literally teached me how to read :/
I was 14 most of my 8 grade year
So i did 1st again for nothing
*8th
Sometimes I don't know how to read so
I'm 15 and in 10th grade
omg yeah you guys get held bak
back8
I'll be 15 in September though.
Emily: you know what's funny
That ain't a thing in England
Not anymore emily.
I was 16th the majority of my 10th grade year, I'll be 18 in October
You seem so professional and whatnot in your youtube videos
And then on IRC
^^^
XDDD
Youtube link?
It's so true
You're all like "POOP ON MY DICK"
????
since when did i want poop on my dick ew thats gross
OKAY I NEVER WANTED THAT TO HAPPEN AND I THREW UP SO
I don't express my sexuality or anything too personal on my YouTube as advised by my manager so
although i do hint at sexual abuse during one of those vids
ForsakenIdol?
Nullz: https://www.youtube.com/user/thejjaclub
I like your channel.
Lol, Nullz I'm forsaken idol
omg
+1
Oh thanks<3
Emily: I love your video on Feminism (sorta)
Where you give an example
(it had a very tumblr approach, sorry)
And you're like "what if emily only makes this much"
omg
Emily: that wage gap study you talk about has been debunked like 8 times
Those statistics are British ;)
Even still
and were sourced from last year
I'm gonna go to sleep
Goodnight
I'm not saying they aren't real
NIGHT
But their methods were bad
All they did was compare the average women salary to that of men
I thought you were gonna mention that i used my gender persona Emily
I did
Without taking into account women who choose not to work or work part time
Good :P That video is outdated so ;P
https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=1oqyrflOQFc
I ain't arguing against you, at the time it was accurate and now it ain't so :P
Errr
It wasn't really *ever* accurate
It might have been /considered/ accurate
u think i actually care rn
Nope
lel neither do I
I just wanted for you to know
Also I did share your video arounf
*around
Like I do care about equality and I realize that the gender pay gap is fictitious
I now read your messages with your voice xD
It was a lot better than the "FUCK H8 VIDEO"
OH great :P
And thanks aha!
Emily: you know what I'm talking about right
Potty Mouthed Princesses
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqHYzYn3WZw
But please don't forget that when I'm Emily, I use the she pronouns. If I'm Josh on here then it's he pronouns.
This video is almost laughable
You should upload more.
Emily: what do I identify as on your gender?
LOL: https://youtu.be/XqHYzYn3WZw?t=49
Nullz, the issue I have is that it's very seasonal and in accordance to my current mental state in regards to uploads
And what do you mean, Reagan?
What gender do you identify as
.
NickServ<	identify ****
Good morning
bacon: Do you have any idea on what I should make first with my very incomplete game engine?
Ichiru!!!
Hello!
hi
Have you seen my latest work?
no
https://github.com/chronium/ChronosEngine/wiki/Tutorial-1
you inherited ChronoGame from GameWindow didn't you?
Nope
oh
the FrameEventArgs made me think it was
Ichiru: https://github.com/chronium/ChronosEngine/blob/master/ChronosEngine/ChronoGame.cs
looked at it x)
Do you have any idea on what I should try and implement first?
make a game
and add to the engine as you go
That's the problem, I don't know what game to make
Ichiru: My game engine supports IronPython scripting
nice
But the current way I'm doing things is bad
I'm going to try and make it both 2D and 3D. Currently, it's 2D only
Ichiru: Do you have an idea on what type of game I should make?
go
platformer
idk how to make one but it sounds fun
NEVER!
Last time I tried, I quit in the first moment I tried
first moment I sarted*
As collisions suck
I couldn't get a basic collision system and such
Ichiru: Should I make the map renderer a Python script?
sure
super modular engine woo
I can also make it support C# scripts and Lua scripts too
I officially hate windows
I need to use the fucking command prompt to open a simple file...
PPTOScrub
Viperidae, are you here?
What is it with this idiot ^
He's not even pinging out
I could say the same about Reagan xD
[keyl0gged]Reagan?
Haha.
bacon: Why the fuck doesn't my Visual Studio build when I press F5?
not sure.
Fixed it
The build thing for it wasn't checked
bacon: Were window titles in the midle back in Windows 7?
Win7, the title was floated to the left
Amazing.
Being able to use Python scripts with C# is so fucking awesome!
I love that I implemented them
Now, I'll be gaming for a bit
I need to brainstorm a map renderer
hello!
Hi vegra
Viperidae: He wants to rule #OSN
15:57 <vegra> we re the new moderator ð
wut
We have *nothing* to do with OSN
I know XD
But he self claimed himself as the ruler of that XD
#OSN is ... a thing?
wankers
^
Soo... I opened up mylaptop4
And then had a heart attack...
Because after I put it all back together, it wasn't starting
Sex-tape.mp4.exe?
Oh
It turned out that it just was that the RAM wasn't inserter properly
bacon, you here?
Also, this shitty dual core laptop has DDR3 RAM
I'm amazed
Yeah, TheBrokenKeeper.
bacon: Can you believe that it has freaking DDR3?
Actually PC3 which is the DDR3 for laptops
So bacon you been coding lately or "chewing the fat" *heavy sarcasm inbound*
[Mobile]Reagan: You need to implement Python scripting in all your future C# projectsw
It's a must
How does one do that?
IronPython
Look at my game engine for example
TheBrokenKeeper, I'm building libnotify.net
I need desktop notifications in windows xD
Nice

Hello, Cameron.
Hello, Aurora.
Nope, can't talk like that, feel like evil villain
Those days are over
sorry, died.
OVER I TELL YOU
Hey, Cameron. It was only official over on Tuesday.
BUT TUESDAY WAS A LONG TIME A GO
Like.
AGO

Anyone here know what Edmodo is?
lol
Viperidae, nope.
Now I do.
Well, it's basically an online educational rip off of Facebook
You join a group with a code
So, all students in my school taking Honors English 12 have to do a summer assignment
This summer assignment will be managed online through Edmodo
On an Edmodo page, any user can post shit to the page's "wall" (Think Facebook)
There is no captcha's or anything when creating a new Edmodo account
But it's educational, so it's OK
And to be fair, CAPTCHAs are useless now anyway
Anyways, I disagree with the notion of summer assignments
And think it's my job to liberate students from cruel tyrannical summer assignments
So, I'm going to write a bot that will create over a thousand new Edmodo accounts linked to this group
Then use them all to spam gay pr0nz, gore, ect
Forcing the teacher to change the code
Locking everyone out of the group
It will be a glorious cause!
It's weird, I asked the teacher for something to do on the 'summer' (not summer here) break.
Or, in the time you waste spamming it, you could just *do* the work
Aurora01, please don't be absurd. Spamming is the way.
Lol Aurora01 that's a horrible idea
/kill TheBrokenKeeper No spamming.
I'm a freedom fighter
Summer assignments are the worst things a teacher can give to the students
I should be constrained with stupid assignments to do when I'm on holiday
Unlike the cowards who are too lazy to do anything, I will fight back! And make a difference!
Viva la revolution!
But you won't make a difference
Yeah I will
Well, no positive difference
The thing is, the teacher will be forced to change the code
Locking all of the people from the group
Meaning that no one will be able to do the assignment
But surely they'd guess who used the code to spam it?
That's irrelevant, as they won't have any evidence linking it to me.
and if they try to take action against me for their mere suspicions, I will take them to court
Plus, since Edmodo is so big, I'm sure they already have spam prevention stuff
No they won't xD I've done raids like this before with people on 4chan
Why would anyone ever want to go to 4chan?
It's like the hell of the internet.
Viperidae: why is it than whenever you talk of "glorious causes" I read your text in my head with the accent of someone from ISIS
4chan is love. 4chan is life.
^
They don't talk like that, but lol
LOL
Some OP posted a pic of a phone in Imessages with the number at the top
Saying we should spam that number
I just got the OPs number by texting the "target"
https://www.dropbox.com/s/tis8ft7dzgpklkd/Screenshot_2015-06-11-14-06-17.png?dl=0
splitty__: check that shit out
LOL
splitty__: http://boards.4chan.org/b/thread/621166227 and Viperidae
That's where that comes from
I'm about to prank call him
404 Not Found
Apparently the OP's name is Hussein
Goddamn it
Hello
Viperidae I feel like you're getting a little ambitious about avoiding homework
Oh no
LOL Viperidae
I just left a message for Mr. Hussein
About to send dropbo link
*dropbox
Viperidae: https://www.dropbox.com/s/o3zjjtwceoz3dtz/Kazam_screencast_00001.mp4?dl=0
Lol
That was a good 4chan visit
Hello Aviv.
Time to see if he has facebook
Viperidae: SHIT
SHIT SHIT SHIT
Guess who just tried to friend us?
Ross MacHattie
Aviv, will you be able to style the user control panel when you get time?
Viperidae
Â¡Claro que sÃ­, Aurora01!
lol
That's funny
J'apprÃ©cie, Aviv!
Viperidae: not really
Or perhaps, more accurately
What if he reports us
Je l'apprÃ©cie!
After all we are using his Son's picture and name
So fucking what, then the account gets deleted. No big deal
Meh
It's the only fake FB account we got though
If it wouldn't be too much trouble, would you mind moving your 4chan stuff to another channel?
Aurora01: This isn't 4chan stuff
lol
Well, whatever it is.
:\
Far weirder talks have happened in #int0x10
#int0x10 is all about peace and love man
And bacon
Indeed, there is insufficient bacon here.
And witch hunting
Your conversation is diluting the baconation of the channel.
Indeed, it's like cheap Tesco bacon with too much water, simply steaming away and shrinking into nothing
So, begone, bacon impostors.
Meanwhile, hooray for Docker and Vagrant
It makes the Django build process so much easier
Woo, got my C# code to going through tor
lol
Viperidae: I got a Python class going in C#! Woo!
How did you integrate tor into a C# app
yay
Can you just use torsocks
torsocks mono spam.exe
WebClient.Proxy, and privoxy
I wouldn't recommend doing that
I don't know how well torsocks would work with mono
Tor has socks?!
:|
Reagan, why does TelBoard use OOP-style prepared statements at the start, and imperative-style at the end?
Like in https://github.com/JacobMisirian/TelBoard/blob/master/TelBoard/do-signup.php
Viperidae: My fucking shitty laptop has DDR3/PC3 memory, I'm amazed
I think I started to switch stuff up Aurora01
Like as I learned more
.
Honestly, using a pre-built framework saves you a lot of effort and reduces the risks of XSS, XSRF, SQLi, etc, etc
I think I told him to use Laravel too
I said that as well :P
But, as I say, Django is the best way.
Or, melt your brain with Node.js
lol
Become a full-stack developer; master of JS, no other skills.
or make the entire software in jQuery
Aviv, tiny flaw in that plan
How is the server supposed to work?
It doesn't
you're talking to yourself
LoneForums
^
For those who just want to be alone
(and for those who can't afford a proper server)
lol'
I can't
What's Aviv's plan?
that's why I have my super awesome free shared hosting
Reagan: my plan is to take over the entire tri-state area
Oh?
You do not know what I speak of?
errr
I'm going to have to reinstall mono
Aviv: what is it
oh no
I can't tell you
Aurora01: io.js?
io.js is being merged with node
Slowly
But I have no intention of ever using either
lol
JavaScript's too evil for me
You get used to it eventually.
All the callback soup, random oddities, etc.
Aviv: https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript
YES!
My bot works
Viperidae: how many accounts?
So far
I haven't began mass generating them yet, I just was unit testing the EdmodoClient but I can register new accounts
Once I reinstall monodevelop I'll began mass creating drone accounts
Aviv: Today I almost broke my laptop
But now it's working
Oh no, what happened?
And working better, overheating less
I opened it up to clean it
Took out the RAM
Woo
brb
And when I put the RAM back, I didn't put them properly in
Aurora01: I just realized that C puts it's buffers in the stack...
Because that's why buffer overflow attacks work
Alright
We're generating accounts
One account every 20 seconds
Nice
Well, got to go now.
hi
Reagan: have you converted Tel to Node.js yet?
No
Is it server side?
Yes.
It runs on Google's V8 engine [citation needed]
And so the attack begins
Lol Reagan, members went from 18 to 54
It's goiNice!
Yay I broke TelBoard!
lol
It's doing that one thing
You know
Where it doesn't work
:P
I should rename TelBoard to Compton
OopsDidISayThatOutLoud
Viperidae: I may have a problem
?
I used to check error_log for php errors
But was getting filled with errors from our "clients" from that php code you wrote
So I rm'd error_log
And remade it
But it's not being populated anymore
Interesting
Ha
I figured it out
That was good
I guessed httpd uses like a streamreader or something where the file would still be "open" in a sense
So it was probably writing to /dev/null or something like that
So I restarted apache
I never thought I'd be so happy to see errors
:O
Or use Django
Reagan: Over 90 accounts so far
Or use ASP.NET ;)
Why does it take so long Viperidae
It's generating roughly 2.3 accounts per minute (I did this on purpose, so the server doesn't think its a DDos)
lol
108 accounts now
127 accounts and rising
woo
Viperidae: open source your edmodo bot
Become famous
Acquire bitches
(as Aurora would undoubtedly put it)
Ok
Reagan: It's really simple, and I don't want to put any evidence linking me to this on the internet like that
Err fine
Also, it really isn't production ready anyway. I just edited Main.cs for creating accounts on this one group
using (StreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter(new FileStream("creds.txt", FileMode.Append))) {
EdmodoClient client = new EdmodoClient();
for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
Well fuck you then
+!
Reagan: +! = 6.0415263e+52
+? TheBrokenKeeper
There's no mathematical operation for ?
...
^
+#
+*
+)
+fuckurbitch
Well, it's the ternary operator xD
++
++-+++-
But ! is factorial, and factorial(+) = fact(43) = 6.0415263e+52
But Reagan's usage would be incorrect
Indeed
+++
+1336
That would increment the current cell by 3, brainfuck rullz
+++--+ would make the current cell be 2
ok
Over 155 drone accounts :)
Viperidae: what are you calling them?
You want to see?
Yes
Are they "trolly" names?
\Or just pseudorandom strings
I love how 155/169 members of the group are drones
Viperidae: can you control the drones all at once?
Like have them *all* start posting gay pr0nz?
I'll add that feature, right now my program just generates accounts
kk
Once I have enough accounts (Friday probably) the attack will commence
So how many students IRL are supposed to join this edmodo?
I need to make sure I begin the attack early, because my goal is forcing the teacher to change the code, therefor making it impossible for new students to join.
Reagan: Best guess, 226
That's probably too high though
Maximize effect lel
If I ever am forced to join edmodo would you spam them for me? xD
My school's population is 1,809. I just divided that by 4 (Each grade) then divided that number by two (Advanced english, vs non advanced english)
There were like 16 accounts on here before I began creating drones
It will be funny will I have more drone accounts than students in my school
LOL what if the teacher got an email notification every time someone new joined
I was thinking that
In which case you should probably /write/ the gay pr0nz spamming
That way yyou can activate it at a moment's notice
In case she sees all the kids and gets alarmed
It'd be even better if there was a limit to how many accounts she can have
LOL
Is there
To my knowledge, no
https://support.edmodo.com/home#entries/21856320-create-a-group-teacher
Look at number 5 and 7
" The Group code automatically lock after 14 days or if the teacher locks the Group before that time. If a locked code is used, a request to join will be sent to the teacher for their approval."
Yeah, I've already read that
And I know that
(That it locks after 14 days)
Ah
You can at the very least bombard the teacher with emails
That is some serious LOL
Indeed :)
I'll try to only use one account though for posting pr0nz at once
She will think its one account
Delete that
Then I just another
Her first course of action will probably to make it so people who join are read only.
I'll be able to counter that by registering a shit ton of accounts beforehand
https://support.edmodo.com/home#entries/21687959-manage-or-remove-members-in-your-group-teacher
Hahaha, they're no way in hell they'll be able to delete or make all my accounts read only with the tools Edmodo provides
FUCKING PHP
FUCK
I make like a minor change
Everything breaks
The 'error' is full of shit
And there's NOTHING wrong with my code
Fuck
And I have no way of reverting the file
$query = "SELECT id, nickname, message, reply, replied FROM messages ORDER BY id DESC";
if ($stmt = mysqli_prepare($conn, $query)) {
mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);
mysqli_stmt_bind_result($stmt, $id, $nickname, $message, $reply, $replied);
Guessing there's something wrong with your code
mysqli_stmt_fetch(): Couldn't fetch mysqli_stmt
Line in question:  while (mysqli_stmt_fetch($stmt)) {
I haven't even made any changes to this area
Wow
It wasn't with that section
Somehow a sneaky close() line made it into the bottom of the loop
248 accounts
WooHoo: http://misiriansoft.com/tel/board.php
Basic replying is implemented
Yay
Check it again
The reply buttons are there
But I need to secure this all
https://www.dropbox.com/s/puz5eyvcf463eft/2015-06-11%2017.39.48.jpg?dl=0
So
Reagan, what do you think?
I think they're nice
It's like a greenish grayish combination
Reminds me of camo a ltitle
*cammo
I have some just like those
wut
:/
I was talking about the report cards not my shorts xDDDDD
the report card looks legit
Iknow
Hahaha
Ok it has been secured
Check out misiriansoft.com/tel/board.php
People can now have conversations in comments
I will now make some UI improvements
Yay
You are not logged in! Log in at http://misiriansoft.com/login.html
:(
Viperidae: now that I know how to modify tables without deleting everything you should make an account
Your account was probably deleted
:(
Yeah Viperidae you will need to create an account
Aviv: you should get using TelBoard
Where?
login.html is straight up 404
No thanks, Reagan
And http://misiriansoft.com/login.php is
Well
Why not?
Wow
Aviv
Viperidae: login.html is not a 404
Not Found
The requested URL /login.html was not found on this server.
http://misiriansoft.com/tel/login.html
That's what I get
NO
Viperidae: N
O
misiriansoft.com/tel *emphasis on tel*
login.php is for V
So *some*one registered as: alert(&amp;quot;Hi!&amp;quot;)
Then change the message that says  You are not logged in! Log in at http://misiriansoft.com/login.html

Viperidae: http://misiriansoft.com/tel/board.php
How did you reply that quickly
Hello, World! as MisirianSoft	This is my first post to TelBoard! I've put a lot of hard work into it!
Replier: r00t as r00t	Reply: Heyyyy
Nullz: replying is implemented in TelBoard
You should make a show replies button
Nullz, you know what Edmodo is?
No?
Its like a tutor?
Lolno
It's an educational rip off of Facebook
Basically, a teacher creates a group where students can post, and the teacher can post assignments, ect
In order to join a group, you need a unique 6 digit code
At my school, all rising honors english 12 students have been assigned a stupid summer assignment
The summer assignment will be done through Edmodo
Personally, I disagree with the notion of summer assignments, and I find this assignment an unfair waste of my time.
Then dont do it..?
Well...
I could not do it and get a 0
Or...
I could make it so no one has to do a summer assignment
haahalol
Dont get cought/in trouble though.
Night hoes
So, my idea is this. I will create a whole bunch of drone edmodo accounts that will join this group (I have over 300 drone accounts created so far by a bot). then I'll use all those drone accounts to spam gay pr0nz and gore on the page.
My bot right now is running creating approximately 2.3 accounts per minute
Oj ja good luck Viperidae
GUDNIGHT
Once I begin spamming her with shit, she'll try several things to stop it
One involves changing the group code
If I can get her to do that, so new accounts can't join; then she'll lock everyone else out of it. Meaning, a good portion of students will not be able to complete the assignment
Are you creating the accounts with a VPN?
or proxy
Tor
Tor FTW
I dont think youll get cought unless somebody else knows xD
Wait, isn't there alot of people at your school you knows your good /w this?
Nullz: they'll have no proof
Viperidae: if they ever bring you down to the office and say "Sloan, do you know why we brought you here today?"
No, I honestly don't sir
Respond in heavy 'ebonics' "BECAUSE IM BLACK?!"
xDDDD
So when will you be doing this? This weekend?
Yeah, right now I'm just creating drone accounts
I'll start the actual attack tomorrow
alright. Record her talking again xD
I'm not attacking that teacher, I'd never do anything to fuck with that teacher
This is some random english class
Well, some random english teacher
But tomorrow is my last day of school
So I won't hear anything about this until next school year
noooooo
oh lol
unless you get a letter ;)
Well...
They would never do that xD
Also, even if they got my IP (Which they won't, I'm doing this behind tor) there ain't jack shit they can do with it
This is perfectly legal.
Viperidae: not *really*
Yeah it is
One could construe it under the same sort of classification DDoS falls under
Nah
At the very least it violates Edmodo's terms of service
So Edmodo might actually have a legal case with you
Although I'm sure they wouldn't care
Which I don't care about, violating a TOS isn't illegal (In the sense of a criminal case). They could only file a civil lawsuit which I really don't give a shit about, and my IP is masked.
Yup
Now did you type any of this on IRC from a school computer?
Because the keyl0ggers are real
My school doesn't have keyloggers
(I've analyses their systems several times).
*analysed
Now I will go pick up dinner
You made me hungry.
TheBrokenKeeper you here?
splitty_: Yes, I am now
I was playing some CS:GO
Nullz: I'm planning on implementing a map renderer in Python for my engine
You play csgo? What rank/.
Rank 2...
I'm a noob
Just started playing again two days ago
nice
Last time I played, ranks didn't exist
TheBrokenKeeper, can you test the new Hashlecter with libnotify.net support in a few minutes?
I don't know how, but sure :D
:D
Thanks
Silver 2?
Private 2
Oh lol that rank does matter xD I mean competitive rank? http://gyazo.com/7565189c02f50e0fcb101fb8bd59a149
doesnt*
0
I'm shit at competitive
I don't recommend getting into it
It'll take all the fun out of the game
I quit playing it because of that. I was nova 3(not to high but not noob level), you literally have to practice and write notes on stuff about that game and at that point it wasn't fun for me.
Interesting
Woo! 500 accounts
Nice
I wonder if the teacher noticed
And if so, I wonder what the hell she's thinking
Nullz: Is it weird that I'm going to make most of my game in Python?
For some reason I love Python... And instead of making my game in C# like any sane person, I'm doing it in Python
game or game engine.
Game
The game engine is C# only
Oh, thats fine.
But it does support Python scripting
TheBrokenKeeper hashlecter works fine with libnotifynet :D
It's awesome
I don't even know what that library is, but cool!
:D
You'll see it soon
TheBrokenKeeper: http://www.xup.in/dl,39685461/hashlecter_libnotifynet.zip/
First run lecter -g -i Test >hash.txt
This will generate a file called hash.txt with the md5 hash of the word "Test"
Then bruteforce it using lecter -i hash.txt --incremental -a $u$l
Please tell me if the desktop notifications work :D
Unhandled Exception: System.DllNotFoundException: Unable to load DLL 'SQLite.Int
erop.dll': The specified module could not be found. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8
007007E)
oooh
Wait
http://www.xup.in/dl,74292601/SQLite.Interop.dll/
splitty_: Unhandled Exception: System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException: Specified argument was
out of the range of valid values.
Parameter name: Parameter of argument -a is out of range.
wtf
How did you call lecter?
./lecter.exe -i hash.txt --incremental -a $u$l
I'm using git bash
Oh
Aka Mingw32
Use the cmd
Why?
It worked to generate it
dafuq
There was a exception but it still worked?
No
...
This is cracking it, it doesn't work
But it worked to generate the hash
That's fucked up
It works
It just doesn't work with git bash
wtf
It works with the cmd
git bash seems to fuck up the arguments
splitty_: ./lecter.exe -i hash.txt --incremental -a abcTdefsuvt
This runs
But $u$l doesn't
OH I KNOW WHY..
git bash thinks $ is an variable identifier
\$u$\l works
\$u\$l *
So
This is so fucking slow to do with $u$l
./lecter -i hash.txt --incremental -a \$u\$l
Yeah it uses the full upper and lowercase alphabet
Speed  : 88870 hash/s
Max    : 282904 hash/s
Total  : 2579796 hashes
Is that fast or slow as balls?
dafuq
My bot is now creating accounts every 5 secomds
*seconds
TheBrokenKeeper that speed is okay. It does 103.000/s on my pc
lol Viperidae what are you doing
Interesting
Well..
TheBrokenKeeper, do you like the desktop notifications?
I'm not sure if I should keep them
Yup
They are nice
And look a lot like nVidia's
Okay thanks :D
lol
18:00 <Viperidae> Nullz, you know what Edmodo is?
18:00 <Nullz> No?
18:01 <Nullz> Its like a tutor?
18:01 <Viperidae> Lolno
lel
Only saw 4 lines
See http://pastebin.com/p3Z8RLty
LOL
You could bruteforce the codes and kick everyone else out
Oh my god
Reagan!
Are you there!
What?
We must begin the attack immediately
xDDD
What the hell happened?
Let me start tor
You are requesting to join: English 12 Honors Summer 2015
You have requested to join this group. The owner of this group must approve your request.
Lol continue to bombard the teaccher with emails
^
Let me start the pr0nz
I'll send you a list of accounts
Can you PM teachers or post publically
I'll be sleeping, brb, going onto Linux for logs
You can post publically
kk goodnight
Night
Viperidae: how to post publicly
Click on the group
k
"Type your note here"?
Then ah
&Yeah
*Yeah
I'll prank my sister. That prank will hurt like hell. xD
Viperidae: I am including a link to pornhub
With the message "I found this website educational"
Have you ever heard of a pepper called "Carolina Reaper"?
It has 2 million+ scoville
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Reaper
I'm back
But I'll be sleeping
kk
So good night or day or morning or afternoon or evening or whatever every body :D
Goodnight :D
night
Victory!
Me and Reagan got it shut down
This is a glorious day!
_1
Good job.
Since tomorrow is the last day of school, there is NO way the teacher can communicate an alternative assignment to rising 12th graders
Reagan: She might try to bring it back online later, not sure
LOL
Wow, it's still possible to PM her actually
Aviv, the teacher deleted that group xD
Every single year in high school I always started off with a big 0 in english for not doing the summer assignment
Not this year!
I, GruntTheDivine! Have defeated the tyranny within the English Department!
I would argue 0 isn't a big number.
But okay :p
Good job! *everyone claps*
xD
I'm debating whether or not I should say anything to the teacher
Like, a warning that any attempt to reassign a summer assignment will result in another such attack
Don't
I wouldn't
Good Job, I guess
Not in person
Lol not in person
I mean via Edmodo
lol
Well, you are partially evil
so
WHY NOT?
Well, Aviv I don't think what I'm doing is evil
How so?
One day Aviv, you will be infected with this thing called "Fucking shit m8" and it'll make you want to do things you were told not to do, and its really hard to not do them.
Don't think so
I don't see any reason why I should have to do jack shit during the time when I'm NOT in school
I'm fighting for my right to do nothing over the summer! Viva la revolution!
KK

I have replying implemented in TelBoard, which in my opinion makes it usable
kk
You should try it out
Let's see if having a conversation over TelBoard works
You start a Tel
Are you  Kostas as Kostas?
Goddamn it!
Somehow replying is broken
The replying does not work.
And no, I'm not Kostas.
Motherchode!
Hey TheBrokenKeeper, sorry I was busy.
Found vulnerability in Tel, [Mobile]Reagan.
It's luckily not a stored XSS.

Hi sexyjester Viperidae bacon napoleon sexyjester TheBrokenKeeper
Hello.

Hey Ichiru.
I'm going to try and get very simple vector drawing into my game
niche
it'd be nice to be able to have some dynamically scaled ui elements
once i bother adding in rotation
I should have (all flat shaded :( )
rectangles, lines and circles
#die
So Aurora01, did you here my mission was successful?
The group was closed
Well, to be fair, you'll probably just be given a good old paper copy of the work
Surely?
Today is the last day of school
There is no way they could communicate with everyone after today
Guess who's getting drunk tonight
Don't you have mailboxes and the postal service/
*?
Yeah, they wouldn't utilize that though.
In other news, someone has randomly forked Descant
We must be popular xD
Dayum, who
?
https://github.com/wnda/descant
That guy
Get forked m8
^
I need a nickname for Descant v0.1.0
Hymn \
How does Reagan's versioning system work for TelBoard by the way?
Aviv and I have spent a month making Descant v0.1, and he's already at TelBoard v1.2
xD
Aurora01: How did you say I would read a [[(0, 1), (1, 3), (0,0)],[(0, 1), (1, 3), (0,0)]] file in Python
?
f = open('file.json')
data = json.loads(f.read())
That's json?
Well, it'd be easier to format it as JSON
How would an array in JSON look like?
I'll pastebin it
http://pastebin.com/r0jDzVAH
I need a 2D array of tuples
Can those inner arrays become tuples?
tuple(inner_list)
Umn... that's not good
What's wrong with it?
I'm going to have hundreds of those
256*256 tuples
And?
Minimum
Is JSON the best format then?
And tuple(u, v) doesn't look great for however many of those is
Don't think so
I need a better format
Perhaps you should write your own compact format
I'm not the best :(
I mean, I have no idea how to parse it
Test it first though
Test if JSON works
Though honestly some sort of CSV file would be better
Aurora01: Seems like I forgot to add the search paths for default Python modules
Fuck..
I don't have json
I'm too lazy to add json
And what I need to do is store a map
Which will hold an array of arrays of tuples
And I need to do that without starting Visual Studio, I'm too lazy
I can only work in pure Python, no external modules
Descant v0.1.0 is out
https://github.com/Aurora0000/descant/releases/tag/v0.1.0
Download it, get vagrant and docker, and install simply by typing:
vagrant up
Aurora01: What about making a PyTileMap serializer?
That could work
You do that
And I'll take all the credits
Deal?
Sounds perfect :P
Well, anyway, I'll have a job for you soon
I'm on Winblows
Start translating Descant to Romanian/any other languages you know.
I only know English, Romanian, C#, Java, C/C++, Python, so on and so forth
But I also have a job for you, start making that serialzer
Well, you know English virtually perfectly, and I hope you know Romanian just as well.
I don't know how to translate
Now, give me the json file with all the things
Step 1: Look at English word
All the localization things
Aurora01: Was I disconnected?
TheBrokenKeeper, how would you translate 'Tags' to Romanian?
splitty_, you here?
yeah
Just came home
How would you translate 'Tags' to German?
Aurora01:
'Tags' = 'Etichete'
Excellent, thanks a lot.
Aurora01, Etikette would be the translation but Tags seems more appropriate.
All germans will understand it.
So using 'Etikette' would be less well-understood?
Oh, and could you both provide translations for this table?
https://github.com/wildlyinaccurate/angular-relative-date#translation-keys
Aurora01: I guess you can't provide a table like thing for me? I have some work to do but I can find space for translating
Well, I'll create a JSON-formatted file, so you just fill in the blanks
Yay :D
And I really appreciate the help
Then you can use Descant in Romanian, if you so desire :D
NEVER!
I've never used any software in Romanian
Even when I was two and a half years old I still used them in English
Aurora01: {{time}} from now would mean how much time in the future, right?
Yeah
It'll be a number
Like 3 days ago
Etc
Yup
I'll push the JSON files in a second
https://github.com/Aurora0000/descant/blob/v0.2-devel/static/descant/translations/lang-en.json there you go
Copy the time ones into lang-ro.json and translate when you have time
Okay
How would I go about doing things?
I forgot how to do pull requests and such
If you like, just pastebin your changes
How to do the pull requests?
Is it just a fork?
Just fork it and then click pull request
Okay
.
Aurora01: How to clone a branch?
Or how to switch to that v0.2-devel branch?
git clone -b v0.2-devel <url>
Or if you already have the code
git checkout v0.2-devel
That was easy :D
Git is easy :P
Aurora01: Umn... something like {{seconds}} ago, would something like "with x seconds ago" work as a thing?
As Romanian kinda requires the first part
Wait, no
Scratch that
I was just an idiot
Well, it will probably be written as "posted {whatever}"
If that helps
Or "edited {whatever}"
Yup, the with part is required for that
Aurora01: Romanian localization is quirky
That's weird
We have an extra word between the number and seconds(example), if the number is bigger than 10
So, I'll use the one that sounds better
Wow, that's irritating.
Aurora01: If I commit, will it do the current branch?
Aurora01, Etikette is used for multiple things. Tags is better.
splitty_: Okay
TheBrokenKeeper: it doesn't really matter, it matters where you push to
git push origin v0.2-devel
Aurora01: Pull request made
Yay :D
How to see how bad it looks?
I'll update the server in a minute
Okay
http://django-descant.rhcloud.com/static/descant/#/topics
It should auto-detect Romanian as your language if your browser has the setting
It doesn't :D
Well, I don't have a manual language choice yet
splitty_: Take a look at the beginning of this, you'll die from how tangled it is: https://github.com/chronium/ChronoScript/network
That code is just an explosion, TheBrokenKeeper.
Yup
TheBrokenKeeper: if you want to test it, go to chrome://settings/languages
Assuming you're using chrome
Then add Romanian, drag it to the top
Then refresh descant
Aurora01: Where's the locale for posted and such?
Not implemented yet.
Will do it soon
Lazy...
But it works
I'M NOT
I WAS WRITING THE FRENCH TRANSLATIONS
IT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE I BARELY KNOW FRENCH
You know more than me
I did over 4 years of french
I have no idea how to say my own name
I'll be doing the gaming now
Don't mind my chinese-like grammar
TheBrokenKeeper, POSTED and REPLIES locales are available
To translate whenever you have time
Night
bacon, wait
We need Australian translations
:P
Aurora01
Yes?
What are the "seconds/minutes/... from now" translations for? o_0
http://django-descant.rhcloud.com/static/descant/#/
Take a look at the times
Oh
Sorry
I misunderstood
They're just part of the library I use
Oh okay
Leave them blank if you can't be bothered
Or just delete the entry
Then it'll default to English for those values
I translated them
Just seemed weird to me
I've added some more keys now, if you'd be able to help
You will all get prominent crediting for this, obviously, because it's not an easy job and it's very helpful to me.
Aurora01 https://github.com/Aurora0000/descant/pull/16
Thanks, splitty__
Uhm Aurora01
I have a weird problem xD
Yeah?
I just saw that you added some new keys to the translations
So I edited the german translation
But the pull request looks weird. (didn't send it yet)
It changed files like topic-firstpost.html and stuff
Send it anyway, see what happens
I can always reject it if it goes wrong
Wait I'll see if I can sync with you
You may as well do your translations in batches because I've still got a reasonable amount that needs localising.
Perfect
Fixed it
https://github.com/Aurora0000/descant/pull/17
yay
Hello Cameron!
Welcome to #int0x10, aka translatedescant.com
Hey Cameron
Wat r beans
Hallo people
Hallo Aurora
Hallo Splitty
:D
translatedescant.com not actual website 0/10
Donate, and it could be real
Where r money hole
donatedescant.com
Aurora01: Can you remind me tomorrow to translate the rest?
Sure
Not real website 0/10 cannae have my moolah
Hi!
Hey
Hello, Aviv.
splitty__, more translation keys if you want
Hi!
nice
Aurora01: https://github.com/Aurora0000/descant/pull/18
Merged
Awesome
I'll translate some more tomorrow, currently. I can't be bothered, I'm too tired
Alright, this commit that I've done now should be the last of it
:P
Oh, hold on
1 more thing
Then it'll be done
Will you guys be here for me on my b-day? In 12 days?
If you want I will give everyone a photo of a cake slice :D
You can give me money as presents, I take everything you give :D
Isn't it a bit early?
Well, a fortnight is two weeks.
So no, it's fine
Okay...
Assuming your birthday is at the end of your birth-fortnight.
Maybe
It will be in a Wednesday
Aurora01: https://github.com/Aurora0000/descant/pull/19
Merged
Translating is fun :)
Well, when we add more features, you'll be needed again
splitty__: Too many Rammstein references. "Du hast" is copyrighted...
xDDDD
Du hast means "you have"
Nice
Now... why is German so fucking hard?
There's no such thing as too many Rammstein references
+1
http://9gag.com/gag/avZnw5E
Aurora01, Brackets makes stuff easier
http://puu.sh/impPC/3e8eea64ff.png
Brackets <3
Haha
Brackets just explodes when I try it
lel
I dislike Brackets. I either use Sublime Text or a special tool from JetBrains
It didn't let me open the german version because it was ANSI encoded
I converted it to UTF-8 and now it works fine
TheBrokenKeeper why do you dislike Brackets? It's awesoe
I don't know
I don't have any reason
Descant now fully supports French and German
Partially supports Romanian
Give me 10 minutes
splitty__, is your browser set to use German?
If so, look at http://django-descant.rhcloud.com/static/descant/#/
Aurora01: How can I pull the changes from the branch
?
From your fork?
Yes
Aurora01 you're trying to access lang-de_DE.json
But the file name is lang_de.json
Give me a minute
Also, I think lang_de-DE.json is better than lang-de_DE.json
Well, I don't really get a choice in the matter, the browser sends it the other way
(de_DE)
oh okay
I thought it was de-DE
Aurora01: Help, please?
Depends on which standard you follow
TheBrokenKeeper: oh, sorry
https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/
Doesn't help :(
TheBrokenKeeper did you add the upstream remote?
Nope
wow.
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin <url_of_your_fork>
git remote add upstream <url_of_auroras_descant>
http://django-descant.rhcloud.com/static/descant/#/topics splitty__
Check if everything is right using git branch
git remote*
You can sync the changes using
git checkout v0.2-devel
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/v0.2-devel
Do a simple git push after that to push the changes to your origin
splitty__, the German translation looks awesom
Aurora01: Nice. The New Topic button doesn't seem to work tho
*awesome
Wait
Really?
Thank you, and yeah :D
It still says New Topic
And I did a cache reload
Oh Aurora01 I think you misunderstood me
Sorry I should have been more clear
Ah, I see what you mean now
Aurora01: That "POSTED" key, what does it exactly mean?
Is it like the reply when you post something?
Or the posted things?
It's used in posted <whenever>
splitty__, I'm not sure why it isn't working.
I can reproduce the issue though, which is good.
Found the issue
The text that wasn't translated was on a really long line
Which was overflowing so I couldn't see it
Ah okay
Fixed it now splitty__
http://django-descant.rhcloud.com/static/descant/#/topics
Nice!
Hi
Aurora01
Aurora01: https://github.com/Aurora0000/descant/pull/20
Hello NikxDa
Can you please set up something where I can test my CSS changes to Descant immediately?
I want to design a whole new theme and I'm not willing to make a pull request for every single px change so I can see the changes
Hmm, I'm not sure what the best way to do that is
Here are the choices:
Me neither, ask splitty__ he says he knows
a) Fork it, and when that's done, pull request it
b) I give you write access
a) No method to see changes immediately
b) Okay
With either method, you'd need to have a local web server or something
The server that we use is just periodically updated manually.
I'm on OSX right now, I have a server on nikx.io tho
Aurora01: When you have time, will you write for me a map serializer? Which uses no external moduleS? I'm too lazy to link them?
I could theoretically just upload descant to my server
And change stuff there
But I have know idea how your system works
Databases?
You can just upload the frontend code
fron static/descant
And the REST API will still contact the main server
How can I see it then?
Just copy all code from static/descant on to your server
You'd need to implement a method to change the CSS origin then
Why?
If I upload just the CSS
How will your server use it then
Well, it wouldn't work if you just did that.
Or do I understand somethign wrong
NikxDa you upload the CSS and HTML code.
The HTML and the API are totally separate
https://github.com/Aurora0000/descant/tree/v0.2-devel/static
You don't have to have them on the same server or anything
git clone v0.2-devel https://github.com/Aurora0000/descant.git
cd descant
oooooh
I get it now
So your local HTML copy will still connect to my server
mv descant/static /path/to/your/webserver/descant
So I can just run Descant on my server and it will still fetch the data from Auroras server
And do all the python-y stuff
Correct?
Yes.
Exactly.
Just tell me that in the beginning :D
Thanks
Sorry, I should explain better
He did...
:P
I wasn't particularly clear, to be fair
I may have gotten him wrong there
Well, true
Still thanks
Anyway, I've got to go now.
Will work on that tonight 4 sure
Have a nice evening
Or whatever time it is at yours
Good night, NikxDa.
Good night Aurora01
Night splitty__
Night!
Night everyone else who hasn't received a special 'night'
:P
So everyone whose username starts with "A" just happened to bugger off at the same time
Except good old AndroUser2
lel
Hey iNTERNAL
hey @all
Who is _InTERNAL?
I know like nobody anymore except bacon
Everyone from the old GeckoFX/Devatan days have vanished from the lands of IRC
Cameron,  well,  I was on tdf
So was I
So there's that
So was I
I suppose that's far back enough
But still fairly recent
I first joined TDF in 2012 but...
I guess that's recent xD
Aye but GeckoFX/Devatan you're talking like 2010/11 :D
Surprisingly, I knew IntelloTech before I knew any of you.
Ah now that's a blast from the past
How's he doing these days?
Still playing supervillain?
No clue xDDD
But not quite as supervillain as Softwerx
I came across him on Youtube a very long time ago and talked to him briefly via PM on Youtube I think
Then years later bacon told me about how he haxoredeszed Devatan
I hacked a local wifi hotspot tday
Yeah there was a lot of drama about that
This is history!
Idk if you heard about Softwerx though?
People, you need to write about the old history
Me? I only heard of him, don't know any details
Nah, but how are they playing 'Supervillian'?
But still
He was some proper massive troll on the GeckoFX forums
Always trying to sell his own "fork" of the software, MozNet, which seems to still be around http://se7en-soft.com/software/moznet/modern.aspx
I play supervillian with the communities that Aviv has descended from
Get together on a document and write the freaking history. NOW!
I just remember the days where Devatan would disappear and get replaced by some evil message from IntelloTech and we'd all go on the IRC and panic
http://osnetwork.ga/
"MUHAHAHA! I HAVE YOUR PASSWORDS!"
(I swear I had *nothing* to do with that xD)
But they were all just MD5 hashes
Well Cameron
Experiments conducted by Splitty_ and Reagan confirm that with every database there ought to be hashes vulnerable to a dictionary attack.
Liking the h4x page there
For a while I couldn't be bothered to join int0x10 because I was sick to death of switching forums
There had been something like the GeckoFX forums, about 3 incarnations of DevAtan, TDF and the devvers subreddit and by the time int0x10 surfaced I was just like for GOD'S SAKE
Then Rob (Proto) tweeted me and told me to join so I had to because Rob gives me bumsex
TIL
Hahahaha, I was never in DevAtan sadlt, just TDF but I kind of wanted to create a TDF-esque community,
#TIL indeed
I miss the old days, I wasn't active on the frums but I was sorta active on the IRC
Same ^
I can give a lot of TIL if I wrote that document I'm being told to write
Unfortunately I have useful things to do
This man is a legend http://consequenceofsound.net/2015/06/dave-grohl-breaks-leg-after-falling-off-stage-in-sweden-finishes-concert-anyway/
TheBrokenKeeper: Did Reagan leave yet?
Don't think so
Ok, he said he will be going to Jesus camp soon for like 3 weeks
LOL so I just sent that teacher an email
Hello, Edmodo is giving me an error message that says "Invalid code" when adding the code ww9p4f for the 12 Honors summer assignment. The paper my english teacher handed me says that it will expire in two weeks, but the letter was only printed on June 5th. Can you reset the code?
Thanks,
Thomas.
Awesome!
wtf Viperidae
Jesus camp?
Sounds bad.
Yeah
What the hell is a jesus camp
His church is going on a 3 week camping trip
oh wow
If only the church of satan offered something like that..
Jesus camp?
Sounds like somewhere you'd get touched up if you're under 16
xd
If only aliens would come to evolve us...
^
No one say anything, but I think Reagan is starting to have trouble with his faith.
Viperidae the descant network graph looks really weird :D
http://puu.sh/imv1w/862dcb65a9.png
Stick the Underground logo on that and you've got yourselves a map
splitty__: Mine is even worse...
^^
Well not really
It's just more tangles
tangled*
Lol
Wow it indeed works

TheBrokenKeeper you should get the game Mini Metro
xD
I know it, I don't have the money for games currently
I'm currently CS:GOing all day long
lel
I've been playing Counter-Strike since I was 9
I am still hopelessly terrible at it
Aviv fucked Descant up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6RmNM3X0M
I'm impressed with how he managed to make css THIS messy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQK00RM3JsI
I laughed so hard
:D
Some premature ejaculation right there
I'm so sorry
I still had to laugh
We might still be able to meet someday to sexually stimulate our genitals for sexual arousal until orgasm together.
You sound like one of the people on this Twitter profile https://twitter.com/PornComnents
I am - once again - really sorry
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmxAcVvAO40
I have a 6m USB cable but nothing like that good lawd
Not bad
I've always wanted my PC in the back alley
I have something 6m long too.
))
Well he sounds like one of the guys from "PornComments"
;)
xD
(I think)
(It's Splitty's penis)
;);)
Why the LISP notation tho
xD
Because he's cool
(I am too)
:)
I think I'm not making friends here right now. Gotta go work on Descant before more people come and see me like that
I behave like that and don't work on Descant at all and I have plenty of friends :D
But then... I have HISTORY
xD
xD
Hey Aviv
Hey splittywitty
There is someone who wants to talk to you ;)
ooh
Who who who?
Is it
NikxDa?
WHO IS IT splitty__????
Is it Money Boy?
NikxDa. xD
AVIV
You fucked Descant up
HOW!?
You're still asking lol?
class="box list-list"
Uhm
Okay?
<post-list>
http://cssguidelin.es
Read
Learn
I didn't do the <post-list> things
Repeat
lol I don't care about someone's guidelines as long as I'm following the real standard
You're not
The site above combines all relevant Guidelines
e.g. BEM naming convention
Most important I'd say
â¢four (4) space indents, no tabs; already left
Then how to properly use classes
tabs are better
No
No they are not
They are.
not
Tabs are interpreted differently by every ide / editor
The standard notepad for example uses 8 spaces per tab
This makes HTML which uses tabs unreadable
lol
So if you use 4 spaces, you get the most "same" experience overall
NikxDa: that site is ridiculous
That site is awesome
At least I'd say so
Just read and decide for yourself
Ok
My projects mostly have followed those rules and they work nicely
Sure
Reagan wtf
lel
Aviv, I'll do a redesign and I'll rework the css
Keep track: http://exp.nikx.io/Descant/descant
lol k
I have been meaning to redesign it a bit
Your use of classes is awful :I
Thanks.
More examples?
I'll be gaming now :D
I didn't do all the fake elements, that was Aurora, btw
Sorry? Not meant bad, just saying. The examples are basically everywhere. You just name them how it comes to your mind it seems
e.g.
If you have list-item
you should first have a list
<ul class="list">
<li class="list__item">
/BEM naming
Block__Element--modifier
no.
So you can easily do the following then
There's a reason I've never seen that naming convention anywhere before...
class="list__item list__item--error"
It's awesome
Not.
Why not
Explain
It's just not needed
The only thing that matters about a CSS class is if it gets the idea of what it is for across
and that's going overboard
Well if you do it like you are currently, you will end up like MS in their sources and use shitty classes because the normal classes with the proper name are already used and not written reusable
k
I've worked with guidelines and without, you should try too
Anyway, time to restart for trackpad drivers, woo!
Ask splitty__, he can prove me right
No thanks
Well
D
That escalated quickly
dafuq
hi splitty__
What's wrong?
hehehe beans
Reagan: have you asked NikxDa for help with Tel since NikxDa is just oh so good with CSS?
Hi Cameron!

Viperidae: methinks those videos are fake/satire
No it isn't.
Also
In actual true Islam that woman wouldn't be out on her own shopping without her husband
LOL no
This is an Indonesian children series
Called Anak Islam
Yeah...
That's Islamic law :P
She's with her son..
The apple scene?
Also: TelBoard github is updated
Viperidae: check this out: http://misiriansoft.com/tel/users.php
I do hope you understand that not all muslims oppress women like not all christians oppress women, despite the fact that both holybooks are sexist as hell
Dammit I had a list of bible verses ready for his response to that
Someone remember this if this comes up again
Corinthians 11:7
Corinthians 14:34
Ephesians 5:22
Timothy 2:9
Colossians 3:18
Aviv
I never said I was good, I just said you should use those Guidelines because I do think your CSS sucks
Hurtful ;'(
It works.
I might still be wrong but it's my personal opinion
Ye mine doesnt
Can you help me rly quick?
Viperidae: back
Also I think my DE broke
I'm trying to replace those <nav-btn> Elements but I honestly have no idea of Angular and I can't find where they are used
Aviv
Anyways, that Islam video is legit
wooo <3 Islam
I can click on anything except for the "applications" thing at the top
lol yeah I've tried too, NikxDa
I asked Aurora to remove them but he refused xD
I found the directive but I do not understand why it refuses to load the content into <li> Elements as soon as I change it
Weird stuff going on there
lol
yeah
Viperidae: you see the users.php
gotta hate JS
Yes
Yes
And the user profile like thing
You can click on users in that list
Messages this user has posted:
Nothing
Or click on their posts
xD
Viperidae: which user
Jacob
lol Viperidae
lelwut
I honestly want to rework the thing but I cannot do it with those elements being there
Infact
sad isn't it, NikxDa
I clicked on the link
My brain refuses to work on something this "wrong"
And it redirected to http://misiriansoft.com/tel/do-user.php?user=
;P
With ho user specified
lol
Viperidae: http://misiriansoft.com/tel/do-user.php?user=Jacob
ho user?
Aviv, please help
:D
Search w/ me
I can't, I don't know how either lol
Reagan: I am capable of figuring that out, but you should use user IDs instead of usernames
Viperidae: click this link: http://misiriansoft.com/tel/users.php
It is apparently because of the templates
Any Angular-Wizards here?
Viperidae: so right
Nope
Oh shit
The thing is broken in the users list
And nothing on users.php links to any valid profiles xD
Well click on usernames in board.php
Aviv btw
It'd be nice if you at least took a look at class grouping
I admit BEM is a thing of preferrence
But class grouping is actually useful
Viperidae: fixed it: http://misiriansoft.com/tel/users.php
btw those tables look really ugly
You can see my tables?
Oh
Tengo que ir
Although I do like how they worked out with replying and such
How they group together for a conversation
Just write some CSS to make them look good

whoops
I am terrible at CSS
Everything I try and do ends up looking like the 80s

Hi Thomas,
Thanks for contacting me.  I had some technical difficulties with Edmodo and will be putting the summer assignment on the Kellam website by July 1.  If something changes with Edmodo, the website will contain that information.   Please share this change with any other rising seniors you know who will be taking 12 Honors.  Again, the summer assignment will be posted on the Kellam website by July 1.

Gonna attack again on july 1?
Yeah, I already won though xD I don't think the word will get out, so no one will do it (And if barely anyone does it, then they won't grade it)
Good job! :D
That weird moment when you make a shit ton of changes to your code, and except the compilation to fail when yous see "Project Built 100%, Build Successful"
LOL
I never trust that
Like I am always worried about a logical error then
The happened to me before. Wish I recorded what happened.
Oh?
The thing is, the IDE I'm using isn't as helpful as VS in pointing out errors on the fly, so it's possible to make a simple mistake and not notice until you actually hit compile (VS would underline an error in red)
Yeah monodevelop is that way as well
Also
Back when I used to use mono
*nano
Well..
I would say Monodevelop is friendlier
Also Jacob
I would compile and gmcs would give me more errors than could fit on the terminal screen
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; must be annoying as shit
What version of mono are you using?
IDK
Why?
because I realized the other day I've been using a REALLY old version of Mono, and the fedora repos didn't have the latest version.
I upgraded my Mono, and reinstalled the latest version of MonoDevelop and I'm amazed with how nice it is
Oh
Compared to the older version
How is the new mono any better :P
The older mono had some bugs with SSL certificates with System.Net. It was preventing my SpamBot from working
Oh lel
Is this what your Monodevelop looks like https://youtu.be/VrWlq8L5jiE?t=138 (Ignore the editor colors, I did that on purpose)
This is what the latest version looks like http://www.monodevelop.com/images/390-ss-debugger-5-4.png btw

Just Pmd it to you
Anyways
Do you have that version of mono?
(The old one)
Jacob, did you have that version of MonoDevelop?
WEll
On this shittop I do
Ah, but the dongtop?
But on the dongtop I have the new good
version
Noice
I think anyways
I'm not sure
I wish there was some easy way to do file associates in Linux so I don't have to do iodine myFile.irx
For irx files (I could just use shebang for plain Iodine source files, but I can't for irx)
Should Iodine drop an IRX file when ever I run a program?
Whst is IRX?
It's a compiled Iodine program
^ +1
Oh
If I ran a plain Iodine file, I could make it drop an irx then next time if the irx is newer than the original program, it will not compile the original source code (As it already has done this) and just run the irx
I'd be good because if I run the same script more than once, it doesn't have to be compiled each time
But the bad thing would be Iodine would be dropping IRX files every time a program gets ran
aw why?
?
Nullz: Why what?
Why'd he leave
Well
He could have heard his parents coming
Or had to restart
Or he just went, but it would out of character for him not to say bye
oh yeah I forgot about his parents.
lol
I didn't even notice smuxi quit
I think it was because smuxi runs with mono
And I had to run a killall mono
Yeah, Smuxi was written in C#
Noice!
#C#Power
I haven't been using C# for big projects xD
shh
C# for life..
I...agree-ish
Lol I was just joking
Well it's not a bad language
C# is great but it can't do everything
Well
C# isn't good for writing critical code, and the other problem with C# is it being dependent on an implementation of the CLR. That isn't too much of a problem on Windows, as .NET is installed on most Windows machines; but it is with Linux which requires Mono (And C# programs have to be invoked with the mono command as well).
Viperidae: linux associates exe files with mono
If they are chmoded
You can just do ./myprogram.exe
It will requires mono to be installed though
*Still
That's the problem, it has dependencies. And big ones too.
Meh
It's an extra 128mb on my system
I don't mind it
I don't either, but it's stupid to release programs that require it. C# would be a horrible language to write Iodine in
I won't be using only C# forever, I'm gonna expand to C# and C soon.
^
+!
shit
The thing is, to choose a language that's appropriate for what ever project you are working on. C# isn't suitable for writing an efficient cross platform programming language interpreter, which is why Iodine is being written in C++
How hard is it to do GUI things in C or C++?
Honestly
I've never done any GUI stuff in C or C++ xD
Doing a GUI with the Win32 API is a bitch
It's terrible napoleon
*Nullz
hmm. What about libraries?
If you use a wrapper though, like GTK then it isn't that bad
Errr Viperidae I disagree
Oh cool :D
Even GTK with monodevelop is overly shitty
You can't just drag and drop a button
Jacob, first off that's a problem with an IDE
You have to make these weird ass wrappers
Have you ever done any GUI code with GTK WITHOUT an IDE?
and I mean pure GTK code, not a C# mono wrapper for GTK
Hell no
Never!
Then you can't speak on this xD
I'm sorry, but the GUI designer is bad feature for VS for new programmers
I dont care about drag and drop. If I can just do GUI.AddControl(new Button(75,25,"Click Me", void ClickEvent)); with a library, that'd be cool.
If you throw a basic text editor at some novice C#/VB developers and ask them to create a GUI program, they would be clueless on what to do XD
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwST7leB0Sc
Wow look at this guy's setup ^
Already seen it
Viperidae: check it out
Hello, World in C for GTK http://pastebin.com/T8Sz8fys
>>Creates Wrapper around GTK
GTK isn't that bad, you just have to learn how to use it. It's really just as simple as C#; it's just the C language doesn't have stuff like objects, static classes, ect so you have to do things a bit differently than in C#
Yeah and, I have more than enough resources to learn both C and C++ now :D
The best way to learn any language imo is just by trying some projects in it
(Of course, you should read about the language first)
And now that I know about its as easy to just do remove or whatever it was for memory management and that the weird *'s or whatever do(pointer/reference in that area) it doesnt look as scary
Hi!
Hello.
Pointers are really essential, I happened to know alot about them ever since before I started working with C. The reason being because I wrote VMs, and knew alot about assembly
and hi Aviv
Hi
I love pointers
I always use them
The only reasons I was scared of learning C++/C was literally that *, memory management and GUI.
.css {
cursor: pointer;
}
:|
I made a pointer!
+1
That a CSS pointer, everyone!
Yeah, alot of the stuff I write doesn't require a GUI, so that part doesn't bother me
CSS is like C, but more advanced
Definately
A pointer is like a address to the same object in the stack(I believe stack) so I can have multiple ways of accessing the same thing without creating a copy of the object.
Thanks for agreeing
Aviv, sometimes its easy to mistake your intentional sarcastic with unintentional stupidity.
Exactly the plan
*sarcasm
oh
Yeah Nullz, except having pointers to things on the stack and passing them outside the current function is very dangerous. Objects (When using the 'new' keyword) are not allocated on the stack, they are allocated on the heap.
ps: css is so advanced that it doesn't even need functions
Python too aviv.
Really now?
yep... didnt even learn functions were a thing in my computer science class that did python.
def function_name():
^
lol it showed up as a frown face for me
Yay Iodine is object oriented and it doesn't even have classes!
*claps*
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
How does that even work?
http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18e9zns7m6pdngif/original.gif
Prototyping
I can just do
myObject = Object();
myObject.someValue = something;
That's...
awesome
myObject.someFunction = someFunction;
Oh shit awesome
now I just need to get my garbage collector working and refactor some more things
Your almost done?!?!!
No, I'm going to add classes and a standard libary
Right now I have the following
Objects (Function, Integer, Boolean, Tuple (Array), String)
Functions
If statement, while statement, return statement
Dynamic typing (Duck Typing)
Viperidae Aviv Nullz
?
I will be off to bed now
jacob: bye
Night
And I won't see you for three weeks
Goodnight Jacob! Have fun! Make the best out of it. (Get yourself laid?)
Yeah boi!!!
Yeah swap girls with your jesusness

*Nullz
:p
Viperidae: what?
Tell them if they have sex with you
Huh?
Tell them what?
Your father will put in a good word with his man, JC
It'll grant them 1,000 sheep
Like indulgences! Except for sex!
:O
:O
WEll
This concludes our fireside chat
This is your president, signing off
Or just rub there face with $100 untill they start sucking your dick
or a cross
Oh one more thing
Reagan
What
say its holy to have sex
Don't become like the Obama family and make these vacations a regular thing you here!
*hear
LOL
Goodbye gentlemen (this is actually really sad for me)
Aww
HWY
Goodbye old sport
:'(
U get teh fuq teh pussies
<3
So, what should be my GC threshold/
*?
30 seconds?
I don't think it works like that
e = mc2garbagecollector
I think most garbage collectors wait until you allocate a certain amount of data before kicking in
300 mb
1337mb
that might be a bit to much
1337kb
How about 1 GB?
Why not?
Because its good for a language to be able to work on a super low spec machine
So maybe in the future his language might be used to control a stoplight
Then 1 B
yes 1b
xD
That's a lot, right?
B = Billionbyte!
obviously
no but really probably 100kb
Gotta eat.
Bye Nullz
I'll probably make it kick in at 128 KB xD
Oh.
Or 128 billionbytes
which I guess are just gigabytes?
right...?
:|
no?
.
My mom just told me African Americans and Indians have privilege over whites.
That's a hairy subject area to get into
Lol does your mom happen to listen to Micheal Savage?
Theres an amount of truth to that..?
No country 100% all the time
Kind of, but also not kind of.
There are stupid things like affirmative action, race quotas, ect.
I just kinda laughed for a little bit.
Does your mom listen to Michael Savage?
No
Ah, ok my dad had The Savage Nation on the car and he was talking about that, and making really stupid generalizations like certain races hate America, ect
.
I hate it when people are truly racist.
Yeah
I might say "sup nigga" or something but I don't mean it in a racist way(i used to say that alot, but didnt mean it like that)
Of course
When its like "Dem damn black people! Coming ot america just to terrorist us!"
Thats dump :p
dumb*
so wyd?
I'm working on Iodine right now
Nice :D *remembers your doing the garbage collector* Hows that going?
That works :)
Hopefully I'll have a nice little working Iodine version next weekend
Hahaha, it's awesome how I can dynamically add functions to existing objects when ever I feel like it
I can do this http://pastebin.com/1dMx24tc
I know right thats amazing!
I can't wait until I have closures
That will be hard to implement though at runtime
*has no clue what that is*
Basically, I'll be able to do crazy stuff like http://pastebin.com/FznDc4cc
opps
bad http://pastebin.com/PUtPLws1
(Ignore that bad0
*)
Holy shit you type fast
But yeah I haven't learn about Lama yet
Lamba*
Basically
A lambda expression lets you dynamically define a function at runtime.
Nullz: Have you ever used Thread.Start() in C#?
I've only messed with threads in visual basic.
Same thing
You know how Thread.Start requires that you pass a function to it (Like Thread.Start(myFunction));
yes
In C#, using Lambda expressions instead of passing an already defined function you can do this
Thread.Start( () => {
while(true) {
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World");
}
});
That basically creates a function right then and there (This is called an anonymous function) that just does that while(true) { Console.WriteLine .... }
Oh, thats awesome.
That's also something called a closure. A closure is basically a function thats inside another function, that can access all the variables from the parent function.
I've spent the last six hours outside drinking sangria with my friend.
I'm gonna go to sleep :D
Noice!
Goodnight
Goodnight :D
.
I know
That's why I'll do header + content
Heya
Like pachets in TCP
Hella
Uhm, TBK it really isn't that hard to come up with something like NBT
I know
I don't think NBT is that special or either
*either
Are we talking about games? NBT tags suck
But when it comes to Notch and how poorly Minecraft is made...
You are crazy...
Splitty_ is?
Yes
Why :D
NBT is beautiful
hi splitty_
Not really
o_0
Hey Ichiru
Now, we are talking about how the hell I make a nice file format for my game engine to use for everything
I was thinking about some sort of file format then gzip it and change it's extension too
And do the same for resources like images and scripts
Unpack them at runtime
put it all in a big zip file :D
No.
Well, I could do that, but it'd be weird
quake 3 did it
splitty_: Want a quick nice project?
So did Binding of Isaac classic and Rebirth
Honestly, I'd look for more inspiration from formats like Halo's .map. From my experience as a Halo modder, that format is really logically sound and efficient. Of course if you've never done Halo modding then you probably have no idea what that format is like xD
Can someone with linux run this: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4843666/coreclr_game.tar.xz
You need SDL2 installed
I really don't want this to be only for the maps
I want it to be a general file for storing anything
From saves to a simple hello string
splitty_: Get your ass back here
uhm
What project?
why not just download a json library for C#
The Halo engine strings is a map file xD
*With the halo engine strings are a .map file
I don't want json, really, I do NOT want JSON
^
Fuck json
TheBrokenKeeper Newtonsoft.JSON is awesome
Or use CSON.
CSON is beautiful
Soo... splitty_... Wanna please make a custom compression system and such for me? Closed source please?
Closed source? Fuck you
No.
xP
No.
why would you make your own compression algorithm ._.
^
Not if it is closed source.
Security by obscurity never helped anyone.
666
What if you get 5% of the profit?
*^^^
x)
(To splitty, not TBK and his greedy self)
TheBrokenKeeper I'm not interested in money :D
so... did anyone click my link?
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4843666/coreclr_game.tar.xz < just need to see if it runs
it should give you a red screen
I really want something closed source in my engine. The content compiler thing HAS to be closed source
read up on the xnb file format
I don't want files to be decodable
That's why I want a custom format
TheBrokenKeeper: You are now an enemy of me
And closed source
TheBrokenKeeper: https://www.dropbox.com/s/p1qznthawvse2oc/XNB%20Format.docx?dl=0
I wan't it to be a first party format
lol Ichiru it can't find System.Console
Details won't be released
oh
In SDL2.Load
TheBrokenKeeper: Release source or specifications or die
splitty_ Copy everything in coreclr-linux to the main directory
TheBrokenKeeper, just use CSON or JSON. That's widely accepted.
I'm pretty sure I included System.Console.dll
The filenames are weird
Well then..
I didn't even do that
So
Yeah
xD
splitty_ It's Microsoft's CLR :P
lel
Did he really just rage quit?
Ichiru, another exception in BubbleEngine.Platform
FileLoadException: Can't find System.IO.FileSystem
:|
I copied everything
Is System.IO.FileSystem.dll in the directory?
yeah
TheBrokenKeeper: I will reverse any game you make and release an open source modding kit
xDD
odd
Viperidae, +1
the corefx libs are supposed to be platform independent
Yeah.
It's weird
Viperidae: You won't need to
As all my games will have open source modding kits
I'm no Mincraft
As the whole engine will be open source and for free, you know?
You just said you want to make the content compiler closed source
12:56 <TheBrokenKeeper> I really want something closed source in my engine. The content compiler thing HAS to be closed source
I will write an open source content compiler
Good job reverse engineering the format
splitty_ I guess I'll actually have to make a proper linux distribution of it
TheBrokenKeeper: Keeping that information proprietary is unethical
+ not just copy over the mac libs :P
And doing a disservice to your users.
And flat out evil
splitty_ run mono main.exe :P
Welcome back, NikxDa.
Viperidae: Tools to open the files, edit them and everything will be wide in the open
Even tools to decode the whole file and save it decoded
But I'm not sure on that idea
Also, this is my game engine, so I do what I want
I'm not forced to listen what someone tells me if I don't want to
Your game engine should be entirely open, and I will make it my MISSION to reverse engineer anything that isn't open; because I'm ethical
Well go ahead and do that with encrypted files
Your evil
If your going to do that
I'm sorry, but you are unethical and an enemy of the open source movement
Just because of you, decoding files will require a one-time use key from a server
Or, arguably, it's evil not to allow him to benefit from his own work
It's only your fault
Thank you Aurora
Viperidae, puttin two years of work into something and gaining nothing from it is not fun
As the engine will be FREE as in free beer for everyone
That means your a greedy capitalistic pig.
#Communism
I don't see a reason why I can't have something private
WE WILL TEAR DOWN YOUR TREACHEROUS BUREAUCRACY AND INSTATE A NEW ORDER IN THE NAME OF OUR BELOVED LEADER, KIM JUNG UN
Well, admittedly it's more convenient if the project is fully open so you can easily adjust stuff if it doesn't work well
lel
Everybody, int0x10 will now practice marxism
There
Glorious Leader Viperidae, for equality reasons we must give everyone operator status so that they are all equal
Or, remove operator status from everyone
+1
my dns keeps fucking up
Aurora01, the whole engine will be free, file formats will be encoded by the author. So copyrighted work will not be able to be freely sold around on the web
EQUALITY
FR
*FOR
ALL
!!!!!
How is banning me equality?
That was Ichiru
BLAME ICHIRU
Oh, true
Everyone is equal, I'm just a little more equal than all of the others
There we go
There, equality for all.
Better?
You were faster than me...
You guys need to learn when I'm being serious or not xD
hm
Although
I wonder how I should manage config
^^
I'll be honest with you, the difference between me being serious or not is sometimes hard to tell
xml is yucky
but json might be overkill
YAML?
for storing screen resolution
Ichiru take a look at CSON :D
I might just go key=value
https://github.com/bevry/cson
TheBrokenKeeper though, in all seriousness you don't have to have to hide the format. Just use some sort of cryptography that the developer using your engine would utilize to hide their shit
key=value is the hardest to fuck up
Each developer has there own key, ect. Security though obscurity is not security.
*their
and if the file does get fucked up I'll load sane defaults
Encryption with a one time use key generated by a server
Resolution: [ Width: '1920' Height: '1080' ]
Games released with the engine which want private resources will have to be registered to my server
This should be up to the developer though, this shouldn't be something you do to control all the people who use your engine
That would be unethical
splitty_: A user would probably fuck that up
If you want your resources to be private, just register your system
Viperidae that's what I told TheBrokenKeeper in a pm a few minutes ago lol
lol
I know
I might try cson for stuff that users aren't supposed to edit
To make provide a way to encrypt using a key
That's where I'm quoting from XD
-make*
Not quoting exactly
But still, the keys will be provided by my own server, one time use only
That's suboptimal
Forcing developers to use your server takes away a good amount of freedom(TM)
True, but I need a reason to steal 5% from their profits, don't I?
lol
Ichiru, I'll write a CSON-library
Isn't there already a C# library for it?
There has to be one
Nope there is just a CoffeeScript library
I found nothing matching "CSON" on the NuGet repo
:O
damn
var config = new KeyValueFile ("engine.config");
int width = int.Parse (config ["ResolutionWidth"]);
int height = int.Parse (config ["ResolutionHeight"]);
easiest config ever :P
Interesting
Ichiru: There is no reason to "steal" profits. Infact, if that is your intention that that's pretty evil. You should charge for commercial licenses, without stupid DRM to ensure they paid.
opps
+1
I meant TheBrokenKeeper
x)
and non commercial licenses should be free
I don't care about the way the person distributes it
My way of P/Invoke is pretty cool
Viperidae, the whole fucking engine is free
Can P/Invoke be cool?
xD
it can be
For commercial and non commercial...
This P/Invoke isn't compiled-in
But you are too ignorant to listen
lol
dlopen woo
Then what the hell is this bullshit with keeping some key to "steal profits"
You, as a game developer, pay $100k to a company to make you art assets
And some dick decides to release all of those for free
There goes your money
All the money you spent, all out there in the open
That is NOT how it works at all
But ok...
So the developer needs a way to secure their assets
Also, look at torrents
That's how it works
Look at all the game on the face of the planet, all the movies, all the everything
Everything is free for everyone
So please don't talk me about people following copyright rules and such
the games + movies that make millions of dollars?
(except that one that made $607 the opening weekend, that was hilarious)
^^^^
Cinemas and steam
If you make a good game, you'll make alot of money regardless if people pirate it or not
But this is a game engine
I need to provide a way for the user to encrypt their data if they want
Honestly, I don't even think that's necessary. If the game is popular, someone WILL reverse it. That is a fact
And by game I mean any game that uses your engine
And if you want to generate your own keys for assets, pay a small licensing fee for projects that have made a profit of over $3k
even with Steam
Ichiru, I currently have 3 Steam games torrented
So I know that they are easy to break
Even though I have 237 games, those 3 missing from 24
And you shouldn't have to pay to use your own assets, and any sane developer would just implement their own form of DRM instead of paying you
240 I need
You pay the licensing fee, I give you the server to generate your own keys
It's as easy as that
They should be able to use their own server
I'm here.
Exactly
Without having to pay you diddly squat.
I give you all the files to generate your own keys
Viperidae, what are you, socialist?
For projects with under $3k profit, it's free
capitalism ftw.
Here's what you do, build your own cloud service.
If you have over $3k of profit, pay a small licensing fee for the key generator and you can host your own keys
You host the server.
They pay.
But under 3k, you are forced to use my own server
$300/month.
That's VERY stupid TheBrokenKeeper
Why is that stupid?
Because NO ONE will bother with that
And they would just avoid using your DRM encryption anyway
Look at UE4, free for projects with under 3k profit
That's the entire engine
Like I said earleir
*earlier
Libre.
When's the last time you looked at how the game industry works?
Pay for commercial usage, free for non commercial usage.
Ex-fucking-actly
You are either ignorant or cannot read english
No, I'm not....
I'm talking about the engine
YOU
The engine is FREE
Everything is free
If you want to make your assets private, it's free for projects under 3k profit
It's that simple
So non commercial is free, very small commercial is free
Are talking about hosting cryptographic keys on some server and having them pay for it, which NO ONE will do
You want to know what a developer who wants private assets will do?
They use your engine, and use the none private assets.
Then write their own wrapper
You don't pay for keys
That uses their own form of DRM
I said to host keys
You pay a fee to license a game under my engine
And in return you get all you need to generate your own keys
The whole server
You just said the engine is free...
Yes
as in beer.
For projects under 3k
You're very confusing and not making any sense
Also
That is not free
The engine is free for non commercial projects, and open source too
But if you want to get more than 3k from it, you need to pay a fee
And you are not forced to use my own way of encoding files
How much?
Not much
Either 5% of the annual profit or something else
Your soul?
^
Maybe
Hmm.
Nice.
I'll keep in contact with you.
That's exactly what I've been saying, but when I say that you tell me that it is free and say you plan on making money by hosting cryptographic keys on some server that people who plan on making more than 3K profit who want private assets.
Wait.
I'm a businessman, I don't have a soul, silly me.
Then entire time TheBrokenKeeper you've been making it look like the engine is libre, and the only thing that costs money is hosting cryptographic keys for private assets
The only thing that costs money is making money with it
http://puu.sh/insQP/b6cb9b3b78.png
Well, you better find a lawyer then!
Isn't this scanner sexy
Very simple
Yeah
It's just the basic structure
CDN/SSL - $400/month
Dedicated Servers - $200/month.
Domain name/SSL - $30/year
Security auditing - $1000/audit
It's pretty cheap
TheBrokenKeeper: I think we've been misunderstanding each other, because I've been under the impression based on what you said that you will only charge for hosting these keys for people who want private assets
No
Because when I said that you should just charge for commercial use, you said
3:25 <TheBrokenKeeper> I don't care about the way the person distributes it
13:25 <Ichiru> My way of P/Invoke is pretty cool
13:25 <TheBrokenKeeper> Viperidae, the whole fucking engine is free
If you want to make your own non-commercial game with private assets, just register your game on my server and you can receive free keys
Viperidae, leave Ichiru out of this.
He's just a boy.
^
i'm too busy writing gl bindings
When you say free, I mean actually free; not free as in beer.
No one was talking to you /s
But if you want your keys to be private and everything private, just get over 3k profit, pay me the fee and you are fully private. I give you all the tools you need to place on your own server and generate keys
So you and I both have a different definition of what free means
Hence the misunderstanding
You sometimes are too focused on your idea that you don't understand what the person is trying to tell you
Also Splitty, just curious I've noticed you use alot of static code in your projects?
And it happens very often with things like this
I would usually implement scanner as an object, as I think a scanner should have state (Position, input source code, token list, ect)
^
Well, TheBrokenKeeper I said basically what you said (That you should charge for commercial use) and you seemed to be correcting me stating that the engine is free, so it would be fair for me to assume you plan on making money elsehow
Well, currently the engine is very free and open source for everyone
Viperidae, use the "What would Stallman do" card.
I pull that on TheBrokenKeeper alot actually
Stallmann would scream at me for using a non-free OS
^^^
https://stallman.org/rants/chronosengine.html
^^^^^^^
but he probably wouldn't be using IRC
Ichiru and your non-free hardware.
since he gets his html pages
by sending an e-mail to a server?
Via email
Yeah
He uses links to view it.
his life sounds so inefficient
He uses public computers of web searches and stuff.
That's because the technology world has changed.
Stallman is a man of principle
We're losing out privacy, one website at a time.
Very admirable.
We're losing our freedom, one software at a time.
He just has to balls to not live with convenience.
no function should have 9 arguments
Right now the only proprietary software I use directly is jetbrains, then there is some proprietary MPEG decoders and Chrome's flash player; but that's about it
what editor?
oh
lol
CLions
CLion*
Why did I just say Jetbrains xD
I use the proprietary PyCharms because of it's amazing Django support.
Linux proprietary stuff: Games, nvidia, skype, flash
Mac proprietary stuff: pretty much everything
Even Xamarin counts
I just use CLion because it does a good job of keeping my source separate from any project files, and works wonderfully with CMake
Jetbrains make the best IDEs.
Have you used the local history thing?
Indeed
I need to make an xbuild config
Yeah, occasionally (It saved me a few times) but I also have a git repo too
That uses my weird corefx compilation system
It helped me a lot when I was writing that OS
Luckily my Macbook uses an Intel GPU, Ichiru so with Linux I can use the open source driver. However, the Wi-Fi card is proprietary (hence Fedora does not ship with it)
I had to install broadcom-wl
Likewise.
I don't use CLion for OSDevelopment
I use Geany for OSDevelopment
kmod-wl to be exact.
I grabbed a usb-ethernet adapter from a wii x)
bacon: Get yourself Pharlap
I'm fine.
If I could figure out how to do OSDev with cmake, then I'd use CLion
I uninstalled linux on this mac though
because I don't have enough space
Viperidae: I was just running make from CLion's terminal emulator
Windows support on Macbook surprised me.
Wait, no
They have a whole project dedicated to it
The only issue is Wi-Fi sometimes fails and refuses to connect.
I actually changed what happens when you press the build button
Yeah, but since you're not using CMake then CLion wouldn't use your code for autosuggest, ect
Tried older drivers.
True
I've been satisfied with Geany, it never gets in the way of anything

I need to use "echo 2 > /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/fnmode" to make it sane when coding.
Therefore, I can use my beloved F-n keys.
I've gotten used to using Command+stuff
It's nice doing Copy+Paste in terminal
And then going to Control+C to quit
I haven't, I have gotten used to the placement of the keys though.
I still hate not having an X11 style compose key

XNU is an ugly bastardization of FreeBSD
At least it's unix-like.

It's bastardization but it's unix.
Running El Capitan developer beta 1
It'd be cool if Windows 10 dropped the NT code base in favor of a *NIX code base. Too bad Microsoft would never do that :(
It's faster than Yosemite
I know, I know.
Really, Ichiru... Hmm.
i got the beta off a torrent :P
I might try that
But, we might get an open source Win10
If only, Viperidae.
Also, it's really funny comparing Unix System V to MS-DOS
Viperidae: That code would be horrendous
s/cortana/bacon
MS-DOS was just a shell for BIOS
MS-DOS is a glorified bootloader
Everything is a glorified bootloader.
^
Fucking matches.
Linux is  a -really- complex boot loader
It's only a couple million lines, Ichiru.
Hardly complex.
Windows has so many compatibility hacks
You have to include manifests with your program
You know what else have manifests, Ichiru?
Planes.
For later windows versions to actually report their version correctly
I can't stand native Win32 development
Otherwise Windows 8 is the maximum version ever
Viperidae, I cannot stand p/invoking and Windows.
It's ugly.

On Linux, you barely ever have to do anything specific to Linux. You're working with the core C standard library, and some POSIX libraries
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724451(v=vs.85).aspx
just wtf is this
On Windows, you can't do anything fancy for long without having to do an #include <win32.h>
You should see my wrapper around the console functionality in Windows, it was just ugly.
Windows you can't do anything
without an #include <windows.h>
That ^

that's always fun
You can make a kernel level level driver though with like no sweat

TheBrokenKeeper, if you need mental help, I would recommend you become insane.
I only get shitty russians
Well, you might as well turn to drugs xDDDD That's bad that you are trying to get yourself away from thinking though, you might benefit from a psychologist.

Viperidae, my position currently doesn't allow me to go to a psychologist
I'm sure something could be worked out...
Because, you know, I have a small cast, can't get out of anywhere
Nor do I need any of my parents to know my problems
Keeping these to yourself is probably harming you more than yourself
^
I have people to talk with
Are they psychologists?
One person is the thing keeping me from not going in a depression
Viperidae, I think he has ADHD, can you write him up a script for some drugs.
But you're already in a bad state to begin with. Seeking professional help can be hard, but sometimes we have problems that are beyond our control and our friends control. I'd probably benefit from some help right now, as I'm becoming increasingly more anti-social.
brb, I got a lunch meeting with the ADHD drug company.

then I wake up in weird positions
I have a script for you.

Take it, buy the $99.99 drugs.
HAHA
Does this smell like flunitrazepam to you?

I'm making pizza and it only takes 14 minutes to cook but these are the longest 14 minutes of my life I AM SO HUNGRY
Ok daddy
<3
Cameron, McCains?
McCains? I thought they just did chips
oh no.
They do pizza here.
Like.
HTPCs are expensive >.>
I had one not 3 hours ago.
This is, in fact
A Tesco pizza.
Tesco.
Tesco.
I am SO sorry
Supermarket.
?
Yep
I don't mind Coles pizzas (supermarket)
However, McCains makes the best pizzas.
I once knew a boy called Dan Coles
Likewise with Dan Tesco.
He was ginger and reminded me of Simon Pegg so I called him Simon
Wow.
Amazing.
He called me alien. Because I'm from outer space
He was in a film filmed in my city I think.

Sharknado?
No.
Damn.
I saw a trailer for it, and the license plates were... Western Australia.

They were just trying to throw you off and it was, as a matter of fact, filmed in Antarctica
Haha.

Southern Antarctica though, y'know, where it's sunny and hot and stuff
I wish I knew he was here during the filming, I would have stalk & raped him.
Weird Al didn't escape.
I made him 'weird' Al.
Can't believe I just read an article about Dan Coles in Perth
Haha.
$487
It was 'Weird' Al Qaeda when I was done with him
for a pentium computer w/ a blu-ray drive
Allahu Akbar and all that shit
Thanks Cameron, that's pretty funny.
Ichiru, I have $487 for you, but it'll cost you.
Did Cameron blow up?
DINNER'S UP.
It'll cost him 487 rashers of the finest bacon
I.E. your extended family
Finest, so Tesco
actually
OUCH
$487, is a reasonable deal
Tesco Finest is in fact a thing yes
wow.
compared to harvey norman prebuilts
Bacon, what would you call all the parts of a for statement?

Fuck.
I was thinking that, but then
I cannot recall what I call it.
Want me to get my language?
I realized, that most languages just make for statements like
brb better go get mah pizza
What I call it for my language*
Read this while I'm gone http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-33107832
for "(" <Statement> ";" <Expression> ";" <Statement> ")" <Statement> I think
I would do a Chinese translation for Descant
But I don't know any internet-related vocabulary besides e-mail
Fair enough
Any translation is helpful though
I could do a shitty one with a dictionary
Good enough for me :P
Bacon, wikipedia calls the last part the afterthought
just gotta make sure your font supports CJK :P
That's it.
where are the translations stored?
I don't recall what I used.
Ah
https://github.com/Aurora0000/descant/tree/v0.2-devel/static/descant/translations
private Expression iterate;
Ichiru
That's what I called it.
I spent a couple hours thinking of a good name.
xD ^
iterate was a good enough name for me.
I stole it from some place.
Like, the future.
now to figure out
how to name the file
I'm guessing I'd name it zh-cn
did i fork the wrong version
i did
Forking hell.
how do i change branch
git checkout v0.2-devel?
You cannot!
You can but you have to pay
i've cloned the whole repo though
git checkout v0.2-devel, yes
Just name the translation lang-zh.json
Aurora01: Chinese has two written forms
Oh, that's true
HEY GUYS LET'S HAVE SOME PIZZA http://imgur.com/a/shKWS
call it lang-zh_CN.json
"POSTED": "posted"
nope
The expression in the image
Aurora Chinese grammar will go
seconds_ago posted
not posted seconds_ago
Well, that's a small issue.
Would it make sense if you didn't include 'posted' at all?
Or is it necessary after the time
Cameron: 1) looking good
2) I will share my pizza pictures when it's past through my digestive tract.
hm
I don't have to include posted I guess
1) Thanks and (2) Sounds hot bby <3
bae, bae... why u ignoring me.
sorry
bae, bae... y u ignoring me.
bae, bae... y u ignorin me.
Yeah, just omit POSTED then, that'd be easier
Otherwise I've got to figure out a way to allow a suffix as well as a prefix
I feel like there's 100 different conversations going on.
That's because there is.
That was easily resolved.
Now, I need more food.
There you go
what context is
"a_week_from_now"
Ichiru, do you watch The Checkout?
used in
But what if pizza is actually green
It's a week ago.
oh.
from now.
no i don't
like a_week_from_now be used as in
"in a week from now, this will happen?"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMYXKSy2fb8 it's an awesome show.
They aren't used currently Ichiru.
You can just skip them
There's too much crust on this pizza ffs
It's just the library I use provides those, and I have to provide a default translation for English
Cameron, I bought a McCains thin crust.
This is stuffed crust and my step-dad bought it ;-;
This is why my mother's single.
and plus, why I buy all my food
You seem like you know your pizza.
Want to work for me?
You'll fetch pizza for me.
I know my pizza but I had to stay at home and look after my little sister who refused to go with my step-dad
So I got no choice in the matter :'c
Sure I'll fetch pizza for you bacon <3
I make an ace bacon sandwich too
Aurora01: also last edited
I know you do.
I have a younger sibling, but he's a twin... so younger by a minute.
Ichiru, just skip that
Chinese people will have to manage without it
:P
^ corruption
Trust you to come out first
I'd have thought you'd be too lazy to leave the womb ;)
Cameron, me too.
But my twin was hidden.
Like.
I was eating him at the time
"bacon, get out" "naw man it's cozy in here I cba"
Haha
It's warm.

Alright, so Aurora and bacon, is it bad that this code allocates 74 objects during the course of its execution?
func main() {
for(i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
print "i is now " + i;
}
36 45 54 63 72 81 90
sorry
wtf
I couldn't give up a challenge.
I meant just
func main() {
for(i = 0; i < 10; i = i + 1) {
print "i is now " + i;
}
}

Thanks for that.
How come a constant isn't tracked by python's garbage collector?
I mean
LOAD_CONST 2
Something like that, which would be int(2)
Enjoyed that video I did sir
Can someone please explain how gc.is_tracked(int(2)) is false?
There is no such thing as primitives in Python
Aurora01: I made the translation
It's saved as lang-zh_CN.json
how do I add it into descant?
So I don't understand how this integer object can be somewhere other than the heap (The local on the stack is just a reference to an integer object, right? python doesn't do boxing)
Ichiru: What language is that?
communist
TheBrokenKeeper: Simplified Chinese
And you fork it, get it on your fork and then you simply do a pull request
Can I please see it?
as in:
how do i integrate it into the program
You don't do anything
It'll automatically detect it
Well, if your browser is set to zh_CN, it'll automatically request that translation
Soo... you know chinese well enough to translate things? I'm amazed
eh
i know enough grammar that I can tell when google translate is wrong
and fix it
Ah, okay
Aurora01: I'm gonna update the .gitignore
to ignore DS_Store
Alright.
i double-committed
Ok, how the fuck is gc.is_tracked("hi" + "lol") false?
but oh well
That's just an immediate value, not getting stored anywhere
"hi" + "lol" is the concatenation of "hi" + "lol"
As a parser would be able to combine those two without asking Python for help
I submitted a pull request
True
I submitted it to master
fuck
No TheBrokenKeeper, that's not it
foo = "Hi"
bar = "Lol"
gc.is_tracked(foo + bar)
False.
ok wtf
I want to merge commits from me v0.2-devel
Well, it would look at the value of foo, and then bar, and simply the parser would concatenate those?
to aurora v0.2-devel

I'm amazed by this guy
Viperidae: because it had a weird evolution
I mean
Why isn't a string like that tracked by the garbage collector
Viperidae: It might be interned?
Like in some sort of string cache?
Possibly, but string is an object?
LOOK AT THE FUCKING VIDEO PEOPLE!
Ichiru, what's the Chinese name for Chinese?
And Python doesn't have primitives.
Yay my tokenizer works

Viperidae, I didn't get any of that
Is https://translate.google.com/#en/zh-CN/Simplified%20Chinese accurate?
Wait
I did
Aurora01: no
That says simplified China
as in china is being simplified
I just pasted that to prove that there are not some compile time optimizations pre-concatenating the string.
Thanks, Google Translate

I know
the phonetic version is: jian ti zhong wen
Pastebin it

I can convert the phonetic stuff with google translate

On Windows it doesn't
If you have the right fonts installed
oh
But on Linux it does
On windows... try Arial Unicode MS
Don't fucking insult me man...
I need a good font...
http://puu.sh/inBer/0e0b0d36f3.png
yay it works
Lucida Sans Unicode
Droid Fuckman?
Open Sans or Source Sans Pro are both good and open source afaik
or Droid Sans Fallback
cowsprivacy
Source Sans Pro is awesome
oh
priacy
piracy
I misread that.
I used the examples. lol
slammi
You've also got Roboto
Bacon Sans.
Viperidae: yoooo fam
fam?
fam
as in family?
sup castiel
as in fam
ah
yo bro wanna chill tomorrow
make sense now.
i need to figure out
how to compile NLua on coreclr :P
Is he your actual brother?
no
Bacon as in "my fam wuz mad deep up in the club the other day"
(Urban Dictionary)
He said fam & bro
sloan
chill or nah
sk8 or die
sk8 bro
sk7
I'd say sure, but my parents will most likely say no
We have relatives coming
At an unknown time
thats dumb
So my parents are like "We need to get the house cleaned up!"
time to strip the NLua repo to bare essentials
k fam
Viperidae, you're just not repel enough
"k fam"
rebel

I'm going to be free on the weekday, but not tomorrow xD
HE WAS A SKATER BOY HE SAID SEE YOU LATER BOY
Sorry I had to
monday fam?
Cameron +1
Like.
Seriously, Cameron +1
Viperidae: Monday is thou chill day
Yeah, I'll be free on monday (Except I have an exam, first half of the day)
OH YA
lemme pick you up
what time does that end
I need to look that up xD
Its the same for all schools
I'll be on my phone
ok text me the details
Alright, I'll just look in my planner
mmmm k fam
ok bye guys
English
Could he not have used something other than IRC for that?
Cameron, this is called progress.

#chillday channel.
bacon fam, u want 2 join us on monday?
k
sk8ing bro?
HE WAS A SKATER-- I'll stop
*Skeeting
He isn't even a skater though
But he has a sexy car.
Cameron, don't stop.
And I want it
<3
Brb I need to go and smother myself in juices
(getting a drink)
You might get rapped in #chillday.

So, I have decided Iodine will use a combination of mark and sweep, and reference counting
Objects that are not tracked, will use reference counting
That's not bad.
However,
I recommend you use the hit and run method.
xD
"The object in the heap will have a one night stand activated, knowing as 'hitting', upon successful 'hitting', it will 'run'.
"
or the more ethic one.
"The object will notice that there's some of your former gang members in your area, they disrespectful yo' ass, there's no way they'll be leaving. You hit them with your car, and drive off, while they're in a deactivated state".
Viperidae, I am building an Arduino sex toy.
+1
The toy will come in sizes.
Write in AVR assembly
then send me the code
Haha, haha.
The sizes are in relation to the boarss.
boards.
Micro.
Nano.
Uno.
Duo (or whatever)
...
You get the idea.
Then the Lilypad for your first one.
So you guys know that Jacob will be gone 3 weeks?
I've been given the responsibility of supervising tel
Good idea
Gone for 3 weeks?
Yeah, he is going to Jesus camp
Viperidae, could you help me find where the fuck HTC stores it's theme fonts?
Phone web browsing sucks
oh jeez I have no idea
Non-voluntary Religious Re-education Center, Viperidae
Gameguy could help you
But he isn't here
Google?
Osystem/fonts
*system/fonts
According to http://www.droidviews.com/how-to-install-custom-fonts-on-android-devices/
HTC, not Android
These are special HTC Sense 7 only fonts
I made a mistake browsing the internet without protection.
I was looking at arduino boards on a site (dx.com) and...
now Google is displaying ads for Arduino boards at dx.com on YouTube.

Uhm
Android is an operating system?
You /should not/ need third party tools for this.
HTC is a company?
Is HTC an operating system also?
I thought HTC used Android
It does
But HTC Sense took over the whole Android interface with it's own theme system
Then look in /system/fonts?
They are different
I found Font.apk in the themes folders
Well I can't find anything specific to HTC Sense
You should know better, bacon
I need to decode one of them Font.apk file
ALWAYS wear a condom while browsing the internet
ThePhoneKeeper just unzip iz xD
Speaking of fonts
it*
I had a dream where my mom (She's blind) wanted me to read her something on her computer
But it was in a weird font
You sure Splitty?
yes
Viperidae your dreams are weird
So I started reading her equations to belzier curves for the true type font.
Vould you test that for me?
lol
ThePhoneKeeper: APKs are zips
I'm on a fucking phone
and?
^
I can't easily extract things
I can unzip zip files on my phone :/
Search for unzip on the play store..
Viperidae, linear interpolation is a turn on for me.
Ooooohhh *wink*
100% quadratic
bleh
CoreFX is broken still
i'll wait for a proper release before I use it to compile
Viperodae, no luck in the system/fonts folder
Unzip that fonts.apk
I must go now.
Goodbye, everyone.
Splitty_ first app didn't help
**kwargs - I have no idea what this does in python.
Ah
nvm.
bacon its for defining functions with an arbitrary number of args
I know.
I just read that.
k
splitty_, could you please give me a link to a good app?
It was weird at first for me.
TPK they are all bad. xD
But they should all work
I need one that extracts apk
Rename it to .zip
The fist one simply opens it
iOS - extract ipa:
ssh in
cd wherever
unzip ..ipa

Yeah, ThePhoneKeeper it might be easier to do it from the command lined

Don't have one
How to install OpenSSH in iOS.
Jailbreak.
Open Cydia

Bash will already be installed.
Well fuck you too
ssh root@ip
Bash isn't already installed

Android uses ash I think
For iOS.
Oh
That's nice
I haven't done that shit on my Android yet.
To unlock it, I need to sign up for an Motorola account and unlock it
void my warranty but meh
I will do this and install a custom mod later on
note: do not run an ssh server on port 22 unless you want to be brute-forced
didn't get hacked but omg the amount of times people tried to login with "root:password"
Ichiru, there's is an active debate about whether to run an ssh server on port 22 or not. It's security through obscurity, some consider using fail2ban or whatever as a better method.
It's an inconvenience for me.
eh
SSH -P 1337 ...
running it on another port removes the spam
SCP*
Make sure it's not over 1024
why
Viperidae, what to do from the command line?
Because, it'll not be running on a privileged port.

I still want my warranty. I had to order my phone from Romania. In the US there is already a bootloader unlocked version
SAMPLE.
And splitty. I really want my warranty on a 1k USD phone
That's how much it is in Romania
My phone is only $270 ($170 in US), so not really much loss
(fucking good phone for the price)
Is it octa core with 3 GB of RAM?
No, because I would never need that much power for my phone.
Well, it's not a phone
Brb
"ThePhoneKeeper"
Yes?
What's not a phone
Yours
How?

I can't stand people who waste money on over powered phones
Viperidae, it's uber powerful
I can use it to write an OS on it. Play games, do anything
You can do everything... except
I can do that one mine

Shots fired.
Can you play GTA V?
I'm pretty sure it's not ported to mobile devices.
has it been?
Nope
Then no one can.
But there's GTA San Andreeas
I'll be back on my PC
I can play that (and has passed it on) and the others, on my two year old iPod Touch 5G.
I mean laptop
The thing is
512mb RAM, crappy AMD CPU
AMD?
Who the hell would play a game on a phone
When

You could just get a computer
I don't play games on my computer.
I don't play games xD And when I do, I play games for the story. I find competitive multiplayer to be waste of time.
The GTA SA story was very interesting.
^
GTA SA is an awesome game
I like the one quote by CJ.
Um.
Fuck.
Anyone knows a better font than Lucida Sans Unicode?
I think I screenshotted it.
Can you be more specific?
xD
I didn't.
However, it was from the mission "Key to Her Heart", where you follow a girl's car who works at the casino and ultimately becomes her gimp.

Fucking bacon
nomnomnom
in my ass
I found one freaky font
splitty_: This one's for you
Cameron, you're drunk.
<3
Always
splitty_: http://puu.sh/inFUx/53f27274da.png
Ew
Who's that Cameron guy in your screenshot? He seems like a right laugh
I have no idea. Some old creep trying to creep back in
Jeez, this font. It's so fucking weird that I'll keep it
Cameron, please don't be British.
Even though it will require me to get used to it. It's too different
bacon: How much do you dislike that font?
and with a passion
#bringbackcomicsans
Meh
I'll keep it around :D
It looks good with my quotation though.
Indeed it does
I'm sorreh mah friend, wuuuud you lahk sum moonshaan?
lol TheBrokenKeeper that font
It's sorta cool in it's own way
But also weird
And hard to read with it
^^
For example, what Cameron said about moonshine was kinda hard to read
Yay, the day changed :D
It's june 14th
Fuck you in the future
It's still the 13th here
In 10 days, I'll give everyone Pizza OS. It will contain a malware like Anthrax that will override your MBR
And it will be in the form of a PPTOS
Aviv said he'll be helping me
Wait where the hell are you if you're 2 hours ahead?
Romania
I have a Romanian friend
Cool
I hate all Romanian people. With a fucking passion.
It's 5:01 14th of June for me.
Except for one person
There's one person that I don't hate
Is it my friend?
You?
But everyone else can go take one up their ass
And not me
:(
Aviv, how's Pizza OS going?
Uhm
Also, did you see the font?
I hate everyone especially Cameron.
You love me, bacon
If you teach me how to PPTOS, I got PowerPoint 2016 :D
I love the affair.
I am your trusty cooker
Your pizza bitch
Yup, I love that... but I do not love you as a person.
Because I am not of a person.
I am bacon.
+1
Bacon do not love.
Bacon is only loved
Haha +1 deep
I provide the mayonaise amongst your lettuce and tomato
Haha
im14andthisisdeep
imCameronandthisiscribs
I'm so MTV
TheBrokenKeeper: the preview version?
Yes
well
I was not aware that was available yet
lol
Also, I'm Broken. Nice meeting you all, now, you can all go and die :D
<3
So Romanian
I'm just kidding, I love you all
<3
Well, not really, but I don't hate any of you
You fucking love me you want my dick in your arse
Sorry I'm very forward tonight
/kill Cameron Sorry, I almost forgot the space
Cameron, as your wingman, FUCKING STOP BEING YOURSELF.
I haven't had sex since September so I'm out to bum every bitch in dis place
"Bitch" being bacon, repeatedly
oh this is nice: the office year finally aligns with the version number
Hahaha, Cameron
Not if their version numbering for the next Office follows that of Windows
It'll be Office 16.0
66.6
Office is released on a 3 year cycle
Wow Office has really irregular periods
So Office 2019 will be office 17
it's office 15
It should consider going on the pill
Office 2013 is 15
and office 2010 is 14
oh yeah mac didn't get 2013
and office 2007 is 12
they skipped 13
Preview of 2016 is 15 for me :P
lol
That's... not possible
I used System.Reflection.Emit to add error handling to my OpenGL wrapper :D
Wow...
//bat.bing.com/bat.js
TheBrokenKeeper: It's only 71 lines :P
:P
Nice
for the error handling that is
The wrapper is more than 71 lines
IKR
Ni ce
Is that 11 or 71? This font makes it very weird
seventy-one
So the second one then
http://pastie.org/private/3pp1qztonwjgophrf0aacg
if checkErrors is enabled, it injects CheckErrors() into each gl call
CheckError() *
Why not just juice OpenTK?
too big
You sure?
yes
i'm using a small subset of OpenGL with SDL2
Okay
reducing the tons of layers of abstraction means less bugs :P
I don't need 2 backends per platform to debug
yes you do
I think I might tear out MonoGame's png reader
nope
If you do that then you might have a segmentation fault
something like that
G'night ladies xo
Night too.
Alright so Iridium is now just using reference counting
Nice
splitty_ How easy would it be to render a gui
With only rectangles, lines, and text :P
Pretty easy.
Lines and text is all you need :D
Hello old sport
Whats up?
Not much, I'm trying to redo Iodine's garbage collector. Something like
for(i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
print "i is " + i;
}
Allocates like over 70 new objects in memory, which I think is too much
Nullz: Do you compile your Python scripts in your engine?
Hey Nullz!
And Hello
Yeah viper, how is that 70 xD. No I didnt know you can compile them. Sup splitty
Well, it's 70 because it runs like this
i = new Integer(0)
while(i < new Integer(10)) {
print new String("i is ", + i);
i = new Integer(i + 1);
}
Nullz: This is how simple it is: http://pastebin.com/sZPf57UU
Whats so good about it being compiled than just interpreted at run time? And Yeah I get it now because its creating a new string and all that. How much memory is that using though?
Compiled is always faster than interpreted
Not that much, Nullz most interpreted languages are compiled xD Like python
Python runs faster when its interpeted
I mean
the bytecode that is compiled is faster
This is IronPython
Oh, so its CIL then
It compiles down to MSIL
*CIL
Okay...
I think that CIL is faster than interpreting the Python code, isn't it?
Yeah
But CPython still compiles the code
True
Can you still call update functions in the compiled version?
But that doesn't have a JIT compiler
Yes
You can just turn your scope into a dynamic object and do whatever you want
hmmm If you compile it and theres an error in the source, will it throw an exception while compiling or when it's ran?
I have no idea
xD
I never tried
I tend to not make many errors, for some weird reason
Well, I do make logical errors
But not syntax errors and such
No one makes syntax errors
xD
Dude I make so many syntax errors in Python that I've spent hours trying to fix something that ended up just to be the syntax of my python script
lol
Thats why want it to also use C#
C# as a scripting language is a BAD idea
shh
It is
Unity does it >>
C# isn't designed for scripting xD
Unity uses MONO's thing
I dont care >> I like C#
Which still compiles C# and such
Lua is nice for scripting
Why is it a bad idea?
You can say the same about Unreal Engine and how it uses C++ the same way Unity uses C#
Too bloated
TheBrokenKeeper C++ isn't really used as a scripting language in Unreal.
I know
It's really made for huge chunks of performance critical code
It's the same as C# and Unity
I was giving Nullz an example
k
He said that C# is just a scripting language in Unity. It kinda is, but it's not really a scripting language
Okay, but still why is it so bad?
To do anything in C# you need to import things, get a namespace declaration, make a class, do things
It's a statically typed imperative language with very strong typing, requiring all code to be inside classes, and requires alot of code to do the simplest things
But in Python, you can just do things right away
Thats why you make API's :D
Well, IronPython compiled vs interpreted C# scripting... I'd go with the compiled Python for the speed
public class Something : SomeGenericInterfaceOrAbstractClass {
public static void SomeEntrypoint() {
DoStuff();
}
}
vs just
doStuff()
Well I'm including both so I dont see why it matters so much :D
Honestly, I'd implement my own language if I was writing a game engine (Just because that's fun). Bethesda did it, and so did the creators of GTA SA, oh and COD for some shit
But regarding C# as a scripting language
http://www.reddit.com/r/spaceengineers/comments/28j9qn/dear_devs_c_is_not_a_scripting_language_please/
I'll do that later. Currently, I want a quick'n'dirty scripting language
Viperidae: Look how great this is: http://pastebin.com/Cb1ggb6w
Cool, but shouldn't this all be stuff written in C# xD
Nope
Uhm, I'm pretty sure this should
It's already compiled down to C
CIL*
I know, but this is still critical code that really ought to be part of the core engine and not some separate python stuff
var texture = Texture2D.LoadTexture("classical_ruin_tiles_1.png", true);
dynamic texture_sheet = script.TextureSheet(texture, 23, 16);
dynamic map_meta = script.MapMeta(64, 64);
layeredMap = script.LayeredMap(script.map_test, map_meta, texture_sheet);
Anyways I'm gonna start a C course tomorrow :D
This is not critical code that isn't part of the engine
This is code from my game
This won't be in the engine
I liek it.
Oh, see what I'd do is provide some generic file format for maps that all games could use
Like NBT or something
Like we were talking about earlier
I'll do that
But this is scripting
This is the current map renderer for the game I'm working on to showcase the engine
Still, if this is supposed to be a game that runs on your engine I'd do it in C# and avoid using the dynamic keyword too much
I decided to go the route Ichiru said, write a game and shape the engine arround it
I can't
IronPython requires me to use dynamic
yeah ^
(dynamic typing is expensive).
Well, can't you only use dynamic when you are interfacing with python shit?
Well, that's all python shit you see over there with the dynamic keyword
Yeah, I only found you need to use dynamic when calling a def
Or instantiating a class
well grabbing a variable, and apparently defs are variables in ironpython
Well..
Defs are objects
Functions and variables are all held inside a dictionary named __dict__ inside the Python class
I mean
functions are objects
Oh okay.
Viperidae: IronPython is a *dynamic* language runtime
Working on specification on stuff for my engine so I'm not randomly adding a bunch of shit then realizing what i spent a week on is still a piece of shit xD
So I guess by definition it requires the user to use dynamic binding
When interfacing it... I'm just saying things like loading file formats, ect shouldn't be scripts
I'm not loading file formats anywhere
All that will be C#
Me and splitty are working on it currently, neither one of us have any idea on how to do it
But we are brainstorming
Things that should be scripts should be extensions to game objects, stuff added in levels, missions, ect
My gl binding is almost complete
Or a simple map renderer!
(for my purposes)
Ichiru
Should something like rendering a map be a script? Or part of the core game, or engine?
Not the engine definetly
If it's not a game-specific engine
Then script
As it's part of the game and not the engine, if the user doesn't want a map, don't force him to have one. Let him do things however he wants
What/
*?
The user doesn't have a map?
Wait
Are you talking about like a minimap?
Look at XNA, you've used it. It doesn't force you to use it's own map object
Or a level?
or you could completely ignore there being a map and just not use it...
A level
one could do it like unity
a scene filled with objects
And by game engine I mean the game engine that uses your engine
There isn't a game engine that uses my game engine
There is a game engine and a game
A game engine is the library I'm providing
Lol the specific code for the game usually has its own engine shit that the developers make
And the game is whatever the user creates
That's called "The game"
Inside the game you might have something like
I don't think that anything you create under Unity you call a game engine...
lol
Do you?
public interface IMapProvider {
}
ect
I would, I would just call it a super wrapper.
wouldnt8
I mean, I'm sure you have a different definition of game engine than I do
Viperidae, do you call a game you make in Unity, a game engine?
I don't think so
If someone just makes a game in unity, I'd call them a bad developer
A game engine provides you with what you need to create a game
Oh really?
They ought to provide a good abstraction layer, ect
But...
Viperidae: You have game-specific engines, like the Halo engine
I don't even know what it's like to use a generic game engine xD
And then you have general game engines, like Unity
Because the highest level shit I've ever use with game development is like XNA
it's a really weird mix of visual programming and C#
This is a general game engine
But, you can make a game engine in XNA
This is a game engine made on top of OpenTK
I know
And then you make a game on top of that
But not another game engine
As this is not Inception
Oh yes it is!
Cue mind heist!
Personally I'd rather make a bunch of awesome features that dont have to be used for the user instead of forcing the user to make his own features.
But that's taking all the fun away from the user
splitty_: This is for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W95uWopoO0
If thats fun the user then the user should make there own engine.
Viperidae: Could you pelase explain to Nullz why making your own things is fun?
The making your own features is what I call fun, I couldn't see myself using all of an existing engine xD
Also, Nullz. I don't want to write 100 games
Because that would mean that I'd need to write everything for both 2D and 3D
A normal tilemap, isometric, perspecive tilemap
So on and so forth
Then for 3D. Primitive renderer, model renderer, shaders
So on and so forth
Well, no, for 3D it isn't
That's also probably why I had that little thing with TheTimeKeeper about game engines inside game engines, because I naturally would want to do alot of the stuff that a game engine does, by myself even if I was provided with an existing game engine.
That's why my game engine will only provide rendering and such
So you can write your own things with it
By rendering I mean rendering of basic textures and sprites for 2D
Billboards, primitives and models for 3D
I'm writing the game engine for ease of use and fast productivity.
I mean, yeah that's your end goal but the fun is getting there!
ofcourse! But the users shouldn't have to do that.
Have you seen how many people use XNA?
It doesn't even provide a sprite
Or a freaking way of drawing primitives
You do that yourself!
I'm not making this engine mainly for the users but mainly for my self. Selling it to people is just a extra thing
For real now... You can't draw a line or a rectangle in XNA
You do that yourself!
And how do you do that in XNA?
Write a function to do it?
You have no access to the underlying rendering engine
All you can render are textures in XNA
and fonts
Nullz, MonoGame doesn't even have fonts
I had to use Ichiru's font renderer
>> Are you sure..?
Anyways, XNA is just a really abstracted wrapper for DirectX
I tried once to find how to generate a dynamic texture in XNA. Everyone said that you have to create an array of textures the size of a pixel
And I am 100% sure
Sometimes the MGCB compiler goes weird
TheBrokenKeeper: You make an array of pixels the size of a texture!
Ichiru. Please tell Nullz how there's no font support in MonoGame
You can't do that in XNA afaik
hold on I'll ether prove it to my self or you
Nullz, I tried it a few weeks ago
I couldn't load a SpriteFont
In MonoGame, not XNA
I know.
In the past few days MonoGame has had a lot of improvements
Really?
When the next stable release is packaged
Did they add SpriteFonts for Linux?
+ integrated into Xamarin Studio it'd be good
SpriteFonts for Linux has always been there
And did they finally implement that content pipeline tool for Linux too?
Nope
They've just been a bitch to implement
I couldn't load them
not implement
compile correctly *
So like recursive fibonacci sequence is like guaranteed segmentation fault in iodine xd
Great...
Good job mate, you did it!
It causes the stack to grow exponentially
Even better...
Just, fix your language already XD
Don't argue on here
TheBrokenKeeper: There is nothing broken with it :/
You sure?
Yes
The stack just can't handle it, and that isn't broken either
Soo... recursive function == segmentation fault... That's not broken?
recursive function = stack overflow
Get pattern matcing like Haskell's
Eww, no
So you can do:
fact 0 = 1
fact n = n * fact (n - 1)
lolno
Why not?
That has no place in Iodine
function test(0) { return 1; }
function test(n) { return n * test(n - 1); }?
Or....
Tail call!
optimization
Also that's factorial, and I have no problem with recursive factorials in Iodine xD
Did you know that in Haskell if you do: cat = "dog" would just make a parameterless function called cat that returns "dog"?
http://gyazo.com/24d6938cca838d755934a22745c43666 Did it.
Because fib does 	return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
the stack grows exponentially
Nullz: That's not on Linux...
That's on Windows
And it works perfectly on Windows
But not on Linux
You could of said that.
#TangoDown
Man, this font is weird
http://puu.sh/inRsg/b944ee0540.png
I created a linux monogame project and it still has spriteBatch.DrawString();
Aviv, check out this weird but amazing font: http://puu.sh/inRsg/b944ee0540.png
Okay
Did you run it under Linux?
lol
No.
And of course it has the function
But you can't load a SpriteFont
Viperidae: chunk(name, items(header(name, item), header(name, item))) would work for a file format
Fuck, I just noticed, I can't even do TCO on fib
Of couts all of that would be in a binary format
Fuck
Zero is a big number
1/0 is a big number
*explodes*
throw new DividebyZeroException();
int 0x00
1/0 is actually 0 for an infinite number of times :P
TheBrokenKeeper: Not, so...
It would appear that way
zero is half of infinity.
Numberphile sait it is
That wasn't what numberphile said xD
This is nice: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP9pnSXhibw
I watched that video
Really?
Yeah, the one by numberphile
I watched it a couple of years ago, I forgot

He's showing how to solve division through subtraction, and when you divide a number (Like 20 / 4) you just keep subtracting the divisor until you get 0, but that won't work with 0 because 20 - 0 is 20, and you'll never get to 0
gr8 m8, 8/8
That was for Nullz
The reason division by 0 is not infinity though is because
lim 1/x = -â
x -> 0-
and
lim 1/x=â
x -> 0+
So lim 1/x
x -> 0
is undefined, as there is a gap between the two limits
ew
calculus
I haev no idea what that lim of anything is
have*
Is it limit?
Yes
As x approached 0 from the left, y becomes closer to negative infinity; as x approached 0 from the right, y becomes close to positive infinity. The two don't converge
I need to start doing things properly, start overriding the Equals and GetHashCode thing for things that require it
I love how everything for me is a thing, and multiple ovjects are things XD
I don't really specify what I'm talking about mostly
Viperidae: Is it bad that I use structs in c#?
For what? Sometimes structs are faster
For thigns like a simple node elment in a file
Well
Also, how does one implement a good GetHashCode function?
override*
The problem with that is, you don't reference structs by reference in C#, you reference them by value
If you had
struct Point {
public int X, Y;
public Point(int x, int y) {
X = x;
Y = y;
}
}
and did
bool areEqual = new Point(1, 2) == new Point(1, 2) I'm pretty sure you would get true
If you did that with a class, you'd get false
That's what I want
(Unless you override equals)
Well, if you were using Point
And your only sub values were integers
Now, would I go about overrinding the GetHashCode function for a struct with these fields:
public string NodeName;
public object NodeValue;
public override int GetHashCode() {
return 41 * (NodeName.GetHashCode() + NodeValue.GetHashCode());
}
Note: 41 could be any prime number
But make it a prime number
Or else you'd be likely to have collisions
Okay
I came across this a while on the internet, let me try to find where I found it
I also found this:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/263400/what-is-the-best-algorithm-for-an-overridden-system-object-gethashcode
Here
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2733541/what-is-the-best-way-to-implement-this-composite-gethashcode
Ih
*Oh
lol
we found the same one xD
Yup
There's a nice class someone provided
I'll steal nightcoder's work :D
itch
*Witch
Thank you. That's so sweet for you to say. <3
It's not nice to just copy stuff verbatim
I know :D
how will you learn if you just copy/paste
I already know how to do it
Simply get the hashes, add them, multiply them by a prime and that's about it
then whyd you look up howto?
I didn't know before I looked it up
Viperidae: Is this overkill? http://pastebin.com/w3HbSzGS
Uh, yeah xD
I never use those operators
You never use ==?
This has both Equals and ==
I use == for comparing reference
If you come from Java, Equals would be familiar for you
not equality
I rarely ever use == on objects that aren't primitives in C#
Interesting
Soo... this should be: lengthOfName, name, lengthOfValue, value inside a binary writer, right?
Yeah, if you wrote a string
Or anything for that matter
Even if you wrote a list, it will still have a length
I don't want to store a type, or should I?
I did for my format
Where should I place the format and how should I save it as? A simple byte?
Maybe after the name?
Soo... there's the name, type and value?
Yeah, or an enum
(Which would be cast to a byte)
Yes
But I'm talking about inside the file
Yes, a byte
I did https://github.com/GruntTheDivine/gcl/blob/master/GruntXProductions.CoreLib/Configuration/EnumBcfTag.cs
And you don't need to cast, you can do:
enum InsertEnumNameHere : byte {
Element1 = 0x00 }
Or that
What kind of dark magic is that Microsoft xD
Telling what type the value you assign the enum element is?
It's making enum derive System.Byte, I just find that kind of awkward. Yes, enums can be objects but its weird to see that happen at runtime (And the fact than enum is deriving a struct)
woo
got some basic primitives
Can we see?
Okay, now, I also store a node type
And I should really sleep
It's 3:42 AM
Soo... yeah
Brb, going on Linux and then I'll sleep
lol
There is a party going on in my house
I went downstairs to see what's going on. Now I'm drunk. gg

Ah ok, I thought it was some ungodly thing
Yo TheBrokenKeeper I'm sorry that I didn't reply to your pm
I was downstairs, there is some kind of a party going on xD
srsly though
Theres ants in my room :/

Nullz I can't even connect to Sykpe
My DNS doesn't seem to work
Viperidae did you ever have this problem before?
I can't access any website
And I can't connect to Skype
Weird
Try ipconfig /flushdns
The Steam chat + IRC work fine
I did this multiple times today
It fixed it for like 5 minutes
Hmm.
What are your default DNS servers?
I even tried to change my DNS from the Fritz!Box ones to Googles
(Do ipconfig /all )
Before my primary DNS server was 192.168.178.1 (my router)
Now it's 8.8.8.8
8.8.8.8? Hmm..
Okay connected to skype. Took a really long time
8.8.8.8 is Google's DNS
Ah ok
This is really weird
Google chrome decided like
ay
I'm not gonna render
xD
Fuck you!
Nullz_: This is why we use clients xD
xD
Splitty_: Are you using DHCP to obtain your DNS servers?
is it still broken
:/
Nope Viperidae
I need to hardcode my DNS servers
Ah, ok.
ALso
My mother has that annoying Fritz!Box security thing
To control the internet time of my sister
I have unlimited internet time but I can't change my IP
What in the name of god is a Fritz!Box? It sounds like some ungodly contraption straight from the depths of hell
It's a popular router manufacturer here
Oh, ok
lol
It's fucking awful
They used to be really good
But now they just suck
I need my own router..
Have your mom get a managed switch, then setup a separate vlan for your sister xD
XamarinStudio's native Cocoa port
Is terrible
I can't open two solutions!
THIS IS AN OUTRAGE
though really the annoying thing is the constant crashing
I really shouldn't be mixing text layout
With rendering glyphs
but oh well
I'm gonna go to sleep
Goodnight
debugging opengl is not fun
my previous renderer worked
but it used lots of ugly hacks
This one still uses a font substitution hack to support all of unicode
But no layout hacks :D
next step: audio!
I've already written a library for this :D
oh dear, I can't debug it in Xamarin Studio on mac :|
i'll have to develop audio on Linux
Good.
I am proud, Ichiru
Just watched The Imitation game
Holy shit that was a good movie
yay
hm
I got streaming audio working
Next stop: sfx

I've added more hacks
mostly to trash a thread without OSX's OpenAL complaining

Update: added a second hack because sometimes Stopwatch likes to give negative times

I need to create a simple vector-graphics format
everything can be defined in rectangles, lines, and triangles
+ i don't want pixeled gui art
Hello earthlings.
& Ichiru.
hi
Hello.
I want to make a small vector graphics editor
but i only know how to use System.Drawing :/
Same.
Haha.
I made a vector editor awhile back but it's shit
i just need filled rectangles
triangles
and lines
You could control the control points of the shapes, but it was distorted for some unknown reason.
The primary use of it was to make flow charts
GDI has a surprisingly powerful drawing library
http://pastebin.com/FKms5Xab <- I wrote that 12 months ago. Still working on the same general project. Wow. (Warning visual basic.. gross)
I'm going to splurge for the official arduino board tomorrow hopefully.
The kits are too expensive.
$200.
Why Arduino when you can have an rPi v2 with $30 USD?
It has all the shield-like things you need
40 GPIO pins
Because a rPi doesn't meet my needs.
It's not a micro-controller.
(plus much more expensive here0
)*
It's more expensive here too, about 100 USD
I want the board to do one thing, run my code.
But it has a quad core 900 MHz chip with 1 GB of RAM
It's still a computer.
I only own an Arudino Uno, it's storage space was way too small
If I need storage, I can get a SD module.
Can you run code from the SD card?
No, it's a microcontroller.
Then you don't have enough storage space
I won't be running uLinux or anything like that.
I think my Uno has 32 MB for both the firmware and my code
I want to learn it so I can get into microcontrollers, which are constraint to these limitations.
constrained
Okay...
How the heck would one make an encryption method that works with generated one-time use only?
one time use key*
Make it time-based.
How would one do that?
Tell me the setup.
I have no setup
I'm working with splitty on some sort of a file storage method for my game
And I want encrypted files with one-time use keys
Ah, this will require a central server, so no.
Which will be generated by a central server
Ah.
Will the central server send the encrypted parts of the file?
Nope
Then you're fucked.
They will be stored on the user's computer
All files will be encrypted
I need an algorithm that modifies itself each time you use a key
Maybe the old key determines the way the file modifies so the next key works?
So each use will have it's own generation of keys?
It's impossible because it'll be vulnerable to reverse engineering.
Well, if someone starts reverse engineering it, that one person can do it
Then, if you don't care... generate the key based on the time. If the time does not fit within the time limit, deny it.
Like.
two-factor authentication.
My bank token generator has a unique code.
It generates the token based on the time and the unique code.
The bank has the same unique code.
But that code would require to work for the duration of the person playing the game
HOTP
or
TOTP
I don't recall.
How would I make the code work for as long as the user plays the game?
If the user plays the game for 8 hours straight, the code needs to work
Um, load the files into RAM.
As I don't think you can load in RAM 30-40 GB of data
Ah.
You're fucked.
Honestly...
There's a way.
Homomorphic encryption
However, it's not yet suitable for mass adoption.
Then... decryption will be based on the serial key and logging into a server
Not if the cryptosystem is designed properly.
Then how the heck should I go about it?
r = ef(p, k)
r^2 = f
e(k, p) = sum(f-1)
You are either crazy or you think I know how to transpose that into code
oh no, they are nonsense.
I honestly don't know.
XD
bacon cipher?
/s
^
TheBrokenKeeper.
I don't know how it works fully...
but if I recall correctly you can use a random key for swap... so when the random key no longer exists in memory, you cannot recover it.
(with dm-crypt)
wait.
no
wouldn't work
Homophobic encryption.
^
+1
(it won't work because it's merely the encryption key)
I need a haircut
Cameron, my hair is still long.
In my pizza pics yesterday it was like folded in on itself about four times over
You lied to us?
wow.
wow.
wow.
I'm so heart broken right now.
I cannot even even.
</3
I can think of something else of yours which is still long
Brb gonna go make tea like a true Brit, who else wants one?
If you don't like Chai you can go fuck yourself
I'm aussie.
TheBrokenKeeper, I have an idea... you could have dedicated hardware!
/s
Good idea!
Then every indie developer will need to pay 100k to get an USB stick to develop, right?
-> picked Chai because it's tastiest tea
yup
yup
TPM?
-> later discovers that Chai is also in fact the healthiest
Haha
This NEVER happens
You store the key on the TPM.
Chai = best thing ever
and wipe it upon closing of the game
However, stallman is against TPMs.
Ugh rub my moist flaps <3 https://www.teaindia.co.uk/tea-shop/chai-range/vanilla/
Anyway yeah brb
bacon: If I write a string with a BinaryWriter, does that simply write a length - data thing?
Yeah.
I think so.
It's been awhile.
I need to test
How does one make a stream stored in RAM?
MemoryStream
Thanks
How would I go about writing an object to RAM and then reading it back?
Shout me a drink, if you really want to say thanks, mate.
Not knowing the object it is?
What type of object?
Serialization?
object. System.object
My own serialization
"The name's Object. System.Object"
Haha.
I didn't see that.
You could store a "kind" of object?
Wait.
No.
Exactly
Give me an example of the object.
Currently I have: byte, short, int, long, string. Will add: array, list, dictionary, tuple and custom object
Oh why is my router so terrible at DNS
I'm thinking aobut using a BinaryConverter, get it's bytes, write the length of the bytes and then the bytes
You'll need some some of kind byte.
But how would I convert back to the object from byte form?
serialize.
deserialize
That's the problem, C#'s serialization. I'm trying to write my own method
int, easy.
string, easy.
long, easy.
short, easy.
the rest.
hard.
array of any of those
int length
then length items
Found this: http://www.morgantechspace.com/2013/08/convert-object-to-byte-array-and-vice.html
Wairt
I need a drink, brb.
It's using serialization
Fuck
Yeah, I'll hard code shit
Who knew that getting the active page in django would be hard.
bacon: How the fuck can I serialize an object?
Should I just use C#'s for primitive types?
Write to binary?
Sure, I have never used serialization
I have used it once. I hated it.
bacon: Can I do a static implementation of a thing from an interface?
I don't know actually.
I doubt.
Nope
Umn... Let's drop the interface!
Or...
How does one make static things for an interface?
Could you use a BinaryFormatter?
I got mah Chai
numanumanumanum
That's what I'm using
What's the interface for?
couldn't you use a singleton?
Question: I downloaded Adobe CS6
public static Cameron Instance {
Is Adobe Audition useful?
No idea what that is.
I last used CS5.
eh it's another DAW
I have audacity + garageband
more than enough
I can't use a singleton
These are static encode and decode methods for thigns
so in total I'm only installing: Illustrator Photoshop, Premier Pro, and After Effects
totally worth the download of the whole suite
Audition is good
Not so much as a DAW though it's better for recording, bit like Audacity
Or mastering
i might as well just use garageband tbh
For a DAW I'd recommend Reaper
i already have that installed
Reaper is brilliant and has a pretty nice interface
Very cheap for a DAW as well
If only Adobe had a Community Edition like Visual Studio does
Use BaconRAW.
The RAW DAW.
It can DRAW too.
ProTools, SONAR and Cubase are good if you're willing to splash out a bit more and learn them
adobe illustrator is nice
Inkscape is good too
Even FL Studio is seriously underrated as a DAW, its strong association with EDM means people tend not to take it seriously but it's very powerful and intuitive
But it's a bit in the way
If you've got a Mac, get Serif's Affinity Designer
I stg I would buy a Mac just for that piece of software
i will never understand why proprietary software takes up so much disk space
bacon: WORKS!
All their failed attempts at DRM haha
I can serialize byte, short, int, long and string!
But I can only serialize one node at a time...
Now, I need to stick multiple next to eachother
But now, gaming time!
It looks like drawing svg is going to require a lot of maths
yup
I'll probably end up making some sort of SVG->Internal Representation Compiler
YO AURORA
Hello, Cameron.
upon examination of a simple svg file
It may be rather easy to render it
assuming a polygon will always have 3 points :P
Ichiru: What about curves?
And gradients?
And paths?
you have to start somewhere
and my somewhere is single colour rects, lines, and triangles
Okay
Illustrator generates weird svg files
I only have rectangles
ah nvm
I was saving wrong
Ichiru: Where does one find the format of an SVG file?
http://www.w3.org/TR/SVGTiny12/
This is the Spec for SVG Tiny 1.2
tbh I'm just making files in illustrator
and exporting them to SVG Tiny
Ichiru: http://puu.sh/ior7q/2ac77c0284.png

splitty_: nice!
I can restore the input 1:1. This is the first time I'm actually building a tree structure from the tokens.
TheBrokenKeeper, want to test Descant's theme switching system?
Sure
http://django-descant.rhcloud.com/static/descant/#/
Go to the user control panel
Then you can guess from there
Works
I don't understand how people work on projects for more than a week
To be fair, Descant is more like 2 separate projects
One in HTML/CSS/JS, one in Python
i need to read xml in manually :(
no serialization
splitty_: I'm half way there with the file format
Now, I need an encoding algorithm
That will morph the file after each use of a key so the previous key doesn't work
It uses the previous key as the seed on how to morph the file for the next key
Soo... are you up to the task?
hm
for paths if I get a triangulator it shouldn't be too hard
it's the gradients that are hard
Gradients are easy
Why is it that I visit this page when logged out http://django-descant.rhcloud.com/static/descant/#/topic/244
Then there's a reply button
For linear gradients just use shader hacks
So I click on it and it disappears
TheBrokenKeeper: linear gradients can have more than one stop
Same goes for the "new topic" button
I know
You split generate new triangles and such
So if a gradient has two stops, from each stop you create a new set of things
A new set of trangles or something
i'm definitely going to have to just take the svg file
and turn it into vertices w/ draw commands
it's going to use too much cpu to calculate it every time
Cameron, probably a bug
I shall investigate
Which browser are you using?
how the hell did i get an e-mail from localhost?
Magic
:P
The server is getting confused and claiming that it's called localhost
And email clients don't verify
i'm guessing
that descant does not work properly on safari
Not tested
Maybe it works
Maybe it doesn't
Why is Safari still a thing?
Either way, if you want me to try and fix it, I need to know what's broken and which version you're using
nope
it won't let me post a topic on any browser
it says error :(
Did you log in?
yes
Did you follow the verify link?
Go to the developer console and chek out if there's any errors
i'll try following it in firefox
Also what Aurora said
is it supposed to be a blank page
with just the title bar?
Sounds like something's gone badly wrong
Is JS working?
Firefox, latest version
(stable)
Firefox 38
Yes JS is working
^
Cameron, I think I know your issue, Firefox was slow in getting a reply from the server and so Descant assumed you were logged in
Then realised that you weren't
Ichiru, Aurora01, TheBrokenKeeper: http://puu.sh/ioslG/59dc2db469.png
Surely it should assume you're logged out, since the majority of visitors will be?
splitty_ :D
It should, but Angular is being odd
I.E. default buttons and stuff to display:none and show them when you're verified?
splitty_: Awesome thing you're working on
:)
It's set to ng-show if authorised
splitty_ Why windows though
But for some reason, it assumes if there's no response, that equals true
Because I wrecked my bootloader and because I am playing Black Ops 2 with my sister sometimes. :D
There must surely be a way of changing that
I will log it on the issue tracker to fix when I get chance
It will work under Linux too.
Your sister plays BO2, I'm amazed.
^^
I need to get the game jsut to see how good it is on a PC
My sister ran Linux until her laptop died
But I don't have the money
I have BO2 on my PS3. But I can't play with a controller
Ichiru, so is it still appearing blank?
TheBrokenKeeper: https://github.com/CallumDev/AudioSharp
For when you want to add music to your game engine
Instead of 'You've made it to the last reply!' can it just say 'No more replies!'? Seems a little pointlessly long-winded
Eh, I set it to that but Aviv changed it
I think for the Chinese translation I put it as
"This is the last reply"
Ichiru: Where'd you find this?
Also makes it sound like it was some kind of epic quest to get to the last reply which may or may not have seen me dead
TheBrokenKeeper: I wrote it
Cameron, well it was
Interesting
What can it do?
You have to battle against the hordes of bugs
In order to reach the last post
Easter egg: if you try to navigate away or close the tab before reaching the final post, you get a confirmation dialogue saying "Looks like you didn't make it to the final post. Rest in peace. [OK] [Cancel]"
Plus, my error messages are so helpful
"Error!"
xD
To be fair, I don't even verify what the error was
As long as the AJAX didn't reply HTTP 200, it just says "Error"
Blind debugging there
And you have to figure out what went wrong
To be fair, Chrome Developer Tools allows you to see what actually went wrong
Good ol' Angular
I just can't be bothered to practically double my AJAX code to write nice errors currently
AJAX isn't exactly fun anyway
Well, the alternative for me is even worse currently.
Since Descant is REST API-driven
So it'd mean that I'd have to write an extra HTML-emitting endpoint
Do you do any backend web development, Cameron?
Not much, no - I develop themes and stuff for Wordpress and I build any extra functionality for my clients' sites wherever needed but I haven't done any serious backend development
You should learn Django or something
bacon, TheBrokenKeeper and I all love it
Yeah it's something I'm interested in for sure, just a matter of finding the time
Yup
I've got a full time job, and out of hours I do my own freelance web design/development stuff for people, plus I'm learning to drive and working on a bunch of my own projects, mainly one which has nothing to do with websites or software development
What's your non-web design project?
Sex toys
Plus I'm trying to be more sociable because I basically didn't go outside last year and I was pretty fucked up by the end of it, broke up with my girlfriend and everything, so I actually try to see my friends now haha
What bacon said
Eh, who needs the outside
Seriously though that's a secret but I'm sure you'll all find out soon enough
It's cold and rainy anyway
True #england
Actually it's pretty warm at the moment what are you on about?
Grey though for sure
Raining for me.
:P
You're up north if I recall
Further up than me anyway
Compared to you, yeah
Of course it's raining for you
Not Scotland-level or anything though
It's raining here, raining moneu.

Anywhere north of Birmingham is considered arctic
To us Northamptonshire peasants
Birmingham is hell though
Birmingham is alright
Horrible place
I saw Fall Out Boy there last year
And I'm seeing them there again in October (VIP AW YISS)
Also saw Korn there in January (with VIP again, wat is money lol) and I went to Spring Fair at the NEC in February as part of my job
Going to Autumn Fair in September too... So basically I don't mind Birmingham because I only ever go there to do cool shit at the big venues
xD
Capitalist... wait never mind.
This is the first weekend in like a month where I haven't cooked bacon
Such a let down
Argh, why is firefox so slow to fetch CSS
TheBrokenKeeper, what's your oper password?
Chrome does it practically instantly, but there's a visible unstyled flash with Firefox
bacon: 'secure'
I need it for someone.
Thank you.
Haha
bacon: As Aurora said
PM
XULRUNNER MORE LIKE XULWALKER AMIRITE LOL
Why?
Cameron: +1
geckofx.org would have liked that
RIP
We need a GeckoFX reunion
Repperoni in pepperoni
We actually do
Remember when all everybody did was make browsers?
Chrisco occasionally appears
Quantum is dead
Hloy carp I only ever see him on deviantART
Simek is still around
dodgeball disappeared
I'm friends with Tomsoftmedia and Proto on Facebook
Azure comes here sometimes
Proto appears occasionally
Tomsoftmedia never appears
Yeah he's some madskillz Vietnamese DJ now I think his software days are over
Aurora01: ahahaha
I'm also friends with forte on Steam
forte?
Yeah, forte comes rarely
memories.

I may be friends with some others but I have forgotten their names on Steam/FB
I'm sure I was friends with dodgeball once... And Azure
Azure comes
oh.
Aurora said that.
Fuck you, Aurora. I'm shipping you to an African Tribe.
lol human trafficking
shh..
Bring back some heroin Aurora
Back?
AURORA'S GENDER, CONFIRMED.

To the whole discussion
We need drugs
Just deleted the TDF group on Facebook because I was the only remaining member
HOW COULD YOU
Remember when we'd all insist Chrisco was a girl and piss him off to no end?
Or I'd get into huge religious debates with him
Where's Chrisco been lately?
I changed Zychro's gender to female.
Didn't I do that once on TDF then he 'reported' me to Simek for bullying him?
xD
We need to get some active people back again on the forum
Yeah, we need some people here so they can find my projects and make me rich
:P
jk
Idk he's super busy with life and stuff
He's a super billionaire now, Cameron.
Well.
In training.
He just needs $0 999 999 50.
more
Probably
Or just a devout Christian preacher
Let's denate.
deonate.
donate

Haha
Cameron, please no.
bacon, what sort of counting system is that?
Billionaire wannabe system.
ignore the 0
Which 0?
:P
...
First.
$0 999 999 5
Perfect
Haha
It turns out that Angular 2.0 will be released soon.
Which is non-backwards-compatible
And I've been using 1.4
HOORAY
FULL CODE REWRITES
(or just ignore it and keep using 1.4)
:P
Hello
Hi Aviv.
http://django-descant.rhcloud.com/static/descant/#/topics test the theme changing there
And provide feedback, please.
The changer is in the user cp next to the language changer
I'm sure it wouldn't be too difficult to port over to 2.0 if it was worth the effort
Well, apparently it's changing a *lot*
Oh well, doesn't matter, Angular 1.4 will do.
Oh
Good bye for a short time

This is a node
I'll have lists of nodes and then a root point for all the lists
Interesting
Overridding == is kind of unnecessary though
Because its a struct
It's for a good cause XD
How would you access a subnode?
Because I think there is a problem with this
Cameron, I think I may have found the cause of your bug
It's weirder than I thought
As you can see, currently nodes can only contain one element of type: byte, short int, long or string
But what about subnodes?
Apparently, it seems like ngAnimate was catching the hide directives, and delaying them for some reason
Viperidae: A node inside a node? Not yet xD
I'll do that in a bit
But why should I have a node inside a node?
This will be a terminal thing
Ah so it's your bloody gimmicks messing things up ;)
Viperidae, this struct is a terminal point
Uhm, /map/player/inventory. /map/computer/on ? I can think of a thousand reasons, NBT is like that
Map is a list of nodes, player is a list of nodes, inventory is a list of nodes
I haven't implemented that part yet
I can't focus for more than 10 minutes at a time
YAY
http://puu.sh/iovrZ/affb4b11fc.png
Cameron, it would have worked fine but Aviv removed the animation
It works with more complicated stuff too
Which weirdly seemed to break other stuff
Well then a Map, and a player, and an inventory all have to have a root node? Ohterwise is just bad design.
Viperidae: There will be: root, lists of nodes and nodes which are terminal values
They will be lists, named
But why the hell would you not have subnodes
Honestly, I think this is a bad design.
Tell me the use for a subnode?
Because there is just no reason what so server to not have subnodes
If you can store a list of nodes
You can make a list, which can store a node in it, or another list...
Yes, you can work around the fact that you don't have subnodes, but that doesn't mean you should
Look at Minecraft's NBT format
Look at JSON
Look at XML
If XML didn't let you go
<something>
<somethingElse>
<someTypeOfValue value="something/>
</somethingElse>
</something>
Then it would be pretty stupid
Yeah, it'd be like an INI format otherwise
^
But you can have a list...
Which is a useless format
list:
list:
item
idem2
I suppose that'd work, JSON does that
Can you have dictionaries?
All I currently have is: numbers and strings
I forgot to add floating points too
So yeah
Aurora01: How to make a stream from a byte array
TheBrokenKeeper: new MemoryStream(myArray);
Found it
Viperidae, pm
sorry, I'be been AFK
Viperidae: Nested nodes: http://pastebin.com/hW1jitBF
That might not work if you don't change it to a class
I already tested it and it does
Output: ("test",Node):("test",String):Hello World!
NodeStruct.Encode(new NodeStruct("test", NodeType.Node, new NodeStruct("test", NodeType.String, "Hello World!")), new BinaryWriter(stream));
stream.Position = 0;
Console.WriteLine(NodeStruct.Decode(new BinaryReader(stream)));
Viperidae, look
Alright, how do you access nodes though?
Like
I don't yet
How would you open a subnode, changeit, then rewrite it
Oh, well I'm saying you might have trouble with that
If you want to do somsething like
saveFile = SaveFile.Open("something");
SaveFileNode someNode = saveFile.OpenSubnode("something");
someNode.SetValue("something", 1);
saveFile.Save();
Do you understand that this is just a node inside a file, right?
I'll have to rewrite the file
I can't make fixed-length strings
Hello!
Fixed length strings are overrated, TheBrokenKeeper
I really don't get why I added subnodes
Because it's like common sense to add subnodes?
As if you want a subnode, it will be inside a list
As this is not an XML like format
But I'll keep them just to make you happy
Well then make an XML like format!
As you can see. There's no way to store multiple nodes
XML sucks balls
Also
WHY ARE YOU SO IGNORANT? This is one node. TERMINAL. Does the word TERMINAL mean anything to you?
Inside this, you won't have two items
You can only have one value in one node
That's it
Or multiple nodes in a list of them
Well then
I swear to god the next time you call me ignorant your day of reckoning will be at hand boy
Viperidae. Inside of this node, you cannot store multiple things
One value per node.
Why do you need subnodes?
Why next things? It's like your obsession of brackets
So then you're format is basically a glorified INI format :/
Can you store lists in INI?
Also, look at json:
I accidentally rewrote BinaryFormatter >.>
Ichiru, what is your opinion on TBK's save format?
i don't get it
{
"firstName": "John",
"lastName": "Smith",
"isAlive": true,
Viperidae, this is not a save file format for fuck sake...
This is a general file format in which you store data
Which was exactly what I meant
"thing": "value"
In JSON
Now stop arguing semantics, I find you becoming increasingly more unpleasant.
It's a terminal
That's not a node then
Then what the fuck should I name it?
KVP? There is already a key-value-pair
I really should be sleeping
bye y'al
Value? A node implies that it could potentially have sub items.
It can
If you make it be a list...
A node can be a list, but not yet, I'm wasting time trying to excplain things to you instead of working on things
For fucks sake TheBrokenKeeper, A FUCKING LIST IS WHAT I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS ENTIRE TIME
And I told you at least a dozen times that my file can and will have lists...
No
You didn't
You said nested nodes, that's different from lists
Uhm, no it isn't and I'll tell you why
17:40 <TheBrokenKeeper> You can only have one value in one node
17:40 <TheBrokenKeeper> That's it
17:40 <TheBrokenKeeper> Or multiple nodes in a list of them
You know YML?
17:15 <TheBrokenKeeper> You can make a list, which can store a node in it, or another list...
Did I not tell you about lists?
I know that YML exists, I don't know what it looks like
YOU made it look like there was one root list
Yes, there is one root list, in which everything goes
And that just has key value pairs
No
It can hold multiple lists
And none of those key value pairs can be a list
Then I won't show you incomplete things next time
And the source code you sent me does not imply that you have lists at all
atleast like the ones you describe
I don't yet
As I said, incomplete code
For the past 36 minutes I've been talking instead of implementing lists
Well then I've been write this entire time. Subnode == list? I just said you should add that because the format would be useless without
You never said that a subnode should be a list
That's the problem
Oh
Uhm, no the problem is you refused to adequately explain what a list is, because I had no reason what so ever to think you were describing is the same thing I'm describing. I made it clear what I meant, you should be able to have a file that contains data in the structure of a tree
rootSubnode:
key1 = value1
key2 = value2
childSubnode:
key3 = value3
childSubnode:
key4 = value4
I call that a root list, child list and such
Well, they will actually be nodes containing lists
But you get the idea
Everything's a node
But it's not even a list, it's closer to a dictionary but I'm saying everything is a node, including 'lists'
With a root node being a list, and inside it can be other nodes containing whatever
ok
It's a list of nodes. And a node has a name and a value
The list is not named that's why you need to assign it to a node
But the list itself is a node!, just like a grouping operator like {} in C# would be a node in the AST
Yes

you should learn JehovaScript for this - this mean read the bible.
Argh, are you still arguing about this?
xD
We finished 9 minutes ago

TheBrokenKeeper, I forgot to mention that there are 1 or 2 other keys that need translating, if you wouldn't mind
:O
JavaScript was written by Jesus!

Aurora01: *
Thanks, TheBrokenKeeper.
It's easy enough XD
Descant!
ByeMyBB
Aurora01: do you think you could make it so that the first option in the locale and theme selectors aren't blank?
It was being tempremental before because the translate library wasn't returning the right value, but I'll take a look when I can
Aurora01 I'll do some more german translations later
Yay!
splitty_ is just that awsome
Thanks splitty_
Good bye now!
"good bye".ToUpper()
Node.js is actually useful for something, hooray!
But not for the thing it was originally intended to do.
Viperidae: I got your node lists
You happy?
Actually, I am happy as they are useful
But still
read it as nude lists
+1
http://pastie.org/private/2zuppeghmhsx0pargskma
That's the code
Looks pretty nice.
Now, I need to make the NodeList class better
As it has no wrappers around the list
I'll need to override the this statement... And that's about it
The indexer?
Yes
It's more an index accesser operator.
Okay...
unary of course.
postfix*
bacon: Should I use indices or the node's names?
um.
um
indices.
in my opinion
Okay, good idea
or both
overload it.
twice
Okay, good idea
and I'm too tired to continue giving good idea
my brain is turning off.
ideas*
Okay
Suddenly, my game engine and game uses 41.1 MB of RAM instead of 53.7 like usual
And it's consistent
Each time I reopen it, 41 MB dead on, nothing more, nothing less
AuroraEngine uses a whooping 0MB of RAM.
Aurora01, here's $1000 contract.
Now... I should try and save a map with this format... But I'm too lazy. I'll do it later
Who wants to write an editor for these kinds of files?
A simple list view with editable nodes?
splitty_?
yes?
oh
nope
I don't do GUI stuff
WHY?????
Can you do a console version?
Display nodes?
Uhm
What would I need to do
Make a viewer and editor for my file format?
Hmm why don't you do that :/
I know nothing about your file format
Seems fun but too bad I'm busy
And I am working on my CSON thing ^^
splitty_: http://pastie.org/private/2zuppeghmhsx0pargskma
File format is here
You can simply use that implementation
Just make the editor and viewer
bacon: Will you do it?
no
busy
splitty_ seems to hate me :(
Augment?
django is more important
Hm?
Was distracted
Wanna make a file viewer and editor?
$1000
/0
Hahah
Well, if you write it. When the engine gets money. I'll give your materialist ass the money
TheBrokenKeeper sorry there is so much stuff going on right know
:P
Afterwards?
Aurora01 I knew that you were gonna make a pirate translation for Descant
FOr some reason
lol
You don't need to design
Just drop a menu thing, a list view on the whole parent thing
And you're done

Overstock bought the domain names O.ly,  O.vu and  O.cr as well as the social networking handles of  twitter.com/O; vimeo.com/O and O.tumblr.com for 150 Bitcoins.
Wow
at least overstock is embracing bitcoin
You know, I will try and donate a lot of my money
Give all of my friends a place to live
Give loads of bonuses and such to all my employess
Or however you write the last word
You don't make money by wasting money.
How would I waste money by helping people?
I don't need hundreds of thousands of dollars
Because, people are imaginary.
It's about you.
Jokes aside, I would donate to open source communities & fund development.
bacon: Did anyone say when I was D/Cd?
18:54 <bacon> Jokes aside, I would donate to open source communities & fund development.
18:55 -!- TheBrokenKeeper_ [Chronos@thingy-dm4.gge.137.89.IP] has joined #int0x10
nope.
Okay
I would get all my friends decent places to live in. And give all my employees more money
If  you want loads of employees to make good things. Give them more money than everyone else
Sadly, it doesn't usually work like that, for multiple reasons.
I know
But look at google
They have break rooms
Lunch rooms
Gaming rooms
Everything rooms
Free gourmet chef.
unlimited database on people.
Ray Kurzweil
Like, for real. Who wouldn't want to work somewhere where you can fucking play video games in your break time
Because, 1) I don't agree with Google's monetary morals. 2) I don't play video games.
I know they have to make money money somehow, I just find it creepy.
I love Google.
I hate Google.
It's a love-hate relationship.

It's now available for C#, PHP and Node/iojs
The PHP and Node/iojs version can only generate keys and ids, the C# version can do some more interesting stuff

Does anyone need a Malwarebytes Anti-Malware premium key? 100% handcrafted and made in Germany
I can provide keys for a specific ID
If you want a key for the id AAAAA, I can generate it!

Hola, splitty_
Hay
Aurora01, we need to talk. xD
PM me then
If necessary
Not really necessary
Let's talk in #descant
k
:P
splitty_, Aurora01: Wanna reverse engineer my file? It's very easy. For real, it's not complicated nor encoded
For anyone who's interested: http://we.tl/p0Lz8VYxts
BITCHES
WHO IS C? WHO THE FUCK IS C? WHO THE FUCK IS STEALING MY INITIAL?
Your nan.
There
I fixed it for you
Happy?
Viperidae, you here?
Hello, Cameron.
Aurora01: Soo... wanna take a look at my very amazing file?
Alright
http://we.tl/p0Lz8VYxts
There's a file
Fire up a hex editor and explore :D
I AM HAPPY
ALSO FUCK YOU NAN YOU LEATHERY OLD BITCH
ALSO Hi Aurora :3
FUCK YOU VIPERIDAE FUCK YOU
FUCKING BYE
Anyone else excited about Dishonored 2?
No idea what Dishonoured 1 is, but weirdly, it's something that I am familiar with.
Game about assassins
Promising field.
Well, an assassin... Based in some steampunk Victorian type era, you're this guy who was bodyguard to the queen of some plague-ridden land but the corrupt Lord Regent sets you up and kills her and everyone thinks it's your fault
So the whole thing is basically about revenge and taking back power
It was ridiculously fun and there were a bunch of ways you could play it
Cameron: That game is on my top 10 games
bacon: Get your ass and reverse engineer my file format. Please :)
Brilliant isn't it? Definitely up there somewhere for me too :3
Yup
TheBrokenKeeper, that sounds fun but too bad I cannot stray on my duties.
from my*
It's very simple...
It won't take more than 5 minutes to do
http://www.speedtest.net/result/4434728303.png
If that's the case then you should perhaps improve it anyway
Cameron: What do I have to improve?
Viperidae: That... KILL YER ISP BEFORE I KILL YOU.
TheBrokenKeeper, five minutes is still enough distraction from more important tasks.
The fact that it can be reverse engineered in 5 minutes?
Cameron: Splitty will write me the encryption part
Awlrighty
This is more or less a JSON like thing but in binary format
I find it interesting that you can play as either Emily or Corvo on Dishonored 2... That's hinting at co-op for me
Wait what?
Dishonored 2?
Dishonoured was ok, didn't like the lack of non lethal options though
I.e. sleeping darts or nothing
JESUS FUCKING CHRIST: http://i.imgur.com/TAGY2FV.jpg
Augment: There are non lethat ways of doing things
Like... Dishonored 2... Amazing!
YES DISHONORED 2

Fuck
I fucking hate my fucking router
I can't fucking open all ports
It only lets me open specific ports
splitty_: Don't you have a DMZ option?
Fucking piece of shit
DMZ?
I can set an IP to be in the DMZ
Which means all ports are open
Deminitarized zone
I can't.
The FritzBox doesn't have that feature
Well sucks to be you XD
Aviv's improved theme looks nice
http://django-descant.rhcloud.com/static/descant/#/
Wow
He really made it looks nice
look*
Hello ant.
Hello!
Aviv: You made a great looking theme for Descant
And Hello!
Hooray and hello TheBrokenKeeper!
Like, really... it looks awesome
Hello Aviv.
Hello Aurora01
I love your upgraded theme too
Yay thanks y
'all!
Does it have soft shadows under the menu bar?
Or are my eyes playing tricks on me?
yes
they are playing tricks on you
Or chrome is being weird
IE4ever
My eye sight is degrading because of over 16 hours spent in front of a laptop monitor daily
oh ok
oh gosh chrome is putting this terrible blue outline around active inputts
inputs*
Aren't you using normalize?
I am
Shouldn't that stop those problems then?
Aurora01, do you remember what mobo I had on my PC?
I said that I hate it a bunch of times
The Terribleboard 1
Found it!
No, it doesn't do anything about that, Aurora01
Aurora01: This is my shitty motherboard: http://www.gigabyte.com/fileupload/product/2/4385/6894_big.jpg
Haha
well, it'll go away in opera, chrome's just being weird about it
Guess they'll have to suffer for their browser choice
If Chrome is having trouble, Safari probably will break too
Plus Chrome is the biggest browser by far
It's just the input outline
and not by *that* much
48.15%
I'm getting a GTX 680 with 60 euros
Yay :D
The next highest is IE with 19.6%
It's usually 500 USD in stores
remember, Aurora01, monopolies are bad!
Fine, "Descant, best viewed in Midori"
lol
+1
Midori crashes whenever I try to open it
http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp is even worse for you Chrome-haters
Chrome - 64.9%
IE - 7%
Firefox - 21.5%
yuck
Chrome is awesome
May of 2003 seems like the best time ever
Ewwwww, IE6
The biggest abomination *EVER*
nuh
That would be Chrome.
Why do winforms suck so fucking much?
or maybe Vivaldi
Well TheBrokenKeeper, you won't need to use winforms much longer
At least Chrome follows standards properly
.. Ie does...
Not really
it's not like it has a million -webkit- things
It still has all of its weird quirks
Such as?
Conditional comments for one
lol
Those are gone
When did they get rid of them, IE10?
Aurora01: Update the Descant screenshot from the forums
It's old
Aviv, you heard TheBrokenKeeper :P
Important  As of Internet Explorer 10, conditional comments are no longer supported by standards mode.
ok TheBrokenKeeper
So that feature only died in 2012
:P
That doesn't mean IE now isn't standards compliant...
Loads of people still use old IE versions
So....?
That still doesn't make IE non compliant
Aurora01: Update the screenshot on int0x10
It's still less compliant than IE though
Take a look at html5test etc
TheBrokenKeeper: hold on
I'm holding on
I'm off to gaming.
done
:O Account pptosn.bxcweb.com is pending cancellation
As I say, Descantise their community
Yes, I've invented the verb 'to Descantise'
Because Descant is so revolutionary.
Is there any other Django forum out there
?
Yes
Misago
misago-project.org/
But is it made by Aurora and Aviv?
No
Then it's no good
Misago seems bad though
Descant is revolutionary.
Misago's next version will use Ember.js
and it looks like it is going super slow lol
I'm off to gaming for real this time
kk
Doesn't Misago currently use Ember?
Nope
it's just a static HTML page right now
Time to fix some of those CSS classes
.list-list really, Aviv
Such fun
.list-list is the best name.
lol
I think I'm going to merge forum.css and framework.css
Doesn't make much sense to separate the
m
and is this used anywhere?
button[disabled] {

Yeah
On the registration form
Should Descant get a https://gitter.im/?
If you like
It supports IRC connections, so it wins there
oh ok
Are you going to register for it?
I did
https://gitter.im/Aurora0000/descant
Well, that's neat
Try committing something to the v0.2-devel branch
Okay
Should I be scared?
ok
I committed something
<gitter> [Github] Tel-Aviv pushed 1 commit(s) to Aurora0000/descant https://github.com/Aurora0000/descant/compare/3b5a2c06ba3e...b271a51d4a33
It sent that to me
WHOA
Anyway, got to go now.
Adios.
BYE
Hi!
Yay I found a nice new IRC client!
Aviv: What client is that?
Aviv: 23:19 <TheBrokenKeeper> Aviv: What client is that?
A modern windows one called IRC Explorer!
Great... KILL IT WITH FUCKING FIRE!
No!
YES!
Never
Modern windows apps are the future
no winforms haha
Is that a plus to you?
No.
I thought you hated winforms
Clickable console with raster graphics is the guture
future*
uhm.
You just go on and think that then
Fuck modern Windows apps it's all about web apps
lol k
Which, granted, are based on the same technology... But shhh
Cameron: Can your web IRC hold logs?
Cameron: You are aware windows 10 will let you easily convert your web apps into modern windows like apps?
I'm off to playing some Bioshock
kk TheBrokenKeeper
go play*
I hate my grammar somethimes
And I hate Viperidae's almost always
I'm sure there are clients out there which can but this shitty webchat on the int0x10 site does fuck all
I always hate it
Their vs They're
It has like 10 buttons
Cameron: KiwiIRC is a web alternative
Or you can use Smuxi
And I am aware of that Aviv, but why should we need to? Why not just use... **drum roll** the internet?
Offline?
KiwiIRC was the first client I ever used, back when I was 12
That brings me back
I only use webchat because I really cba to find a better client
Cameron: Smuxi!
I used to use ChatZilla back when IRC was a fairly standard part of my life
SMUXI!!!
Yeah but I have to search it and install/sign up/whatever for it... Basically changing tabs is effort
Viperidae, Aurora, Bacon, splitty, Reagan, me and many more use it
And what do you have to sign up for?
It's free
yeah
But IRC Explorer for windows is better!
You donwload it, install it, add the server and run it
Windows is bad.
Not!
It's more of you are bad at using Windows
You live in a dream world
I know how to use Windows maybe even better than you
Sure
I've been using windows since I was 2 and a half years old
That's nice
Let's say for ~14 and a half years
You can use something for a long time and still be terrible at it!
And my dad was working in the computer industry
I learned everything from him
I'm better than him now
So yeah
that so totally qualifies you
How are you qualified for using Windows?
TheBrokenKeeper is 16 confirmed #confirmed
Do you have a license?
I have a Windows license but not that kind
Didn't you know that I'll be 16 on the 24 of June? This month?
I
Well I do now :D
I will probably forget that so I'll wish you a happy birthday now
I'm expecting sa present from each and every one of you
I have this kind of license: http://i.imgur.com/J6Ir99D.png
Yay!
It won't be sweet
I'm stuck on my bed with a cast on my leg unable to move 1 inch
HOORAY FUN
Nobody will come to my b-day
So yeah
Hopefully the day will be kind to you
It'll be fun...
I'd go!
I'd come if I could!
Well, you still got plenty of time
Aviv, it's only ~1k USD
yeah ok
Now, I'll play Bioshock
I was in Cornwall over my 16th... With my family (not by choice)... Granted it was a nice holiday but on my actual birthday, I got an ice cream and a fucking seagull stole it right out of my hands after the second lick
Then another one pissed on me at the beach
I wish I had that XD
What city in Romania?
I'm stuck between 4 walls using a shitty dual core laptop
LOL DUAL CORE
For the airport? Go to "Timisoara"
YOUR LIFE MUST REALLY SUCK
I'll go talk to my Romanian friend because AFAIK you guys can all turn into bats and teleport so I'll get him to teleport me over there
Well, my desktop is a six-core 3.9 GHz, 8 GB of ram, GTX 660 and 680
I bet you miss it dearly
I do
The 660 is dedicated purely for KVM and PhysX
Oh, wow, TTK, the flights are even more than that
Awesome@
!*
not
Now, I'll actually do something... Wathc youtube@
!*
Or you could work on Descant!
**TheBrokenKeeper picks up a photo album with some heavy-sepia pictures of him skipping through a field with a huge gaming rig** "Ah, the days when I had legs... I miss her so"
Aviv: I can't
Aurora didn't teach me it's inner workings
Believe, and it will happen
Nor do I know how to web-dev
Just believe
or learn to web dev that could be fun
or
SIGN UP FOR AVIV's fun webdev course!
Aviv: This is what I'm currently watching: https://goo.gl/zL48vv
or use the youtube built in short link?
https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
Don't know about it
just click share
Nice
Like this? https://youtu.be/Rqz--Rf6IIo
Btw, this time it's a different video
GJ TheBrokenKeeper
With?
Youtube links
Did you check it out?
Sure..
It's a prank video. from the channel "TrollarchOffice"
No, it was not
I know :D
..
It was from From Russia With Pranks
ok
Oh no
GOIN' TA BED NOW LADIES, NIGHTY NIGHT, GET WELL SOON THEBROKENKEEPER XO
Soon means 2 months earliest

YEAH WELL I HOPE THOSE TWO+ MONTHS ARE AS FUN AS THEY CAN BE
NIGHT
I'll sleep now
k
Night
Night!
Hello all
Viperidae Augment  Augment  bacon Emily  splitty__
Am I really sexy enough that you have to mention me twice?
thanks m7
that was meant to say Aviv
but I obviously didn't get the autofill right
yeahsure
we believe you :v
Hello
Hiya Nullz
How you doing?
hi Nullz!
Hello
Hi!!!
not many people are talking right now lol
not any*
3 exams down, 3 to go
Hi Aviv, bacon, Emily, Nullz, splitty__
Nice, and hello.
Taking a C course :D
Hey
lol Nullz
Nice
I just wrote my first C program! #1337
+1
Welcome to cludo games, We will strive to return 0 better than anyone else!
WOOOOOOO NULZZ
I AM SO PROUD
lol
This course is really short
it only goes over the super basics
But you did it
:D
You're better than anyone! (except viperiade duh)
but vippy can't be beat
HE has a special thing
Most people here are better than me >> lol
But I'm catching up! :D
Hello world
>> I now realize it wouldn't be so bad to have C as a scripting language in my game engine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-b6w4Nog5E
This video is so true
And Nullz, don't do that.
C as a scripting language doesn't work.
Most developers won't be professional C devs and they will make really problematic decisions.
^
yeah
Aviv a good amount of people here can write C code :D
Yeah I think everyone here other than me and Aviv know C and C+
C++*
I know C++
I use it every day
Really
I don't
I don't know C++
I do know C--
Much error
I dont understand tsi
I dont know what I did wrong but it works now
Wait, can y--- oh oh oh I tried to make a class constructor on accident lol
×¤×¢××××? × ×§×××ª×××?

Bye!
C isn't hard! So far!
already 40% done with course
Well C itself isn't hard
But pointers and stuff need some practice :D
The course hasn't gone over this atleast year
yet*
Why is it that I have to make a variable static to make it work? If I make a regular int data in one class and the same in my own class(something that'd work on every language I've used) why is it when I edit one it edits the other as if It was just a pointer to the same object?
Nullz you are confusing something lol
There ain't no classes in C :D
You can link them together though
Are you talking about headers?
./cl something.c /c
wtf
I have no idea what you're doing :D
Call me on skype
Can't, everyone is asleep
I wont talk
You have to make a variable static if you define them in a header and want to use them in multiple c classes.
It would be defined more than once if you'd not make it static
Yeah but why do you have to make it static?
OH
Okay. Imagine this: You have a js file that defines the variable x = 10
So you mean I can literally access te other classes variables just like that?
Wait.
Now you include this js file in two different files
x gets included twice
C just adds all of that together like it was one class huh
Yeah
Oh
I get it now :D
#include "something" just copies the contents :D
That's why you include just the headers, let the compiler find the classes and make things that will be included more than once static.
I now understand why it isn't object oriented, but it well I dont know how to make it can be yet
There is no way to write object oriented code in c.
But you can use structs to save/restore a state and pass that struct to a stateless function
You can if you know how to use structs! ~SomePersonOnThisIrcIForgetWhoSaidThat
That's how class-like things are achieved in C
I just said it. :P
And it probably was Viperidae
Anyways I like C but I appreciate C# more now
^^
okay its going over operators
I understand everything but then it started talking about >> and << and now I'm lost on what they do because what it says doesn't make sense to me
nvm
Nullz, it's bit shifting
1 << 1 = 2
2 << 1 = 4
4 << 2 = 16
I dont understand these words. xD I know ~ seems to make every value negative with a extra negative number
10 would be -11
2 >> 1 = 1
4 >> 2 = 1
4 >> 1 = 2
:D
Nullz, that's wrong
hrm
Well, maybe not in all cases
to numbers, yes~
<< = bitwise shift left
>> = bitwise shift right
~ = bitwise NOT
& = bitwise AND
| = bitwise OR
^ = bitwise XOR
With 4 << 2 = 16, that way you get this is you do (4*2)*2 ?
8 << 2 == 32
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation
Here
This makes it easy to understand
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#Arithmetic_shift
It's a really simple and basic operation
It's just harder to imagine this operation on base 10 numbers
In base 2, it makes sense and is very simple
K I sorta understand it. Why is this needed though.
Nullz, x << y == x * pow(2, y)
That's an interesting question. :D
are you wanting me to answer that?
Yeah sure
Multiplying/dividing using bitwise shift is faster than multiplying using normal * and / operators
I'm not entirely sure why
I'm not sure I know how to answer that.
haha
Me neither
Oh good I felt like I was stupid xD
xDD
Nope
bit-shifting is important. :D
You need it to generate hashes
You need it for polynomial arithmetic
You can make multiplication faster using bitwise shift
You can do floating-point arithmetic on systems that don't support floating point numbers
Also, it's important for low-level stuff
This all seems cool but I'm not sure I'm at the point where I need to understand it yet xD
Because hardware "encodes" stuff using bit-masks
And you can extract values using bit-shifting
Nullz it really isn't hard to understand
I understand what it does, I just can't see it used in a practical application
I needed it A LOT while doing OS dev. :D
http://puu.sh/iqDPI/0c6537de90.png
splitty___: Theoretically, you can do object oriented things in C
Even polymorphism
But you need to pass the instance statement
not statement
Variable
TheSleepKeeper that's what I said earlier
07:44 <splitty___> There is no way to write object oriented code in c.
You sure?
<splitty___> But you can use structs to save/restore a state and pass that struct to a stateless function
Right
You can't do that without using structs
would this result in 20: 5 >> 2
Yes
No
5 << 2 would result in 20
I'll be off to Winblows
Yes
5 >> 2 is 5 / pow(2, 2);
Right shift is division
Left shift is multiplication
x << y is (x*y)*y
A shot to the heart, and you're to blame. Now you give love, a bad name!
Nullz, 5 >> 2 is 1(2), 1(10) and 1(16) :D
5 << 2 is 10100(2) and 20(10)
more that half way through C course
Nullz, you can visualize this easily
5(10) is 101(2)
5 << 2 is 101, plus the two new zeros = 10100(2) = 20(10)
It's simple
Splittly I dont undestand binary or hexadecimal or whatever that is
dafuq
Binary is the simplest system to represent numbers
Hexadecimal is...
(Well the simplest would be base 1 but that's useless)
20 in base 1: ....................
Thinking in binary is too hard
20 in base 2: 10100
20 in base 10: 20
And the only statement it has used other than doing stuff with ints and operators(not showing demos, literally just saying what they do in some sort if language i seem to not understand) is printf
TheBrokenKeeper I find thinking in binary easier than thinking in hex
printf is nice
I understand numbers!
Am I the only one that can't calculate in binary in my head?
yes
no, not really
NO
xD
I cant
I can
I can only calculate in base 10, base 12 and base 16
Well maybe your a super human or something
TheBrokenKeeper why would one even consider using base 12
If 20 in base 10 is 20, then I am a pro at base 20
base 2, 8, 10 and 16 make sense.
Nullz, it isn't. :D
Base 12 is one of the most useful bases to use
That's right.
okay guys
The real question here is, whats a base?
You see my current understanding of a base is
Nullz, 20(10) should be 14(16)
How far you gotten with your girl friend
lol
splitty___: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6xJfP7-HCc
Your trying to 20*10 should be 14*16 right?
Not really
Watch the video that TBK just sent :D
TheBrokenKeeper I love how James is always smiling when talking about numbers
Yup
It's one thing to love numbers, but it's a whole different thing to not be scared about showing that you love numbers
Grammar sucks, you get the point
xD
base 12 seems legit
but what about base 64?
LOL
u mad
base 64 is useless.
A subset of base 64 is interesting for encoding characters for transfer over GET parameters.
But no sane person would use base 64 for calculating.
okay so, the numbers like 10100 is base 2 correct?
becuase you only have 0 and 1
would 30 be 10030
Nope.
no
There is only 0 and 1 in decimal
wait
10010
I forgot that
10010 = 30
?
nope
I made progress on understanding atleast
But I can't figure otu a number yet
Hello.
Hello bacon
Nullz, 30 would be 11110
Let's count to 30.
0000
0001
0010
0011
0100
0101
and I'm bored.
0110
0111
1000
1001
1000 - 8
1010
9
10
1011
11
1100
1101
1110
1111
I was joking.
Did I skip many?
xD
I cannot see it.
Yay :D
You skipped almost 30
xD
You skipped half of them. xD
lel
jk
splitty___: Wanna make that console based ChronFile viewer?
ChronoFile*
omfg this C course is so boring
00000, 00001, 00010, 00011, 00100, 00101, 00110, 00111, 01000, 01001, 01010, 01011, 01100, 01101, 01110, 01111, 10000, 10001, 10010, 10011, 10100, 10101, 10110, 10111, 11000, 11001, 11010, 11011, 11100
THere you go
Looks like I skipped one
But anyway
Almost complete
:D
oh I know why
11101, 11110
I skipped two. :D
Well, not skipped. Forgot.
@Nullz 00000, 00001, 00010, 00011, 00100, 00101, 00110, 00111, 01000, 01001, 01010, 01011, 01100, 01101, 01110, 01111, 10000, 10001, 10010, 10011, 10100, 10101, 10110, 10111, 11000, 11001, 11010, 11011, 11100, 11101, 11110
Here, enjoy that wonderful binary sequence from 0 to 30
Atleast I can tell its base 2
C is like the same syntax of C#
course: Goes over base 2 shit, barely does switch statement at the end because its "pretty hard"
C# is easy :D
Oh
yes
Didn't read it all
Well
yes its easy but not much harder. I think I'll like C++ more though
You'll work with bytes in C, if you want it or not.
C++ sucks. :D
Does C++ have a bool atleast?
Because
C doesn't have a book
bool
but yet, somehow it can do if statements
#define true 1
#define false 0
There
Does C++ have strings?
C has strings too
Well, it has char*
But still
C++ is just bad.
C++ has booleans and strings
But it's a bad language
It looks pretty cool right now actually
Once you start using it, you'll hate it
Alright
Nullz
#define true 1
#define false 0
There you go
splitty___: Look 2 minutes ago at what I said
3*
I mean I like C, I just wish its std was better and was object oriented
lel TheBrokenKeeper didn't see that sorry :D
Nullz, C++ has wchar_t :D
Also, Nullz, if statements are not boolean only
C++ has also std::string
...
also has*
But now, I'll be gaming
I'm gonna go to sleep
Goodnight
Night
.
Hey
Hello, splitty_.
hey splitty_
how's the CSS kernel?
Did not start writing it xD
Cameron: Soo... you play the guitar?
Awesome!
I started learning a couple of months ago, I still suck
Now, I'll be AFK
Well, I discovered the fate of my picks
Yeah although I still suck as well dw, I don't get much time to practice
https://twitter.com/SirBlackhand/status/610895574007615488
I'm here bitches!
Splitty_: I've decided to rewrite my file thing
Turn it into a library
Make it awesome
YOBITCH
A binary version os
Of*
Json or Cson
Cameron, who are you calling a bitch?
yer foken nan m7
YO
BITCH
Also, can I have that twitter link again?
https://twitter.com/SirBlackhand/status/610895574007615488
Thanks
I AM SUCH AN ARSE
ThePhoneKeeper, you've been beaten to binary JSON
WE KNOW
MongoDB made bson ages ago
I LITERALLY PUT THE PICKS IN THE TIN AND RECYCLED IT ON THE SAME FUCKING DAY, LIKE 20 MINUTES LATER
GG
THEN FORGOT ABOUT THEM FOR LIKE 2 WEEKS
GG M9
Luckily Amazon Prime will fix me up by Thursday :D
Aurora01, this will be better
I have a dozen or so picks laying around in my house
I hid one everywhere
Even in my pillows
Picks
Ewww
All the drawers in my house have at least one pick in them
Just awkward
Finger style Augment?
Yus
Classical?
Probably because I started on nylon classical
Yeah
For starters
That's a good idea
Then you'd always know where to find one
I just ordered 12 and they're getting a damn good home
Well, I started on rusty steel acoustic strings... Like literally rusty. My fingers were full of rust after playing
And because of that I ordered an electric guitar
I now have polymer coated stron
Stings*
Strings*
Strings**
Let me get word prediction back
Yeah I went straight to electric
There, better :D
I can see myself being a rhythm guitarist because I wanna shred but I doubt I'd be good enough to do all the riffs and stuff on lead
I'll make the best file format in the world!
With a nice editor
I have a great design in my head
Very modular
As they will be used as an all around file format for everything, from textures to save files, map files and such
It'll have to be as modular as I can make them
And the editor too
I have a basic design in my head, but I need to get it in code form
Augment, will you use them to save data in all of your C# projects?
Nope.
I assure you will after you'll see it's desing
Design*
Most of my projects at the moment either interact with normal formats (e.g. Dement, which fucks with image files) or uses CRAPI for storage
Y u no auto correct you piece of shit
The HTC One M9 is a great phone, but it sometimes pisses me off
Probably because you haven't got it set to autocorrect?
I have
It works when it wants to
Afk
Back
Cameron, do you program?
Aye, not a huge amount but I do a fair bit of JavaScript, PHP and C#
aka no
Interesting
I build/maintain some software at work for our research and meetings and stuff
aka no
real programmers don't exist.
Bacon, will you use my file format when it will be released?
they're just shells for b acon
Sure, in 100 years.
It'll be awesome!
It uses Amazon/eBay/Google APIs and has some of its own lil' frameworks and stuff to manage users, generate agendas for meetings, etc
Now, ask again
Afk
APIs are sooooooo 2014, I now run a cable to Google.
well...
it's a wire
and two foam cups
and I get no response.
..
...
Night, people.
Tired.
Night
PHP
DIE
!!!!!
Well, got to go now.
Bye
NIGHT BACON
Looks like it's just us guys now AH AH AH AH AH
....
heeeeeeelp~
Augment. I'll help you
Just give me 1000 doge coins and you'll get help
And he doesn't ask what with. Poor, misguided person
Well, 1000 dogecoins
is like
12 pence
lol
ThePhoneKeeper officially world's cheapest hooker
I'm not a hookah, I'm a good citizen
Well, you just offered to 'help' me for a fee :v
Soyeahhhhh
Would you want some help with hiding a body? Siri can help you
Augment, do you know how to piano?
Nope
Piano roll FTW
in face
*fact
Working in audio ftw
...
I mean, my Masada remix is more or less entirely sample manipulation
You are the cheapest person in the world for that
Why?
Piano roll is plague. The only true way is to record midi
Ah, but it's so much quicker
And easier
Particularly given my workflow, which generally involves bouncing to samples early
It's not...
and just using the piano roll for pitch bends for the source sound
(melody? Who needs it? :P)
6smexy9him
ikr
I'm back
Hi TTK
If anyone uses Sublime Text 3 and is a fan of material design... http://equinusocio.github.io/material-theme/
This looks amazing
And it seems to be inspired from Solarized
As I was saying, TheBrokenKeeper, my workflow really isn't MIDI-based enough to need to worry about how I input MIDI data.
https://www.dropbox.com/s/iu565k9654grrri/Screenshot%202015-05-05%2007.40.39.png?dl=0
4 midi tracks.
In this entire project.
Cameron: http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized
3 of which are subs, one of which is a pad layer.
Solarized isn't bad but nothing on that material one :3
I don't get how people use FL Studio
Easily enough
It has a sane UI, unlike, say, Ableton
I mean...
Pro Tools?
Patcher's interface for routing, compared to Ableton instrument racks. Patcher hands down.
Easily crackable?
CuBase?
Interesting
Easily crackable, frankly, is an upside for someone with no cash like me.
I'm talking about Pro Tools
Cameron, I've seen this theme on dribbble a few months ago :D
Cubase, I've used one or twice. Cluttered and unwieldy.
ProTools and Cubase are a bitch to crack
I hate Cubase XD
Definitely Dribbble-worthy, splitty_
yeah :D
Never touched protools, but it doesn't seem capable of a lot of thigns FL is
No ProTools is solid as fuck
See-also: Routing formulae
It's just hard to get working, let alone crack
See-also: No patcher equivalent
They have really weird hardware requirements
See-Also: More awkward workflow for resampling
FL Studio is good if you can figure out how to use it for more than just basic sequencing, the functionality is there, just a bit hidden
Again, SONAR is pretty good, I think it's on Steam now as well
SONAR, the new versions suck
The version made in 2006 was the best one
Cameron: The functionality's not hidden at all
FL just stays the hell out of the way, and that's how things should be
I mean compared to all the standard sequencing stuff
Took me a while to realise you could double-click a note to see its specific options
Seriously?
Or figure out how to pitch bend
Yeah I didn't follow a tutorial that's not how I roll
Nor did I
Hence my projects always end up being a clusterfuck of sampling
and filter automation and other such good times
Haha
I tend to use instruments where I can and the best VSTs I can find otherwise
For example, Addictive Drums for drums... Ace VST
And their website is hella sexy http://www.xlnaudio.com/addictivedrums
True, but who needs accoustic drums
Everyone...
When you can just sequence a bunch of real nice once from, say, NHF
As flat audio, in the playlist
like a man
(NHF sample pack drums = <3)
THIS IS BADASS: http://9gag.tv/p/aVY6N3/microsoft-hololens-minecraft-e3-2015-minecraft-holographic-demo?ref=fbl9

Night ladies xo
Night bitches.
So yeah, night all
Hi!
Hi splitty__
Hey Aviv
hiiii
CSS Kernel?
CSS is the best
bits-32 {
global: start;
}
start {
Hmm
That didn't work well
https://gist.github.com/Tel-Aviv/1473a7f130a3cd8ef914
That's better
Aviv, I'd prefer LESS-Style
lol LESS looks like CSSa
Are you thinking of SASS?
Dont you love it when your power turns off for 30 mins
^
Aviv I'm working on the LESS thing :D
woo
It'll be weird as fuck, but awesome
Ok
But why LESS?
Because it allows variable declaration
lol ok
Like #define
In Assembly code
I do love it Nullz
Aviv: https://gist.github.com/SplittyDev/4338030e7fbd8b9f3ac2
lol that's amazing splitty__
I used to think C/C++ is hard
CSS is even harder
xDD
Viperidae, we're writing a kernel in CSS/LESS
But then I actually played with C and it isnt that hard. I then saw whatever that is and I dont understand one line on it xD
It's simple CSS. Kernelized CSS: :D
WOO
Kernelized.CSS
splitty_: wut
Aviv: Updated it
https://gist.github.com/SplittyDev/4338030e7fbd8b9f3ac2
It's now 100% LESS compatible
Viperidae, Aviv came up with the weird idea of writing a kernel in CSS
The original is on my github
Great! Now someone just write a CSS assembly preprocessor
That's what I'll do :P
https://github.com/Tel-Aviv/CSS-Kernel
Aviv's original version is just some stuff that will never work
But my gist could actually work
yeah
Hahaha
Apparently.
CSS is turing complete
xDD
Woo!
now all you antiwebdev people can learn CSS!
Kind of...
But... I could just use nasm
lolno
I'll ask Richard Stallman if he wants to write GNU CSSAS
ok
jk
I'll do it.
lol http://forum.nasm.us/ needs descant badly
ascss or cssas (name not decided yet) will be the css to assembly compiler
Write a kernel with a built in VBA interpreter
OMG YES!
That would be so good
ccss will be the ccss to c compiler.
Or I'll fork GCC and rename it to GCCSS
xDD
C to css.. How the hell would that even work xD
I mean
and then make a XML to assembly preprocessor!!!
css to C
Viperidae, no idea. I'll come up with something
So then PPT can make an OS
Nah Aviv, I'll write an PPTX to C converter
jk, of course
nope
you can't take that back
you're doing it!
I'm splitty, I can take anything back
:P
^
Bitmap to C++
programming with pixels
any comments on thaT?
Uhm, I've seen people write programs in paint xD
Nullz: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYLm8uclr0I (This wasn't what I was looking for though)
No like
Seriously make a interpreter that instead of loads string it loads a bitmap
That wasn't the video I was talking about, I saw someone make a Hello World COM file in paint or something
Nullz I am pretty sure that there is an esoteric language out there that works with bitmaps
https://gist.github.com/SplittyDev/4338030e7fbd8b9f3ac2
Viperidae, does this look legit? :P
I am pretty sure that I can turn this 100% valid LESS code into 100% valid AT&T assembly
Hahahah, yeah I don't know about the CSS part; but it looks legit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtQdIYUtAHg
AT&T assembly
woo AT&T
best company ever!
thank god there isnt a microsoft service provider..
Google Fibre is the future, I wish my city had Google Fibre
Comcast will be rolling out 1gb in my area
this year
I'll be able to host servers once I finish my computer if I can figure out how to protect my self from DDoS D:
:D*
I really hope Microsoft becomes a service provider
BUT NULLZ
why host at home when we have Microsoft Azure?
Eww
I wonder what SHA1 sounds like
Its not free/already paid for
30 day trial at least ;)
http://wurstcaptures.untergrund.net/music/
nope
That moment when it feels like it works but you dont know for sure.
just use windows kk?
Windows needs to die
I really hopes Micro$haft fucks up with Windows 10
oh shit
I just realized my new computer wont be able to support linux
lol they won't Viperidae
you're just jelly because NT is better than infinity
But...
Infinity is not linux
Nullz: Why? What the hell kind of computer are you buying?
t * ((t>>16|t>>9)&666&t>>6)
The motherboard doesnt have linux drivers
yay
What the hell kind of motherboard is that. This is why proprietary drivers MUST DIE.
Dont worry viper
I'll still get the linux
On this computer + teamviewer + ipad
I'm just saying, it's fucked up that proprietary drivers exist
lol
Not really

Proprietary software is evil
#WhatWouldStallmanDo
yeah i completely agree with viper on proprietary DRIVERS
(not the software part)

My users do not have freedom. They are now my little slaves. I control them now.
There parents mean nothing to hem for I am there REAL parents now.

Throught out my efforts of looking for a funny "I control you now!" video I have found some people actually believe mind control is possible. lewl

I would love to do that but the algorithm to do that is probably really complicated. :D
Aviv: because of you everyone is moving on, good job.
Huh?
hmm?
Hey slackroad
heu
jeu
FU
hey*
splitty__:
why two underscores now?
Each underscore makes me twice as awesome
*world explodes*
but I live
Hey look! slackroad is now a method in python!
xDD
Good one
xDDDD
Yay slackroad method!
Aviv I wonder if you'd manage to write a working "Hello, World!" kernel if I'd provide you with the tools
Maybe.
LOL
ALLAHU AKBAR!
You'd need to write the asm stub and a basic terminal that writes to 0xB8000;
IDEK what any of those mean
How about if it is a CSS kernel?
It's useless to write a css to asm/c compiler if nobody uses it.. lel
lel
Not really splitty__!
It's for the fun of programming as Viperidae calls it
I'd rather write my kernel in VB6 than in CSS
^
whaaaa
Why not write a kernel in PHP?
There is just so much useless wrapping going on to make it CSS compatible
mov { a: ref(address(eval(0x31))); b: register(eax); }
vs mov $0x31 %eax
:(
https://youtu.be/LrH1Y7Jf59E?t=195
How about you do it for JacoScript then?
Or Iodine?
JacoScript is the best
Hell, splitty__
you're wasting your time,
you should work on Tel
instead of this
Tel is the platform of the future
Forget twitter
Tel is what's new!
Tel is like Twitter with SQL injection, isn't that good?
I think TTK would like it
^
We should take over Tel while Reagan is away
Want to?
Join #tel, then!
Nah
It's too easy
I need something challenging. Hacking tel is not something I'm interested in ^^
I did it before and I could do it again. But.. meh
wow.
That disconnect.
Well..
I've been tasked with protecting Reagan's assets while he is gone
What is the last thing I said that got sent?
lol Viperidae :D
21:53 <splitty__> I did it before and I could do it again. But.. meh
ah okay good
So
I called Courtney a stupid whore
lol
Why?
I don't know if she heard me though xD I think she did, Castiel and I drove by her (She was walking away from school with some guys) and I asked him to roll down his window, then I was like "You're a stupid whore!" or something; then Castiel speed off.
:D
In that case I will have a look at tel
Good job viperidae :D
Wow that was mean
So let's look for issues in TelBoard!
Doesn't look like there's much wrong with auth.php :(
That isnt mean aviv
It's a mean thing to say
If you knew what she did to viper you'd think different
Yeah ^
https://github.com/JacobMisirian/TelBoard/blob/master/TelBoard/board.php#L60 lol what is he doing here?
He's making a brand new MySQL connection just to get replies...
Aviv, hint: There is no sql injection vulnerability
(At least none that I know of)
yeah me too
You should focus on cross scripting
But another connection for another MySQL query is just like why
^^
and why does he rename $query to $rquery???
He is learning.
But that should be obvious?
And I have absolutely no idea.
xD
Well
Hm
I think I see something a little SQL inject-y
I will further investigate
I can understand his PHP code more than his C# code
No, but what he's doing is still bad practice
Silly Jacob, Tel is for kids!
Yeah its a like a 4chan
lol this is great here: https://github.com/JacobMisirian/TelBoard/blob/master/TelBoard/do-login.php#L27
He's going through EVERY user to find a match for a username
Hasn't he heard of MySQL's WHERE function?
Apparently the answer is yes because he uses elsewhere
so this is just really bad coding
IDIOT
It doesn't make anyone an idiot, Viperidae!
Just more encouragement
Can you do that Viperidae?
I've found the first thing about windows
Read how to SQL, yes
I can do that xD
Why does he literally comment every line
//Start the session
session_start();
/Start the session
No shit
You should tell him this stuff
I did
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzt6qz1YzrI
lel
He never listens to me though, and if I talk about anything he doesn't know he gets scared over it.
Damn, Reagan isn't here to start an int0x10 religious fight
lol
Can I take his place?
No
Darn
Aviv, what are you religious believs? :D
lol I comment almost literally every line too, Viperidae
I believe that believs is not a word
But other than that
oops
xDD
beliefs*
Let's see now, what are they...
http://pastebin.com/ih85yM6q hows this viper?
Not bad, I'd personally though use if/else instead of that one switch (The switch is kind of silly on a boolean)
if(YIncentments) {
} else {
}
ah true
xD didnt think of that, thanks. Anything else?
Hmmm, not too much else, it looks good but I'm no gamedev
Also
I'm writing fizz buzz in assembly because of Aviv
You're welcome
if ($message == "" || $message == " " || $name == "" || $name == " ")
I guess Tel lets you have messages with multiple spaces?
splitty___!!!
Good news!!!
Tel does support SQL injection!
Damn
I just ate 11 pieces of toast
7 of them with meat salad
2 of them with jam
And 2 of them with honey
#rekt
Hey splitty___
Hey.
You found a SQL injection? :D
Oh yes
It's a very good one
Where?
I've wrote fizz buzz before but i forget what it was
Yay Aviv I'm almost done
yay
for(var i=1;i<=100;i++){Console.Write("{0}\n",i%3?"fizz":i%5?"buzz":i);}
Here. My implementation in C# :D
You have to ask the user for input though xD
lol why?
The user is supposed to answer whether or not i is fizz, buzz, or fizz buzz
ooh
I looked it up on wikipedia.
Fizz buzz has been used as an interview screening device for computer programmers.[2][3] Creating a list of the first 100 Fizz buzz numbers is a trivial problem for any would-be computer programmer, so interviewers can easily sort out those with insufficient programming ability.
There is a really bad example implementation in js, which just prints out the number, fizz or buzz.
splitty___ https://github.com/JacobMisirian/TelBoard/blob/master/TelBoard/do-reply.php
Ah, ok. I was reading the first section that just said
Players generally sit in a circle. The player designated to go first says the number "1", and each player thenceforth counts one number in turn. However, any number divisible by three is replaced by the word fizz and any divisible by five by the word buzz. Numbers divisible by both become fizz buzz. A player who hesitates or makes a mistake is eliminated from the game.
In a for loop.
For example, a typical round of fizz buzz would start as follows:
Wow
Well then
I guess this interactive fuzz buzz was a waste of time xD
xD
Yeah
lol
Sorry :P
Can anyone beat my one-liner? :D

Better than what I could've done!
Did you see the SQLinjection splitty___?
I'm taking a look at it now
$mstmt = $conn->prepare('UPDATE messages SET replied="true" WHERE id=' . $_GET['id']);
bad bad bad
FOOLD
Also why is he using oop here and every where else not oop?
Jacob barely knows how to OOP
Even in C#
LOL
But
It's
not
hard?
Well, he knows how to. He doesn't know when too, he says he doesn't see a need for it
lol
Doesn't see a need for it.
Nice
$mstmt = $conn->prepare('UPDATE messages SET replied="true" WHERE id=' . $_GET['id']);
WHY IS HE DOING THAT
HE IS CORRECTLY BINDING THE VALUES JUST A FEW LINES ABOVE
Link to the code?
I think you can just do id=1 AND 1=2 to see if it is vulnerable
https://github.com/JacobMisirian/TelBoard/blob/master/TelBoard/do-reply.php
He has two tables, right?
So.. id=1 AND 1=2 UNION SELECT 1,column_name FROM information_schema.columns LIMIT 1,1--
Is replied a string value?
If so he should be using a tinyint with 1 and 0...
Obviously yes
lol
Aviv, tinyint(1) is deprecated
Know your SQL!
Not to my knowledge
He uses strings for bools
"true"
wut
Aviv, BIT(1) is the new hotness
It doesn't look like it on the MySQL manual
but yeah fine splitty___
I use tinyint, but...
yeah lol
There's nothing wrong with using tinyint(1)
I'll use bit from now on
But I am pretty sure that BIT(1) is the preferred way to do it
well
if you want more then 0 or 1
then use tinyint
OMG OMG OMG OH NO
than**********8
not then
than is for comparisons!!!!
$rquery = 'SELECT nickname, message FROM replies WHERE id=' . $id;
another one...
lol
The one with $_GET is the best though
Oh this one uses that too
oh haha
so splitty___, what are you going to do with this?
Wait..
Nevermind
Poor raerae
I wonder what he'll end up doing
$query = 'SELECT username FROM users WHERE username="' . $_GET['user'] . '"';This one
Maybe he'll get a job in TTK's palace
1'); DROP TABLE users;
xDD
It's hard to get any useful information from tel..
that do-reply-php is reloading too fast
[20:27] <Viperidae> He uses strings for bools [20:28] <Viperidae> "true" [20:28] <Viperidae> wut >> are you serious ?
yep
https://github.com/JacobMisirian/TelBoard/blob/master/TelBoard/do-reply.php
Line 31
woo!
... why, is there like no bool in php?
there is
lol
There is no bool in mysql.
but that doesn't mean use a string...
And he doesn't seem to know that booleans are just integers.
^
Aviv, you could restructure his database to use BIT(1) LOL
I'd rather not help RaeRae
But yeah I could
like really sadly I could...
xD
I'll listen to some great german rap now, while writing the ascss compiler.
Because I'm bored. xD
lol

Not really xD

That CSS kernel thing is just weird :D
I want to create subdomain but I dont know how to in wordpress
ignore ^
lel
Nullz: https://gist.github.com/SplittyDev/4338030e7fbd8b9f3ac2
Updated it. This is a kernel loader, written in valid CSS. xD
NIce
So my area has GIGABIT INTERNET now(comcast, I was talking about it earlier figured out its already here)
>> Can't get it
>> To expensive
lel
hi bacon Emily Nullz splitty___
Hello
Hey
Ichiru, I'm doing something crazy
https://gist.github.com/SplittyDev/4338030e7fbd8b9f3ac2
splitty
css isn't turing complete
Viperidae said that CSS is turing complete
lel
it isn't though
Hmm. I doesn't really matter. llcss-as creates AT&T or NASM x86 code (can be set by --style=att or --style=nasm) from the css.
That code gets assembled by gnu-as or nasm
that's weird
Aviv had that crazy idea of writing a kernel in css and I think it's a funny idea
I will be the first person on this planet to write a working Hello, World! kernel in valid CSS
"valid" as in "only uses valid css syntax", not as in "passes the jigsaw validator" :D
It would probably work to just replace syntax elements using regex
But I'm gonna write a scanner and parser
you're strange
I know, right
:P
Hey ThePhoneKeeper
I'm reading logs, afk
k
Have fun
Yesturday I learned C now I'm learning C++
Well not really learned I pretty much just understand it now xD
Gonna be afk for awhile
Sup bitches?
I'm sorry. You're not all bitches
Only a few, won't name any
lol
Nullz: That switch statement is not healthy
It's fixed :D
Good.
Ichiru, are you here/
?*
So um in C++
#include <iostream> using namespace std; whats the difference? Is the using namespace doing C++ things and hte include doing C libraries?
Nullz: Nope
Btw, don't do the using namespace thing. It's bad practicwe
practice*
Whenever you do something like cout, right? That's coming from iostream, a C library and it's in the std namespace. Normally, you call it as std::cout, but because you have that using namespace std, you don't have to put the std namespace before
But it's still a bad practice to do using namespace things
I dont understand how thats bad practice xD
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1452721/why-is-using-namespace-std-considered-bad-practice
ah alright
I managed to update my font renderer
To work properly
Ichiru: Awesome
I want to rewrite my file format
Make it way better
And modular
I like C++ so far and I can already do what that C course teached me in C++
Pretty much the same thing but the C++ course went over it already
Only thing I dont understand is what do I gotta use << in printing to the console?
Nullz, you can also use printf
Oh lol thanks
You can use everything from C
Nullz: cout and cin are from iostream, printf and such are from stdio
I didn't include stdio though?
And it works?
.
NickServ<	identify ****
yep
These are my includes: #include <iostream> #include <cassert> #include "foo.h";
#include <cstdio>
if you want to use printf
#include <iostream> is std::cout
It already works
if you want to use newer C++ features
It'll get stricter
and force you to include it :P
I'm using printf without stdio xD
Visual studio might automatically include it
Ichiru, splitty_: Is MD5 good for a file checksum?
ye
for file verification
Good
Is it weird if I include the checksum at the beginning of the file?
Checksum for the content
nah
that's pretty usual
I also totally forgot to enable blending, and wondered why my transparent things weren't working __-
I can't remember which blendfunc i'm supposed to use
I'll tell you in a bit
figured it out from the docs
Good
So in total
My GL wrapper is 237 lines including debug code
Awesome.
turns out you can add hooks to any delegate
I can't inherit IDisposable and EventArgs :/
Am I the only one who doesn't have anything that implements IDispozable?
disposabe*
disposable*
fuc
fuck*
I HATE THIS!
I need to play something
Maybe. I think its important for optimization,.
Turns out I dont even need it on this class because it only has ints and you can't null ints!
you only need to dispose things
that need disposing
like file handles
and graphics resources
Or smelly vaginas
cuz they think af
hence the word smelly
"they think af"
I'm done the night, gnight
I'm gonna go to sleep
Goodnight :P

https://youtu.be/vt_7DiG1-r8?t=47 :/
base 64 is a number system though...
If it would celebrate a number system they would do Base 10 > Base 64 anyways
base 16 all the way....
I only know how to read base 10
Which everyone knows how to xD
I can read base 16 easily, and binary too (Although I'd have to think it through in my head alot more)
I'm liking C++ :D

They are fucking hot.
Too much chili
Nullz: I occasionally play single player, but when I do I usually get into it
What game?
Minecraft
For some reason I'm very sick of that game
I haven't opened it in a good while
That's why I only play it like once or twice a year
Yup
I had 4 years of playing it daily, then I simply got sick of being bored in a world of cubes
I used to do like team death match and stuff in it, but that's broken atm and I need my aussie buddies
For some reason, because I now know how neural networks work, I want to make one in C#
But I'm also forced to make a website for my school class
And work on my game engine
I'm basically fucked
I don't feel like doing anything
back
do the website first
websites for schools have shockingly low requirements
Why are you "forced" to make a website for school?
I don't work for free
You shouldn't either
Viperidae: If I don't write it, I won't pass a class
So yeah
That doesn't make any sense...
You're not in a webdevelopment class
Ask my head teacher
She's the bitch
How can she give you an entirely different assignment than the rest of the class?
Because the rest of the class doesn't have any
And I'm not doing the normal classes while I'm home schooled
I do a reduced set of things

Sarahi Nieves 5 hours ago
+TheMagesticWaffle1 Come back to me when you hit Assembly and C to program Microcontrollers - No Alduino and no scripts.
That said, there are tools nowadays that help programmers and designers alike. For games, you have engines such as Unity and even Unreal Engine 4 - free now and... oh so nice. PHP is easier than HTML, and you are able to use a MySQL database instead of forcing yourself on asp.net. There are a variety of IDEs and engines that makes things you had to do before, look ridiculously easy. An example is C++ and C# (or java), with its nightmarish
pointers vs C#'s ArrayList.
Nullz, did my thing go through?
Or did the flood trigger kill me before?
yah
it went through
The _TheMagesticwaffle1?
Who cares about the name
Now, you see how much wrong there is in that comment?
pointers vs C#'s ArrayList. is the last thin you said
and it actually did kick you at that point sorry
And so much more... Easy to use engines: Construct2, Stencil, Kodu. Etc etc etc...
The generation before us wasn't that lucky, programming on IDEs that looked closer to Notepad... or were Notepad... And yet, they are the ones responsible for the awesome tools we can enjoy today
That's the rest
I dont see where its wrong?
Everywhere
Hes pretty much just pointing out that i'ts easier now then it was then
First of all, you can use C to program the Arduino
And there's no such thing asn an Alduino
>> Dont even know what arduino is
A little board you program, it has input and output pins so you can connect LEDs, motors and such
PHP is easier than HTML, and you are able to use a MySQL database instead of forcing yourself on asp.net.
This
PHP is never easier than HTML
Nor do you have to force yourself to use ASP.NET if you don't want PHP
There are other alternatives, Ruby, Python, a static page, so on and so forth
Also, PHP is not MySQL only. It can work with any database if you know how to set it up
Also, there was no generation to program in notepad. Ever.
There were IDEs even since the first c64
And Atari computers
Alright so everywhere he was wrong, are things I havent touched or learned anything about xD
Okay, nor IDEs
Code editors
Tools to make your life easier when you program
Woo
Woo what?
Woo tools that make your life easier when you program
TheBrokenKeeper: I wouldn't call Kodu an engine
Neither would I
But as you can see, that guy's an idiot
Thinking he's the best on the planet
LOL kodu is like a sandbox for children.
Oh wait
He said that
Yes
Not me
Is this on a Youtube video?
Yup
Link?
Trying to get to it. Shitty internet is shitty
Viperidae: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44
I'm sure your internet is 1000x better than anything anyone else here has...
The shitstorm troopers have arrived.
100-125mbps down 12 up. Wbu you ttk?
lol it looks like some bad version of scratch
Nullz: Way less
Because I'm on Wifi
Holy shit Nullz that's fast as shit
On wired, my shitty laptop limits my speed to 150 down, 130 up
But on my PC I usually have 500 down 150 up
TheBrokenKeeper: That is fast as fuck
I'm on wired
I'm sorry, but if you think 150 mbps is slow you are a spoiled fucking panzy
^
The majority of the fucking world has somewhere around 30 mbps
I currently have 43...
That's two times faster than my speed
10 times faster than Augments
Nullz: http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/4440832995
PS TheBrokenKeeper: I gave up on downloading Korora
When not on wired its like 50-80 depending on the device(other than the expection of my phone and only my phone with 20) and every device gets 11-12 up
Because internet speeds
Great
That's shitty G wireless
As my laptop doesn't know N wireless
Shitty?
Yes
Dual shitty core with 3GB of RAM
I call that shitty
Don't you?
I have like 25 Mbps
There is NOTHING more irritating than hearing someone complain about 40 MBPS.
Viperidae, can you fucking stop the abuse?
I used to only get 0.5mpbs for a whole fucking year
There are so many people I know who'd appreciate 40 MBPS
I was talking about this
06:17 <Viperidae> Shitty?
06:18 <TheBrokenKeeper> Yes
06:18 <TheBrokenKeeper> Dual shitty core with 3GB of RAM
06:18 <TheBrokenKeeper> I call that shitty
Lol
Viperidae, I was talking about my specs
Not speed
For fuck sake STOP THE KILL ABUSE
I don't kill you because I don't have a reason, nor should you kill me for no reason
Okay?
You were talking about your wifi standards (You said it doesn't support 802.11g)
That was channel flood
I said it supports G
But not N
And I consider that to be a shitty laptop
As even my fucking 2008 phone knows N wifi connection
There are people in Africa who would love to have that laptop
Oh for fuck sake cut the crap
I would love to have that laptop for linux
6
*^
Think about all the poor children in need
I really want to kill you now, but I have some respect
http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/4440840964 A little bit slower than USUAL but there you go
Viperidae: By your own laws, shouldn't you kill Nullz?
As you said that speeds over 40 MB are forbidden
A long time ago
Uhm, no
But rules still apply, right?
I'm not complaining
What I said was complaining about speeds over 40 MB was forbidden xD
I was complaining about my laptop specs not my fucking internet speed
I'm saying its slower than usual :p
You don't know how to pay attention at what you read Viperidae
And I said that because it's annoying as fuck to see people complain about such high speeds, when half the world doesn't have speeds that fast
I WAS FUCKING COMPLAINING ABOUT LAPTOP SPECS
4 years ago I would of loved to have your laptop
I got it in 2010
It was a completely reasonable assumption that you were implying that your speed is reduced because it does not support the latest wifi standards.
Well, yes, it is
But you seem to be in a pissy mood today....
It's 6:25 AM
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzpndHtdl9A
I've been up since 4:30
In Mother Russia, you make words, not words make you.
Btw, I intended bad grammar, from now on I will specify everything. I don't want a kill again
I remember when 10mbps were godly << inb4 you guys are like back in 90's we had kb internet
What happens when your killed
I get disconnected
./kill nullz
I had dial-up internet when I was small
That doesn't work
./destroy nullz
Would you like me to kill you?
yes
oh
How was it?
weird
It went to the status screen
and was like
TheBrokenKeeper are you interested in a CLion keygen?
spdoiugwergkxcljgnhpjdsilgnsfknasdmf you got killed oa;phgfnjkahfusaifjalkf int0x10 base 2 100101010101
splitty__: I already have one
lol where did you get it from?
See TheBrokenKeeper: You can kill people who are lesser than you too.
And you also need to patch CLion to be able to generate a key
Viperidae, I can kill you too...
Yeah but patching it is easy
Yeah, but I can nullroute you; so I'm still on top
I can also nullroute you too
I just have to wait a few hours
No you can't xD
Aurora can
splitty__: https://github.com/rover12421/JetbrainsPatchKeygen
Oh yeah, he has root access
See?
I can tell him how you were bad and mean to all of us
Give him some fake logs
But he does not have solusVM access.
Well
Or VNC access
Don't know then
When Reagan comes back I'll be able to do it
lol, Reagan doesn't have root
I know
But he can give you a program
I write a rootkit
Get access to your whole PC
You know, things like that?
But...
I have root access to the Vulcan botnet
DDoS time
I know... And it's scary
Ha, he only has like 7 people infected I think though
Poor him XD
Infect the world!
That's enough to down a MyBB forum!
Awesome!
I had a dream last night where I fucked my friends mom
That... doesn't really sound healthy
Mums are not thigns to fuck with
Viperidae, TheBrokenKeeper
shes hot and single though
I wonder if it would be illegal to put my MBAM keygen on github
I had a dream where I fucked a furry
Don't know splitty
Nullz: Does she have a facebook profile?
Technically it's just a algorithm that creates keys.
I'll get a picture
XD
The use should be illegal, but just open sourcing it should not.
Theres one and she doesnt look hot in it <<
I had a dream I got raped by a dog
Interesting.
Rowan and Sabrina were also there, but there in all of my dreams
Am I the only person with realistic goals?
Like... Viperidae's bestiality and Nullz's stars... Those are kinda hard goals
what?
Nullz: You have a crush on stars
Yes but I know it'll never happen
I have a crush on a slut, still :(
Interesting
I'll be sleeping now
Night viper
And I also have a crush on Taylor swift, Debby Ryan, and Peyton List
One day they'll all take turns sucking my dick
Good night [Idle]Viperae

TheBrokenKeeper, I made a really nice asian noodle soup :D

Hello people of this chat.
Hello bacon of this chat.
I want a subway sandwich so bad right now
The closest subway to me is 120 km away from me
I know know how big km is :/
A mile is 1.6 km
One sec
no thanks
I got it
74.56 miles
105
nvm
lol I typed in 170 not 120
Interesting
Thats a while an I feel bad for you
Mine is 1.5 miles xD
Cool
Mine is I don't know miles.
I just checked
0.559 miles and
another at 0.497 miles
I don't get why America uses miles, why don't all countries use the metric system
And celsius instead of farenheit
Indeed, km is better.
A meter is just more logical
0.8km and 0.9km
There's no point getting into a war of measurement systems though, there's nothing we can do.
or is there...
We can kill everyone not using the metric system!
This day marks the beginning of a segregation between the imperialists and the metrics.
The revolution begins now.
ON MY MARKS
READY>
FIRE.
I'd kill two people, but they'll hate me afterwards
XD
TheBrokenKeeper
Did you read my pm?
Yes
k
I'm too lazy to check it out right now
k
It works pretty well
Nice
Here is a screenshot of my event log:
http://puu.sh/itmbU/b102a8fa46.png
http://puu.sh/itmcp/d8cb0fd6b5.png
I wish I was taught the metric system. I also wish the USA wasn't a pile of dog shit too. All things I can't change though. I'll probably be marked as a terrorist in the NSA just for saying this too.
Nullz: The NSA can't see this IRC server
Well yes maybe not  but who can say there isn't a keylogger planted into my harddrive
Or when I plugged one of my usbs in it infected it
Keyloggers are not planted by the NSA
You sure? :D
Okay, the point I'm trying to make is there is much more ways that just grabbing the information from the IRC
Okay
The NSA can probably read everything here.
Are they connected?
They don't need to be connected
If not, this IRC is mostly using SSL
Do you really think that SSL is a problem for the NSA?
No
But they don't bother with small IRC networks
How do you know this?
Theres no way to know for sure.
Well fuck the NSA
Yes fuck the NSA but I can't do anything about it
Hey, NSA, if you see this, you can go fuck yourself. Get each and every one of the employees and give each one of them buttplugs to insert. Also, gangbang eachother. So yeah, the NSA can go die in a pit.
Education here sucks, People here suck, The decisions here suck etc etc etc. NSA if your reading this I'm not a terrorist and I never want to harm the NSA, I just dont agree with almost anything the USA does with education and "freedom"
NSA if you read this, I am a terrorist and I want to harm the NSA because #freedom
Guns don't kill people. Splitty does.
Too much?
No? Good.
I wonder if feminists averagely believe in god because if so we could use it as a argument.
For what?
Well most modern day feminists say all men are bad, but if they believe in god, we could use jesus as the argument.
anyways going to sleep, night.
That's more misandry than feminism
Just sayin
There grouped more nicks
Soo... What's the topic of the current discussion?
Whatever, I like true feminism but most pop culture feminists are like that. Feel free to prove me wrong tomorrow but thats what my research about this whole movement for the past 2 days have been like. night
Augment, do you webdev?
AndroUser2, do you webdev?
You know, androirc users should set fallback nicks
Splitty__, you here?
Yes
Your Descant theme lacks shadows
whut
Material design has soft shadows sometimes
There are shadows everywhere. :D
I can't see any
http://puu.sh/itot5/f8e3145ad6.png
http://puu.sh/itotn/dc6096ab93.png
http://puu.sh/itotG/ed711d765b.png
Are you sure that you are talking about my theme? :D
Okay...
http://descant.splitty.de/index.html#/topics
That
I am still working on it. I need to figure out something nice for the topic list
And some stuff isn't working as it should
Ah, okay
It will probably be in descant v0.2 or descant v0.3
Am I the only person who can't do web design?
It'll take a few weeks to finish it.
I am not good at web design.
I am just doing it because I want a simple flat/material design. :D
I currently have 3 different people making a website each for my class
Nikxda, Aurora and Aviv
loool
Which means that 2/3 of the total work on that website is completely redundant
I'll chose the best one :D
Yup
Did you tell them that other people are working on the same thing?
I'm working on one too
Yup
k
Everybody but him is working on his site. Mkay.
^^
[13:48] (ThePhoneKeeper) I'm working on one too
I am pretty sure that Nikxda will make the best one
He's a really experienced web designer
I'll let the head teacher decide which one to use in the end. Hopefully nikxda does the best job
We are working perfectly together. I do the backend programming, he does the frontend stuff. :D
Nice
Did any of you buy obsidian.ninja?
Yes
And we bought https://obsidians.io
Which one did it?
We're still working on the public API.
did what?
Whick one of you bought it?
Nikxda bought them using my credentials :D
Nikxda says he doesn't have .ninja in his namecheap list
Afk
oh. Maybe he didn't buy .ninja. I'm not completely sure if he did.
Back
.ninja domains seem to be $15 US a year
Splitty__, timestud.io is $33
Wow...
lol

"Hey you fucking whore"
100% chance you're gonna get laid
Yeah... sure...
jk, pretty sure that account is a bot.
I wouldn't talk like that if I wouldn't be sure
Yup
But still, that collection of photos is nice
Yeah :D
Skype or what?
I guess that's the new way of trying to convince people to register on a "100% free" site with your credit card

Yeah Skype
Interesting
I'm still wondering if it's possible for one to become fluent in Japanese via self teaching
I'm getting messages from bots at least once a month
And no, it isn't.
At least understand a bit?
I tried it. xD
Did you manage to get anywhere with it?
Well, just the basic stuff.
Define "basic stuff"
Japanese is not hard. You can learn the words and the pronounciation. The problem is that you can't teach yourself the syntax and stuff like that.
Well I can thank people for food and I can order beer.
And ask them for their names and stuff
Really basic
Interesting
Also, Katakana and Hiragana is confusing. xD
Also, is it possible for one to write japanese with Windows? Like Hiragana Katakana and Kanji combined?
Because afaik, you can only cohose one of them
You'd write Romanji
You have to be crazy for that
Romaji*
Like, really
Not really
No sane person uses Romaji for japanese
Katakana is mostly used for loan words, but you can use it for other purposes
Hiragana is for japanese words when they're not written in kanji
And Hiragana is also used for the syntax. Stuff like conjugations
Katakana and Hiragana == Kana
ã?ã?ã?ã?ã?®ã?ªã?¾ã?ã?ãã?¥ãã?ã?§ã?ã
In Kana, each character is a syllable
That's as far as I went with japanesew
japanese*
hmm
It's weird that they have so many systems..
Kanji is weird, but the idea behind it is nice.
In Kanji, each character stands for an idea or a concept
Not really. Hiragana is for native words, Katakana for foreign words and Kanji for native words that are too overused
Not really.
æ°´ = water
That's Kanji.
Yes
It would be way more characters with Kana
Man, Kanji looks weird
Yeah, I agree. :D
I find Romaji easier to learn
But Ichiru knows how to write it for Chinese
I just can't wrap my head around Kana
Hey, Ichiru, get your ass back here
Hi
And Kanji is even harder
Someone said Chinese?
I was doing Chinese stuff today!
I did
Show splitty your Chinese writing powerd
powers*
Well, Chinese is very different from Japanese
splitty__: Kana is easy XD
TheBrokenKeeper I can't remember the symbols.. xD
Romaji is easy and makes sense (kinda)
I forgot 80% of them because I didn't exercise in a long time
I used memrise to learn that stuff

Just for fun.

Yeah Ichiru, Memrise
i use that for chinese :P
It's awesome :D
Really helpful.
I've got 12 courses going :P
i must speak to Viperidae
Viperidae speaking
do you want to come to the beach with me at 12
(free food)
When would I be back? I kind of have shit to do today; grandparents are coming over and my mom wants me to clean up some shit
idk 2 or 3
Viperidae I made a Vulcan removal tool
Is it okay that it's on GitHub? I can remove it if you want
I made it for TheBrokenKeeper
Hmmmm, sure I'll just get this shit out of the way first Castiel. Also, splitty_ that's fine
Okay thank you
ok cool fam
Splitty_ have you tested it?
bring board shorts
Ah ok
Splitty_: If you want to test it, http://misiriansoft.com/mlg.exe
Viperidae I tested it with a dummy file. Vulcan doesn't restart itself after being terminated afaik
It runs as a service and checks for an infection every hour. If it finds Vulcan, it will get the process id, kill it and remove the executable and the folder.
It checks the working directory, so it doesn't accidentally kill the real wininit.exe
Ha, noice!
Wow Jacob's vulcan isn't obfuscated.
https://github.com/SplittyDev/Devulcanizer/blob/master/Devulcanizer/Service.cs
i think i need the vulcan tool just in case
Vulcanizer is running 24/7 on my system. An infection will last 59 minutes in the worst case.
Devulcanizer*
Vulcanizer would also be a fun tool
haha yeah
It infects your system every hour XD
But who would install a service like that :D
Some of Jacob's friends don't give a shit that Vulcan is on their system
Well, you could go to a friend, install it when he's not looking
Boom!
Hahaha Viperidae you know what's funny?
Like, this one guy knows that we can look at his screen when ever we want too; and he isn't even phased by it
What?
The name of that service would be Vaas. Vulcan as a Service.
lulz
You should create a module called Montenegro
Let's infect people with Vaas Montenegro.
Hey we are not going to be able to make moblie ICPWN on the windows phone becasue it wont dev unlock without a working SIM card
srry m8
Anosim.
http://www.secretgsm.com/
splitty__: Those prices are fucking expensive xD
BTW Viperidae im going to be at your house at 11:00 or so
be fucking read
y
You can get 100+ anonymous sim cards for just a few bucks on the darknet
nice
But it costs too much for calls and texts
also my car broke agian
im bring my truck
TheBrokenKeeper anonymous sim cards are not made for calls and texts. xD
You sure?
Well the secretgsm ones are.
They seem to work
Sure, it works.
The darknet ones should only be used for a single call or a single text message.
Why is that?
yeah but the problem is splitty__  that idk where you live and youre probably gonna have to mail them to me or Viperidae
They're often used by drug dealers and stuff
Great...
Castiel_, that's what pack stations are for. :P
Viperidae: "Avril Laphone"
idk what those are
:P
I don't know how to say it in english. xD
PO box?
YES
ok
Pretty sure that's what I meant
like describe it
Post boxes with a key
OH o
i know what you mean
but i dont have one
You can get one easily
but
that costs money
Yeah but not that much :D
and car parts are too important
:P
lol sorry went AFK
You can't really go to jail for buying anonymous sim cards
AVRIL LAPHONE
How is Avril Laphone going xD
like shit
Should I ask what Avril Laphone is? Not sure.. xD
the windows phone we are planning on using for moblie ICPWN
haha nice
the lock screen is of Aviril Livine
I gave him my old shitty Windows phone, and we plan on using it for a mobile version of IcPwn
the singer
You should just use Android and port ICPWN to Xamarin Android.
You could keep it in C# and you'd only have to change a few things
thats problably what is gonna happen b/c on the dev lock
Yeah, I've thought about that but doesn't Xarmin cost money?
*Xaramin
Nope
You only need to buy a license if you want to sell your stuff, I think
And I believe Xamarin.iOS costs something
Oh, cool beans then
ok
But I've written Android apps in C# and it worked fine
You can debug your app directly on your phone using adb magic
can we intall it on the windows phone and remove winblows 8?
wut
Hi
Does Windows Phone have ARM processors?
Hey
Yeah it does
Should be possible then.
ok
splitty__ here, that's something new
:D
Yep
It's stylish.
__ is the new black
ok i gotta get ready, Viperidae  ill be at your place at 11 or so
Have fun :D
Alrighty
my mom is going to kill me, I'm supposed to like clean the house today and shit
Where do you live?
haha
A little more pecise?

No actually I'm just going there
I'll be joining the great November revolution
Well
Okay
Remember, remember the 5th of november :D
Oh dear
don't bomb parliament.
He wont
He'll hack it
I would bomb the white house but I am pretty sure that it's easier to bomb the parliament.
ANARCHY
I can't get rid of america, so I'll just get rid of the united kingdom
jk
That doesn't even make sense
Splitty_: You're now on a list
I don't care
I love it
There will be a march with a good amount of anonymous members
And I think that it'll be fun
Let's see if they let me in. :P
I don't know wtf to do with my North Korea flag
My north korea flag is still in my room. It's awesome
LOL
I want to like, put it on a car and drive around with it
xDDD
Castiel would love that idea.
Glue it to his car
He will love you forever
Make sure to use some super destructive glue :D
Apparently, his car is broken so he has a pick up trick
*truck
LOL
That's even better

Well, these board shorts are too fucking short :|
I look like a faggot

Goodnight
Good night :D
Fuck.
My sister put shampoo on the toilet. Wtf is wrong with her
I misread that as you fucked your sister (Don't ask how I got that out of that, I guess I just saw 'fuck' and 'sister' and put two together)
Your sister is creepy anyway
Remember when I was at yours and she just came to the party asking for someone to play table tennis with her?
And then just picked me out and got me to actually play table tennis with her
Like
wtf
Is that what they call it now a days?
"Table Tennis"
I'd love to play!
Well
I was 13
Oh, well then.
I wish I had a hot sister I could fuck around with on the weekends
take mine she's a bitch
but consent age is also one
:DD
totes
she's 14
oh
well then, I'm 3 years older
Acceptable
i have another that's 16 soon but not THAT hot
Acceptable
and a 23 year old brother
Acceptable
;)

Any namecheap hosting in here?
Namecheap is love
Namecheap is life
Namecheap sucks

Yeah
I cannot get python to work
Help me
http://exp.nikx.io/blog/backend/test2.py

Don't know
It just displays it.
No fucking idea why
Umn... That is creepy
ikr
So... You'd fuck a spider?
Or a strain of ebola?
Well, spiders don't really have the right equipment.
A robibot dog?
Robot*
Tape a fleshlight to it
And sure
And then get stuck, I can already imagine
You are weird
totally
I don't care
I love it
Aviv, have you tried to work on that?
A fleshlight + robot dog?
That would redefine "doggy style"
Great...
You are one weird fucker
Speaking of doggy style, if you haven't tried it; do it. It is life changing
Nikxda, just get Django already
Namecheap -> not supporting Django
Checked yesterday
wut
Namecheap does not support Django
Is that more clear?
Then it won't support normal python either
It is
Python 2.6 is installed
How could a DNS registrar not support django?
I don't own a VPS
Viperidae, namecheap also offers web hosting
Oh, you use their hosting?
Actually, I do, but not on namecheap
Yes, I'm using shared
Oh, I see
Openshift supports django, and that's free
Viperidae, would your VPS support a Django server next to whatever is on it?
Probably.
Intetesting
"Intetesting"
What are some good free domain things? That would hide an openshift thing?
Dot ga, dot tk, but I don't think .rhcloud.com is that bad...
I need it for my class
So? And that means you can't use rhcloud?
My teacher might not like it. Also, I need a name for it
If she doesn't like it, then tell her to buy you a domain name
Interesting
Well, she won't do it for sure
Then it's her fault
ThePhoneKeeper what is wrong with fucking a robot dog
^
Everything
Can't say that until you've tried it though
Not really
Exactly
Just the concept of fucking a non-human being is not right
Robot dogs don't have feeling. It's okay to use them to please yourself xD
It's the same for robot women and sex dolls
Inanimate objects can be fucked, no exceptions.
Well, if a robot woman has feelings and thinks, what about that?
Is it rape if I program her to say yes?
It would be a program, even if it was an advanced AI. You can safely ignore her saying no.
Well, your mind is a program too...
nikxda: Photos or didn't happen
huh?
You and splitty's sister
Maybe he has some
And I meant that literally
We played table tennis
As said, I was 13
:D
I know
But, well, in spain, consent age is 13, you know?
Here, afaik it's 14 :P
German people are crazy, let's assume 32 years old
Lol Wut
14 here.
Awesome
But you have to ask your parents xDDDDD
16 without permission xD
Interesting
"mom, can I fuck my bf? He's only 5 years older than me and our love is real"
I think that mum would call the cops right away
Nope, this is Germany. xD
That mum would be like
Go kid do your thing
Interesting
Your mom might be like that
But fucking use condoms or I'm gonna gas you
gas...
There's nothing inherently wrong about killing people with gas, you know?
Uhm
Hey Aviv!
hi splitty
I should sleep. xD
Irony is when a nazi dies in a right-hand bend after stepping on the gas too hard
No idea if it makes sense in English
My humor is so black, it stole my bike.
Nope
Some badass over here
Nope
slackroad is here!
Hooray
woo
Is anyone here das MÃ¤dchen mit den ZauberkrÃ¤ften?
Aviv, no.
Hmm let's see if splitty is
Splitty, are you das MÃ¤dchen mit den ZauberkrÃ¤ften?
Soo... is it free for the rest of the world?
Like, add the rest of the currencies
Yeah
Free for everyone else
Awesome!
ok
silly Canadians
Now, what other features should be included in Descant v0.2
Apart from translations, which is done
Theming
Porn is a must, look at the phone industry now.
I guess bacon is right
hi aggu'
Oh yeah, I remember what I was going to add
Notifications
!
5 points for griffindore.
remove the e
make the first i a y
Now, there are two options for doing this.
Option A, or 1: Use django-notifications
Option B/2: Just create my own Notification model
Hmm
there is one more option
3, use bacon-notifications
Option C/3: Carrier Pigeon
Aurora01. You will need Korean translations
Find me a Korean translator then
North Korea will blow us all if you don't add them
Plus there are a few Romanian keys that need adding
...
ã ë¬´ë­
ã?ã?ã±ã·ã?
See? I know my Korean
Translate it then
:P
Well, at least I know how to write banana and korea. And also read Hangul(the alphabet)
I kinda know more Japanese, but still
Aurora, did you write this e-mail?:
"It is unfortunate that you have not read the building report provided to you since you are about to incur substantial costs that will dwarf the disappointment you feel about the light switch in the bathroom"
Context:
Lady had company pre-inspect a house before purchasing.
Light switch in bathroom didn't work, did say it worked in the report.
She complained.
Got this email.
Aurora01: ç¬¬ä¸é?¸æï¼ï¾ï¾ï½¼ï¾ï½¬ï¾?ï½ºï¾éç¥
That means: First choice: django notifications
xD
Aviv, also, could you figure out a way to show statistics on the frontend?
Like a layout or something
totally
It's been available since v0.1 but I forgot about it
xD
The current available statistics are:
Most replies to a topic
Average amount of posts per user
Topic count
Post count
User with the most posts
Average amount of replies to topics
Descant apparently has 23.5kloc
1000 lines worth of directives
600 lines of templates
"When I go into âCreate New Accountâ on your signup page, it says it is mandatory for me to fill in my password. Obviously there is no way I am going to give out my password. This canât be right!"
Who said that?

i know
i registered
"My computer wonât turn onâ¦ Can you remote in and take a look?"
Aurora01: bootswatch theme looks nice
But not as nice as the default? ;)
Aviv's default theme is amazing
yay
The Bootswatch one was just made by me quickly to test the theming system
oh god I still need to fix that UCP
You can change the overall page layout in templates/default/pages/user-cp.html
slackroad, you speak Russian right?
yep
Could you do a Russian translation of Descant then?
no
i don't know that much
i'm not like a russian american
Well, anything's good.
then get someone better than me
i can't really speak russian
I don't know anyone else who speaks Russian.
i can read and fluently listen to russian
PIRATE XD
Are you at a level where you could Google Translate stuff and just fix the errors that Google makes?
THAT's SERIOUSLY A LANGUAGE
not really
google translate is just flawless in russian
Well, just google translate the stuff then :P
My mom speaks Russian
lol
all of my parents do
my brother is really good too
get them to do it then ;)
but he's in boston
Call him ;)
literally, almost all of my relatives speak russian amazingly
then you better learn too!
Anyway, slackroad, any feedback or feature suggestions?
yes
oh?
it's perty
I'm glad you like that :P
I'll create a three word story there, slackroad.
is there reputation?
wait
why can't i make a thread?
slackroad, not yet
Did you activate your email?
i think?
i click the link and the screen is empty
Hold on then
I'll manually activate you
Done
You should be able to post now
does it use gravatar?
Yeah
once upon a large fat elephant
xD
does that make sense?
Not really
Hmm, it seems that the activation link doesn't work properly

It's a multi-line text area
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
don't make it
You mean you want it to only support one line?
no
make it so i can press enter duh
that's kind of stupid
How could you have new lines then?
i can't have new lines!
THAT'S THE PROBLEM
brb
gotta eat mac
and
chezz
OH
You mean that it isn't working
I need to know what browser you're using then.
slackroad, thanks for pointing out the activate bug too
shift enter to send?
So excited for Descant home premium
Shift+Enter would be useful
?
back
slackroad: did you mean that you couldn't add new lines in the text area?
no i can
but when i did they didn't show up in the finished text
like if i put in "hello (pressed enter) then put in hi" then saved it, it wouldn'
t show the enter
it would just be hellohi
brb
That's a 'feature' of Markdown.
You need two new lines to actually show a new line.
fuck
:/
However, you do get cool things like quoting and lists by default in Descant.
Hey cammy
HEY PERSON
it's me slackroad..

Hello, Cameron.
:/
HELLO AURORA
I am annoyed
why is that?
I spent Â£70 buying Danger Days: California 2019 Edition, and it was missing both the damn CDs
How the hell did they just FORGET the CDs? The bloody thing was sealed!
LOL
Fuckin' factories in China fucking up
don't insult 10,000 chinese people who get payed 3 cents an hour!
probably more than 10k
My employees would certainly get 3 cents an hour if they're incapable of putting a CD in a damn box
Surely you can just get a refund/a box containing a disk?
I'll go. CS:GO.
I'm not getting a refund or returning it bc everything else was in the box
I've asked them to send me the CDs separately, if they can't I'll probably be offered a partial refund
They fucking better be able to send the CDs though because one of them is incredibly rare
Fuckin' Warner Brothers
totally
Cameron: are you still working on OSNNxt?
OSNNxt?

xD
computercam is yourmom
yes true
Shit I was supposed to clean my room and instead I was at some random party on a navy base with Castiel xD
Was it awesome?
I have a sudden urge to rearrange my stuff and room and life
My guitar picks has arrived and came with a holder so all is okay again >.< no more accidentally throwing them away...
Well TBK
Courtney's father was most likely some where there
Instead, you just throw away the guitar, Cameron.
Thankfully, I didn't see him
Interesting
We just dicked around and got our selves in this very intense vollyball match (/me can't sport)
"Hmm, what is this funny looking box? I don't need this."
Recycling worker then "borrows" and sels the guitar.
*sells
Why does Splitty sleep during the day and stay awake during the night?
Well

nope lol
watch it
k
xDD
wtf
for loops in python are weird as fuck
^
It's almost like doing foreach(int i in new int[count]) (Not exactly though)
hi vippy
lol Nullz is that legitimate descant prices?
I dont know I expect you would kow
I doubt it
I do know
because $59.99 != 999.99 ca
lol the prices were meant to be different
btw it is free everywhere else
lol
You should sell it
well a premium version
haha not with Viperidae here
hes against it but I dont think he would actually stop you.
Oh he would
Viperidae
would you?
stop him?
He would
totally
rightvippy?
I'm selling my Engine
which will be open sourced after I drop the project
but thats not public
Io sono Stella?
Viperidae I can't import my python class lol
splitty_ is also gonna be selling obsidian xD its not but to sell your software
You may not!
Software is free as in free speech (not free bears)
Hes gonna sell some sort of prackage or some way to make money off of it.
Nuove fate siamo
THEBROKENKEEPER
GET YOUR ASS HERE
I have two python files, mbam-utils.py and mbam-utils-core.py
How the fuck do I import mbam-utils-core.py from mbam-utils.py
import MbamUtilsCore, import mbam-utlils-core, nothing works.
import MbamUtilsCore from mbam-utils-core
import mbam-utils-core
I don't think you are supposed to name files like that
I'm no python programmer though
nopw
npoe
nope
You can program anything Viperidae
even splitty_.com
that's right
you're so good you can put underscores in domains
So...
2 guys who made PHP are from Israel
But
Israel uses ASP!
:O
lol
Viperidae, are you here?
Yes
There is something weird going on with my code..
What?
I have this C# code: http://puu.sh/iuk8j/02a2fc4eac.png
http://puu.sh/iuk8C/7ca44b7d4b.png
It generates a working key.
But when I try to do the same thing in Python or JavaScript, the key is wrong.
I don't get why.
The funniest thing is that the generated key is only partially wrong
Parts of it match the key that is being generated by the c# code
For example, for the id 00000, the working key is
VWPL-9LL7-GL15-15KQ
Python says:
STNK-9KK7-GK15-15JO
Weird
Well
Parts of it are nearly correct
It's fucking weird
I think Python's native integer size is 64 bits
I don't know if that has anything to do with it
That shouldn't matter
I tried masking the output with 0xFFFFFFFF
Didn't change anything
Weird, I'm assuming that some operator is implemented differently than it is in C#
splitty_: from something import <class, enum, everything>
And also, python does floating point division with the / operator
For floor division you need to do //
TheBrokenKeeper I don't divide anything :D
Good for you then
Also, python's for loop is actually a foreach
Not good for me. It doesn't work. xD
You can do: for i in range(5), it will itterate through 0-4
splitty_: http://www.pythoncentral.io/pythons-range-function-explained/
That isn't even my problem :D
The id generation works fine
TheBrokenKeeper: http://puu.sh/iumge/2645e348ac.png
I don't even know your code
Didn't look
My problem is that it generates a key that looks roughly like the key that should be generated :D
See my example above
C# key: VWPL-9LL7-GL15-15KQ
Python: STNK-9KK7-GK15-15JO
Only small parts of the key are correct
And I have no idea why.
Have you tried print debugging?
Or putting a breakpoint and stepping through the code?
You could do that in python?
Yes...

Just click it
Aviv, Doof means dumb in german
Oh
Well then

Does Gruntos have a built in IRC client yet?
Also, why does Skype suck so much?
It doesn't
They fixed the http://: thing
His parachute failed, but it looks like he was burned too so I'm assuming the heat shield failed or something
at least I can safely say Skype is better than Hangouts.
Or it just blew up, but who knows.
"I hope so... And please try not to express your dissatisfaction about something towards people... As a future advice from someone from the land of phillosophists... wanting your own good ;)" - Flopad to me
He was a russian astronaut who was reluctant to go into orbit because his craft was very unsafe, but the great Soviet Union sought to send him to space anyway
Aviv: When the fuck will they stop with re-making communities that will always die?
Apparently a US listening post picked up a transmission of him cussing out the people who made him go on the mission, despite his safety concerns as he reentered Earth's atmosphere.

This is apparently the carbon imprint of some Japanese guy in Hiroshima
When little boy went off, the flash bleached the concrete. This guys shadow allowed for such an imprint to be created
Thanks for sharing
Damn I wonder what the story behind this picture is http://i.imgur.com/vDpsp.jpg
90% of the time I regret clicking on images from you
Aviv: Don't click imges from Viperidae or fucking splitty
It's a rule
ok update the topic to include Viperidae
Come on that one wasn't even that bad
I didn't even look at it
I'm done with clicking links on here that are too vague
The first one was a shadow...
The second one was a skeleton...
I know about the shadow
That's why I didn't click it
The shadow was literally just a shadow though.
There was no gore in it
at all
or anything
I know
I already know the photo in perfect detail so why should I click again?
What?
I'm saying it makes no sense why you wouldn't click the second one because of the first one...
That's not the reason
I didn't click the second one because of the history of images you link
But, there's actually history to them...
Like, I could just go on /b/ and find random gore
But these actually have stories to them
And good ones too
Right
A sane man doesn't search for gore with story, a man searches for porn and nudes
I wasn't searching for gore...
I was reading about Hiroshima
and I still am
xDDD
Nullz are you here?

splitty_: You sure that it's the right thing to do?
splitty_: You know cicada 3301, right?
Should we gather the smartest people on int0x10 and try to decode them?
Dafuq
splitty_: What?
What would this code do? http://pastebin.com/yPN69Xbf
Interesting.. where did you get that from?
This doesn't look like any assembler language I know.
That's Z80 assembly
wow.
That makes it even more interesting
https://www.reddit.com/r/Solving_A858/wiki/201109091923
The interesting A858 thing
You talked about Cicada 3301 earlier
There was no new cicada 3301 puzzle this year
Yes
It would have been posten on 5th of January
Did anyone solve the last year one?
Not sure.. I think so
Interesting
Well... Then we'll wait for next year
They haven't finished the last one yet!
Last part: http://uncovering-cicada.wikia.com/wiki/CICADA_3301_2014_PUZZLE_FACTS_PART_9
Ah yeah. The 2014 one wasn't finished.

In what context?
TheBrokenKeeper
Nobody knows
Looks like a fnv164 hash
It's what A858 posted as moderator info when he moved a subreddit to private
Can it be decoded somehow?
It's a hash.. xD
Rainbow table?
I guess you can't write a very quick hex bytes to png image tool, could you?
I don't have no fnv164 rainbow tables.. xD
And no. :D
And run it on this: http://pastebin.com/bey66AVe
Is 0A signature for anything?
No idea..
Wait, line feeds
splitty_: http://pastebin.com/Hik26JLt
It's the same bytes as in the other paste
Just in somewhat of a text form
Line feeds..
Makes it unlikely that it could be an image. :D

WAtching a move but whos the girl splitty_
Nullz I met her in a chatroom a year ago
She was very unhappy and tried to kill herself a few times
Mainly because of her parents
And her ex bf raped her
And she was pregnant
But aborted.
Isn't she a girl from the Netherlands?
nope
That's weird
Why
That guy from last night, Silver, met a girl exactly like that a few months ago
loool
Exactly with the same story
interesting.
Yup
Do you know her name?
Nope
I once had a photo of her, but it's long gone
The girl I'm talking about is called Lea. :D
Anyway, one day she called me
And she told me that she were going to kill herself
She cried
So I talked to her for 2 hours
And eventually managed to to prevent further damage to her.
I haven't met her yet but we've been exchanging a lot of photos
And she's fucking sexy
She has a boyfriend again as far as I know
But that is no problem.
I will do anything that I need to do.
Give him free weed and he'll give you the girl
Now, can you get on a PM for a sec
?
TheBrokenKeeper sorry was afk
Get yer ass on PM
k
bacon, you here?
hi
Hello Ichiru!

Japanese please

ã?ãã?ã?¡ã?
Hey Ichiru
Hi splitty_
ë¬´ãã?ããíã´ë?´ã?
Cheeze, Korean sucks XD
ë¬´í¨ã?ã
ë ¤ì°¨
aka fuck
I'll stick to Japanese
It's easier
æ¥æ¬äººã?¯å®¹æã?§ã?
There, Japanese is easier.
Ichiru: When's the last time you got some bangers on your barby?
I don't have a barbecue
Therefore I can't cook sausages on it
I'm trying to learn the Aussie slang, it's not easy
1) bangers is very regional
and more british than australian
2) barbie most of the time
Though that may be just South Australia
Interesting
Now... I'm bored to bits
don't really try to learn to speak it
just to be able to understand it :P
But the Aussie slang is awesome!
"Dead horse" is the best one of them all XD
And disco biscuits
But now, I'll go. CS:GO
lel
i fell asleep on the floor >.>
Ichiru: Gâdonya mate.
we don't write it like that
Who cares?
Google is goodle
Google knows best.
In this case
I know best :P
But...
Google translates "From the bottom of my heart" in English
To "From the ass of my heart" in Chinese
google isn't good for language
AWESOME!
Links from splitty are forbidden?  Lolwhy?
Augment: http://agor.io/
Don't click it

Seen it before
Just a screamer
Yup
Fucking splitty woke up my parents this morning at 6 AM
I forgot the speakers on
And boom, he skyped me that
that agar shit is loud
Ichiru: Think about how loud that was at 6 AM...
x)
And fucking Skype fixed the http://: bug...
I wanted to kill his skype, but no... fucking Micro$haft fucked it all up
Ichiru: Wanna do some code breaking?
notes: comnoieragfdmshkuliouyutt
TheBrokenKeeper: I passed out on the floor earlier
I'm not in the mood for code breaking :P
But... it's easy...
(Insert your mum joke here)
Auggy, wanna find out what message I hid in there?
Who is this Auggy? I know an Augment,  but no Auggy
Also,  I'm ever so slightly on a phone atm
Okay...
Would you like me to make it even harder?
That's what she said
notes: ikeyuaighfdomshtuultocrnomo
There, it's the same sentence encoded in two different ways
Would you like me to make even harder?
make it*
Im on a goddamned phone
I can't really look rn
splitty_: Are you here?
Yeah
I have an idea on what to do with my game engine
I'll write a neural network and a vizualizer for it
lel why would you need that in a game engine?
As it can be basically used for anything
That's for a game
Not for the engine
Ahh okay
Nice
But now, I need to write that file format
Use PyBrain and IronPython for the game :D
I have something that works
Hi all
Hello
Hey Aviv
So, splitty, I have a file that works
But it's too primitive
I don't have a checksum, I don't have anything
It's not modular
It's primitive
Oh no
Well then I'll be back in a minute
splitty_: How to replace a file in C#?
Like, open a file stream, if the file is there override it?
You can specify a FileMode or something like that
With File.Open
I can't find the right file mode
All of them throw an exception if there is a file there
Yeah CreateNew throws an exception
Just use FileMode.Create
It will use FileMode.Truncate if the file exists and FileMode.CreateNew if it doesn't exist
Afaik
I'll use Create for now
K
Create should always work
I can't program
I've been staring at an empty class for the past 15 minutes
.
Viperidae, do you like ciphers?
Uhm, that question doesn't really make sense. Do you like hash algorithms?
I mean breaking them
I coded the same sentence in two ways, do you want the easy one or the hard one?
Classic ciphers aren't especially interesting
These aren't classic
*classical
Uhm, sure? But it better not be ceaser shift or something
It's not the classic ROTn or anything close to that
It's not
notes: comnoieragfdmshkuliouyutt
This is the easy one
Why is it just ASCII characters?
Also what is the key size?
I gave you what you need
I gave you the key, and then the cipher
You just said comnoieragfdmshkuliouyutt
notes is the key
How is the key derived from notes though? Like, what is the actual size of the key?
(In bits)
There's no need for bits here
A pen and paper and no math is all you need for this
Well then what is the character set used?
So then it IS essentially a classical cipher
^
Viperidae, all lowercase, just plain old a-z characters
No space?
And yes, it may be just a classical cypher
Who needs spaces?
I made the right choice by giving the easy variant XD
Is the first letter 'p'
Nope :P
You could make this easier by actually explaining how the key is derived from the passphrase 'notes'. Like, do you calculate a hash of 'notes' or something?
As I said, no need to calculate anything
Then what the hell is this :/
I'll give you a hint, each letter of notes corresponds to a number from 0 to 4
inclusive
Something that doubtlessly wouldn't stand up to a known algorithm scenario
Even with unknown key
I made this cipher with a very simple widely spread method
Anyway, with hand ciphers, you're better off with a deck of cards
Meh
52! arrangements
But this one is easy to figure out, I didn't make it impossible
Viperidae, would you like another hint?
And if you can construct a decent permutation you can use it as a stream cipher of sorts
Yes
You need to make a grid
Ah, ok. So it is a classic cipher xD
17:18 <TheBrokenKeeper> And yes, it may be just a classical cypher
cipher*
I said that a biy ago
Pen and paper?
Evernote?
Not near me
And poor network/storage more or less all music
If you want me, I can make a custom cipher
But I need to eat first
hiii
iiih
TheBrokenKeeper: What is the first letter in the plain text/
*?
I
Lowercase, but still
ok
Hey look there's a Viperidae!
I have an idea

Good.
I'll be CS:GOing
Eww

So Viperidae
When will Iodine replace PHP?
Woo!
eww csgo play a decent game at least
TF2 FTW
and WarThunder
hahaha I read that as play a descant game
Augment: TF2 doesn't run on this laptop
Well, it does
But I'm too lazy to install it again
I like to be a spy, dead ringer + your ethernal reward + classic pistol/revolver thing
Hello, Cameron.
Nawwww

Hai Aurora :3
Solly, stock rocket launcher (perhaps trading for black box for better regen), whichever banner gives you the health regen and speed boost (or possibly the minicrit one if running bb), escape plan - git gud TheBrokenKeeper
I like the spy
And not being to cloak in need is hard
With the your ethernal reward knife, I can't change my shape whenever I want to
I need to backstab to get my first disguise
And with the dead ringer I can only go invisible when someone hits me

Ewww Team Fortress, the art style of the game is repulsive.
You are either crazy or a Nazi
At least it isn't pretending to be photorealistic
^
I'm not talking about the graphics, just the way the models are designed. It's like a stupid cartoon
Thtat's the fucking idea...
Cell shading...
Flat colors with harsh changes in contrast and shades
I'm not even talking about cel shading
The way the models are designed
The models are highly designed
detailed*
Fuck
I'm not talking about details...
Then what the fuck are you talking about?
I'm talkning about the fact that the models are ridiculously cartoonish. Look at heavy for example, and look at how stupid the RPG thing looks
Oh then there is the stupid facial expression the characters make
And the fucking soldier's helmet covers his eyes
Like wut
http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3096/2529785262_3943aa8280.jpg
Augment: Do you get what he's complaining about? If so, please explain, I don't understand him XD
The game looks like a piece of a shit...
The game looks exactly the way the developers and designers intended
http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3096/2529785262_3943aa8280.jpg JUST LOOK AT HOW RETARDED HIS FACE LOOKS
Like a game not a military simulator...
I know, and that's why I question their sanity
Fucking play quake, or something
If you want photorealistic shit, fucking play Arma III
For an Arena shooter
Not fucking Team Fortress which literally looks like a vomited pile of shit.
Does quake have items, crates, trading, ways to make money, loads more items?
Play fucking counter strike then...
In CS it's too hard to get weapons
The art style of Team Fortress is so repulsive.
Subjective.
In 38 hours of playing I only got 3 weapons
http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3096/2529785262_3943aa8280.jpg JUST LOOK AT HIS FUCKING FACE
Besides, it's not like people play it for the art style
Just for fuck sake. If you dislike something, don't criticize the game because you dislike it
The gameplay is great
^
and that's what it's about
Do you have different classes in Quake? Nope
Do you have medics, soldiers, heavy classes? So on and so forth
Strategy?
At least the artists who designed Quake's models were actually sane.
In TF2 there's strategy. You get a heavy-medic combo, two soldiers in front and a scout running everywhere and you won the game
WHO FUCKING CARES ABOUT GRAPHICS?
But it looks like shit
I'm not even talking about graphics, Quake has horrible graphics. I'm talking about art style.
I play Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. It has shit graphics, but a great story
A fucking game is not about artstyle or graphics. It's about gameplay and story
There is no story to Team Fortress, it's literally a whole bunch of 12 years olds running in circles
Have you seen all the "Meet the x" videos?
Oh yeah those are retarded
But that's the story
Meet the medic is how the medic and heavy got together
And how he can provide invincibility to him and such
There's much more than surface things
You have to look at the actual meaning
I wouldn't call that a story, it's just a stupid promotional video by valve...
Look at Meet the Pyro
What is the pyro, male or female?
Also, it's fucking Valve
Developer of Valve Anti-cheat
The most stupid shit ever
You can hack in non VAC secured servers
All day long
They won't care
But you can't hack into VAC servers
And that is the problem
And there are a lot of unsecured servers
Well, it would have failed its job if you could cheat in VAC servers :P
You should be able to hack into VAC servers, hacking gameplay should be considered a valid form of game play
Because pieces of shit who steal games like you torrent the games
Look who's talking
Fun fact
You illegally own Minecraft, who knows how many games?
Fun fact, I have 240 bought games in my Steam library
I've never played TF2, Counter Strike, Quake, ect
66 in my Origin library
I just like trolling TF2 fans
I have 34 games on my PS3
14 on my Wii
But now I'm serious, there is nothing wrong with pirating games. But I don't pirate games, I don't even play games on my PC.
And about 22 more for PC on disk
There is a lot wrong
A LOT
There are people who spend countless hours working on something
They have families
Yeah, and they could have made it open source
But instead of spending time with their family, they make games that you steal
You steal food from someone's plate
They make tons of money..
That's a little hyperbolic
:P
Honestly
Information should be free
Yes because of people like me who support the developers and their hard work
Period.
So, you say that the whole computer industry should only have paid hardware?
You know that you're talking about the biggest industry on planet, right?
TheBrokenKeeper: well, some developers think hard work is creating one asset and charging for it
I'll pay for something physical, like a DVD with a game on it
I won't play for a digital copy
That's fucking retarded
I buy games for my Xbox, even though I have a flashed Xbox that I can just play burned games.
I would never pay money for a PC game, unless I thought it was really good
Because you can't put a price on information
Free as in free speech
You know you won't stop game developers selling games, right?
Not free beer
"21:50 <Viperidae> Because you can't put a price on information "
Please say that again?
That's right. You can't, you can't say that you're obligated to pay for information.
No, but from that information, people feed their families
Paying for open source software, for example that is protected by the GPL is like donating
And TheBrokenKeeper, that argument is so flawed it's not even funny
Then why pay for the software? Why not just have a donate button?
You act like if most games were open source, it wouldn't be profitable.
That's the biggest load of bullshit ever
BCUZ DONAT0nZ 4RE THE R00T OF ALL Ev1L
You either make something paid that you can only have access after you paid, or just have a donate button with everything for free
As much as it would be ideal to work like that, people won't work for nothing and design games.
And the promise of "donations" isn't attractive to workers
Exactly...
You can sell open source software
Especially those who could get a more reliable job.
Viperidae, donations are one thing
Paid software is another
Paying for open source software is like a donation
Because
You can, but then someone builds your software and distributes it for free.
Exactly
And then it's a waste of time and money to develop it.
Nothing is to stop someone who bought it from distributing it for free.
I'm not the only one thinking about that
Viperidae, there's lots of stuff that stops it (licenses, DRM, etc)
And you should be able to distribute ANYTHING you pay for, for free.
DRM is unethical
And so are licenses that prohibit it.
Do you care about piracy?
That breaks a lot of licenses
No, I support piracy
Exactly
You break licenses, copyright, everything
I don't personally, I don't pirate games. But I support those who do
Because I think they have a right to pirate it
I'm gonna go to sleep
I can't think right now :D
Good night
Night
Aurora, can you please explain to Mr. Viperidae how free software is not profitable?
BEEEP
You can totally sell open source games..
WRONG WRONG WRONG
And make money
It can be, but, obviously, non-free software is more profitable
Generally speaking
TheBrokenKeeper, hereby I invalidate your point.
And no, the argument "Free as in free speech, not as in free ber" Is not working for fuck sake
One person buys your game, he compiles the source, puts his name on it, redistributes it to everyone
Boom
You are nobody
And some jackass just stole all your work and made it his
As pirates don't care about licenses or copyright
I like to think of Minecraft as the perfect model for what open source games would be like, even though it's closed source; the source is out in the open (As mod developers know). No one does anything to stop piracy, you can look up on Youtube how to pirate Minecraft. There are cracked servers, for people who pirate it. And yet that is some how a very successful game.
Because the majority of people don't know/want to pirate, to be fair.
Regardless, without a premium Minecraft account you can't access alot of servers. Things like that, paying access for multiplayer servers, co-op, ect is other ways how game developers could make money. And before TTK says "What about Single player" there are alot of people who play Minecraft just for single player.
And those can fucking get it for free
And that's the majority of people...
It isn't the majority of people, and honestly I don't give two shits if the professional game development community died. What we would see is alot more indie games.
Minecraft was 100% indie until M$ bought it for 10 million USD
So?
Also
before then, it wasn't indie
It was
No, it wasn't
Okay, from 2010 until 2012 it was an indie company
Afterwards it stoped being indie
Yes, but that's not relevant in the slightest.
Information should be free as in free speech.
If you get 500k people to sign a petition for that, I'll be on your side
I don't give two shits what happens to the game development industry either
And guess what? I'd still pay for console games. I'd pay for a DVD
90% of indie games don't have physical copies...
And like 50% of indie games are basically free as in free speech
And the funny thing is I'm 99% sure you've torrented way more than I ever have in my life.
Until I was 8
And since then I bought games
For my Wii, for my PS3, for my PC
Phyiscal or digital
I paid for them
I didn't steal someone's hard work
So you were 8 when I first met you, because you've said several times in the course of knowing you that you need high internet speed for torrenting, and other things. Also you pirated CLions...
I was 10 or 11, not sure
But definitely not 8
I torrent movies
As in Romania, we don't have netflix
Nor good ways of buying movies
Did you not pirate it?
The only person to own it legally is bacon
He has a .edu email
Now, do you want me to not pirate it anymore?
I already said I have no problem with people pirating thigns...
and that includes me
8$, I get an ISIC card and boom
Free CLion
Nor CLions
not*
And I'd pay for CLion, or any game I thought was good if I had the money too
That's if its good
If it's not to my standards, then I won't pay for it
Well, I have over 350-400 bought games when a normal salary in Romania is under 200 USD
And you didn't play 60 USD for 99% of them because you bought them on steam...
Money is not an issue here
No, I paid 80 euros for Sim City, 60 euros for Watch_Dogs, 75 euros for COD:MW3, BO and BO2, each. What else... About 120 steam games were full price. All my Wii and physical PC copies are full price
I got Diablo 3, Starcraft 2, all full price, 80 euros each
400 games full is roughly 24,000 USD
You could buy a car with that...
Don't you think I regre buying at least half of those games?
Some of them were a waste of money
regret*
I doubt you've spent over 1,000 on video games..
I have spent over 3800 just on Steam games
Steam keeps ballance
or balance
Or whatever
I don't have my red squiggly lines under winblows
What a waste of money. I've bought like 4 games in the past 3 years
Well good for you
Thankfully, for steam you can now refund
But if you don't steam, then it would be pretty bad to buy a game and have it not work on your hardware
Viperidae are you trolling?
No
He's being a bitch about paying for hard work
He dislikes how people put coutless hours into developing software and then charging for it
That sounds like trolling tbh
It's not
He's really holding onto his idea
Viperidae: Can you explain Cameron how you're not trolling?
I've been AFK for the past 30 minutes, but half of what I say is trolling, and half of it isn't
I'll leave it up to you guys to figure out what part's are real or not.
Bye
Viperidae: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHXx3orN35Y
Wow, it's hard to read some of the messages though. This is neat
I'm curious how they did that
Viperidae: http://trixter.oldskool.org/2015/04/07/8088-mph-we-break-all-your-emulators/
Already read that
xD
Okay XD
But I'm very impressed on what they managed to do
Viperidae: I don't really get how people can push hardware limits so far. It's sad that we can't do the same with modern computers
The closest to hacking graphics is writing CUDA sofrware for nVidia cards
Descant $$$
TheBrokenKeeper: You probably can, but it's so hardware specific that it's useless
Yup
TheBrokenKeeper: "I play Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. It has shit graphics, but a great story"
You're kidding, right?
OOT has awesome graphics
I know
I was trying to find something for Viperidae
I own OOT
lol
Me too
It has awesome graphics and a great story
Fun fact: I actually play TF2 at school all the time and have fun
But I have it for the GameCube :P
So you are indeed an annoying fucker
and TheBrokenKeeper: it was not even close to 10 million USD for minecraft
it was 2.5 BILLION
I noticed
It was 10k the initial offer
k
But it seems like they settled on shitty 2.5
10 billion
Fucking fuck
I can't concentrate
Okay?
2.5 billion
ok?
I'm fucked
nope!
The initial offer was 10 billion. They seem to have settled on 2.5 billion in the end
10 billion is way too much for mojang
lol
Night ladies xoxo
Good night Cameron
we love you
<3
Aviv: It's really not
It REALLY is
They had three whole years when they were making over 450k euros a day
It's still too much
;)
Micro$haft has enough money
That doesn't make it worth it
because it wouldn't be at 10B
Meh
I like how Notch refused to take any money from the deal
Or any of the founders
They all left
Well, that was their choice
what has Microsoft done to hurt your minecraft experience?
Nothing
The founders sold it just because they didn't want the company anymore
Notch has vanished now and the other founders went to different companies
They just agreed that it was getting too big, they didn't want that so they sold everything
Ok then
Microsoft forever!
It's the same deal with how Notch have leadership of Minecraft to Jeb_
Microsoft is the evil empire...
And Notch barely did anything minecraft related ever since it became popular
Notch is just a hobbyist programmer, like all of us and codes for fun. I think it's obvious he got bored of Minecraft pretty fast
He got bored in two years
Microsoft is the evil empire... of awesome products!
Plus, Viperidae, I thought you liked evil empires https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b2/Galactic_Empire_emblem.svg/600px-Galactic_Empire_emblem.svg.png
^^^^
Oh here's the actual SVG https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b2/Galactic_Empire_emblem.svg
Viperidae: wouldn't it be awesome if Microsoft ditched java and rewrote minecraft in .net?!
Although, that's the emblem of the empire (Evil)/republic (Not so evil)
And that would be cool, the Xbox version of Minecraft is actually written in C#
I thought we were talking about the evil empire
Yeah we were
So is the the evil empire's emblem?
I'll sleep now
Bye bye sleep

Compute programs should be free if they are no longer in active development
Woo
Computer programs should be as in free speech, not free beer
People need to understand the following:
That does not mean you can't sell computer programs

so many word
too many word

pls0x Viperidae
we are not as good as you
Software should not have 'owners'. You can not 'take' software away from someone, you can only copy it. Supporters of proprietary software use terms such as "piracy" and "theft" to construct a flawed argument comparing software to physical property (Which it is not). Supports of proprietary software use exaggerations such as the economic harm to the owner, this is invalid as it relies on the assumption that people who copy the software written by
the owner intended on buying it. Authors of software claim a special connection with the software, and put their desires over that of the users of the software. They again act like software is a physical object, and modifying it is damaging their property; which it is not. As stated several times, you are only copying their software. Society needs information that is truly available to its citizensâfor example, programs that people can read,
fix, adapt, and improve, not just operate. But what software owners typically deliver is a black box that we can't study or change. And, above all, society needs to encourage the spirit of voluntary cooperation in its citizens. When software owners tell us that helping our neighbors in a natural way is âpiracyâ?, they pollute our society's civic spirit.
Conspirarcy theory!
How the hell does anyone derive a conspiracy theory from that :/
I was joking
Oh ok
But Viperidae
If everything is open source
then people can fork stuff
and nobody will make anything new
#levetted
That argument does not follow (I'm assuming it was supposed too not make sense, but you're sarcasm is sometimes irritating)
Yeah man make it obvious.
I like fridays
Viperidae, how do you feel about feminism?
I feel that modern feminism we see on Tumblr is not actually the advocation of womans rights, its more or less female supremacy. I don't have anything wrong with equality for women, but I feel that alot of the modern way feminists invent things that don't actually exist (IE: Rape culture)
Same
so whats up guys?
Not much, I think I'll try to do some work on Iodine tonight. I haven't done too much on it this week (I've been busy partying, and wasting time with Minecraft)
seems fun
What age do you usually get to go to parties at?
Make dreams, not dreams.
Lol I don't really goto parties. Castiel (You may or may not have seen him) got me in on this stupid picnic on a Navy base. We basically just went there to get free food and hangout at the beach. So, I don't really get involved in parties; atleast not the kind you think of.
In all reality, I don't really socialize too much; and am probably the last person to get invited to any sort of high school "Let's get wasted" party
lol, I dont want to get involved in parties with beer and sex and stuff ether.
Yeah, the people who go to those at my school are morons
Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slSc_DX2MDM Or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waYpEQAYf3g I can't make up my mind!
I think its like that everywhere
Viperidae: did you miss the levett part?
Sheep one
Because suicidesheep is love
kk xD
Levett thinks open source is BAD
and must be STOPPED
Really?
Yes
Wow
He said that it needs to be stopped
because
if it is not
people will fork stuff
and nothing new will be made
and newer is always better
open source is awesome
The thing is I use pretty much all free software
Except windows because you will you'll see
First thing's first
You must abandon MyBB
Find a closed source .net forum or something
Viperidae. Upload to your youtube channel xD
ya make a long video about how you feel!
That wuld be depressing :|
*would
wait what would be
20:20 <Aviv> ya make a long video about how you feel!
how would talking about opensource be depressing
I dont know what you feel man
Oh, I thought he just meant in general xD
That would be an interesting video
It'd be a depressing one xD
Well what would it contain
Probably my life story and the people I hate and why xD
Hey mate
You said you know Java. Did you learn Java via watching modding tutorials (like I am) or do you actually know the coding language. Just curious thats all.
Regards,
Sev
P.S the mod isn't dead, just taking some time off for ourselves ATM
Hahaha
I heard "Sev" from somewhere before
wasn't that your partner on making the mod?
I'll explain when I am done eating
kk
Ok
So yeah, he was on my mod team
They only communicated with me on my Skype account GruntXProductins
*GruntXProductions
That account is no longer in use
I've been completely dark with them for the past like 6 months
nice picture of ice cream on it btw
Oh, that's a stupid inside joke actually
Anyways
I made a new Planet Minecraft account called Viperae and offered to join their team as a programmer
*Minecraft Forum
They have no idea it's GruntTheDivine
and I'm going to keep it that way for a bit
so your sev? I knew it! :D
wait
nvm
Viperae >.
!= sev
xD
I thought you owned the mod?
I do
So why are you dark again though?
I got bored of developing it
And I stopped using GruntXProductions because I'm still friends with Courtney on it
I don't like using skype in general though
Yeah same I'm wanting to create a cross platform chat program after I finish my game engine
My main focus on that chat program will be security/anti NSA
I wrote an IRC clone before
Nice
was it better than the original IRC?
DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2, December 2004
lol
Meh, it was pretty much just as good as IRC. The protocol atleast
I mean, I thought it was better than AIM
Continuing C++ course
0xcccccccccccc and thats how visual studio helps you out
lol
This course is so much better than the C one. The teacher actually talks as if you dont know everything and actually explains shit.
Good
The C course I took is probably why i dont like C
lol you just have to bing the error code!
Viperidae: can we please switch to yours?
Switch to what?
I never got an error code.. I didn't understand what he was teaching me in the C course though.
C doesn't have exceptions
So, when a function fails, it returns an error code
These are basically just integers.
returning 0 usually means success, but something like EPERM means an error with permission, so this would be returned by calling fopen on a file you don't have access too
return 1;
#swag
Yeah Ik xD.
ok
OMG hi aviv2
illuminati confirmed
aviv 2 is connected with a php script
lol
Don't you love aviv2, Viperidae?
I don't know how to disconnect the poor aviv 2, though
But yay he's here!
or is PHP a she?
Aviv2 is too young for this world.
but Aviv2 has php power
and the page is just loading for a very long time hmm
nope
there
aviv 2 timed out thanks to php's 120 second limit
But it is working
hey welcome back aviv2
so sadly aviv2 can only stay with us 120 seconds at a time
time to kill Aviv2
Aviv2's killing is loading
hmm what are you doing Aviv2
there
takes a minute to turn off there
C++ is better than python
MotivationalSpeaker: should I keep developing Aviv2?

Whuy
Can we restrict bot testing to a different channel?
I love darin
Sorry
I'm done xD
Nah, it's fine I'm just saying we should have a new channel for this
The library I used is broken
And I dont want to fix it. rather figure out how to write my own
Ah, you'll have to use System.Net; remember that this server requires you wrap it with SSL (I can't recall the specific class used to do this)
hi
Aviv, can we have a channel specifically for testing bots?
#robots
I had #aviv2 lol
join aviv2
Did
now my bot has joined
lol that was a command for the bot
well then
(To prevent him from constantly autojoining here)
I hate social media

hi [sleep]splitty_
Would anyone like to try to build Iodine on Win32?
I feel like rewriting Iodine in C# now
Why, I don't know
I could make a time lapse of this!
I would Viperidae
Aviv: Make a timelapse or rewrite it?
Neither? just keep iodine in its awesome state
I was talking about 23:05 <Aviv> I would Viperidae, but C++ is beginning to irritate me and I feel like I could be more efficient in C#
Just believe
I don't want to scrap this project, because Iodine is pretty awesome.
Rewriting Iridium in C# won't be that hard, and C# has automatic garbage collection.
oh ok
*wants to be able to help you* *cant* *brb i gotta return to rebox* *i have 64 bit or else i would be able to build on 32 bit* *try getting 32 bit vm on virtual box* *why am i tlaking like this* *ttyl*
Hahah, kk. I'll start recording a new timelapse of me rewriting it all in C#
I think I should be able to do this pretty fast
Viperidae: Aviv2 said bye
And so did I!
Bye!
Alright, goodnight
Cant wait for you to upload it! :D

You need to order another 10GB
:P
My laptop can only handle max of 8 GB
Now...
I have two sticks running at 1066 MHz each
Why the heck does Window tell me that the memory speed is 4199 MHz?
Even my poor CPU is at only 2.3 GHz max
Because Windows is too smart :p
I'm forced to Windows because nobody made an easy to use port of DirectX for Wine
This is genius! http://9gag.com/gag/aw70YeB

also, fuck you, still stuck on 3.5

Aurora01, my fucking blanket covered the fan thing ð
Oh, well, that's your fault isn't it :P
Kinda
Descant will be getting notifications and PMs soon.
Well, more accurately, it already has notifications and PMs
There just isn't a front-end display.
Summon Aviv already
./summon aviv
ThePhoneKeeper, Nullz
I need your help :D
Can't
hmm k
TheBrokenKeeper, notifications work in Descant now.
Aurora01: Awesome
I've just got to implement the PM sending and reading, then it'll be perfect
Hello Aurora01 Emily splitty_ TheBrokenKeeper

Hey Ichiru

This is... wow.
Rebooting
lol
splitty_: Can you blieve it?
That's not even their flag though
What do you expect?
It's freaking North Kore, porn is banned there
Korea*
I also have 6 GB of RAM finally
And shit moves fast now
To be fair, porn isn't banned there; just access to the normal internet
And I expected http://www.mapsofworld.com/flags/images/world-flags/Democratic-People'S-Republic-of-Korea-flag.jpg
If that is legit, that is probably from high ranking North Korean officials
Interesting
They have access to the normal internet
You should have the app, don't you?
Or whatever
What app?
Doesn't PornHub have an app yet?
I don't know, I don't have it and I like never watch pr0nz on my phone
So you don't have fun at school?
:|
I'm...
Going to pretend I didn't hear that
But everywhere in the world, school breaks == porn time
splitty_, Augment; What are your opinions on this?
What?
scchool breaks == porn time
To me that's a no
You don't have to fap...
It's still a no
Just watch and enjoy
How boring of a school do you spend your time in?
Apparently not bored enough, since I've never viewed pr0nz at school before...
*boring
Wow... That's... Why didn't you? It's not like you can't enjoy it...
In my class, even some girls like it xD
That... no.
^
Watching lesbo porn with girls next to you is awesome!
Your school sounds really fucked up...
First off, I generally spend school breaks just lurking with people
Like, really fucked up
I spend school breaks talking with girls
No one does that at my school, and if they tried too they would be branded a creep and a weirdo
And sometimes, I watch porn, and girls seem to like porn
This could very well indeed be why you don't have a girlfriend
It's because I broke my leg the day I told a girl that I like her, that's why I'm still single...
Have you watched porn with her?
wtf
^
watching porn at school?
Never
do you not have things to do
like work
^^^^
or updating social media? :P
^^^^^^^^^^^
In school, we text, chat, view facebook and watch porn both in class and on breaks
Or... y'know, generally not being a creepy fuck
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It's not my fault that girls like lesbo porn and I'm the only one in class with unlimited mobile data...
'girls like lesbo porn' dat generalisation doe
What?
I'm probably the most fucked up SOB in my entire school, and I don't do that; nand does anyone I come in contact with
I like lesbo porn too
But there just aren't enough dicks... D:
Lesbo porn is great just because of that. Females only :D
The day people start watching porn in the middle of class will be the day I leave this country
In Romania it's quite a common thing, like really
There's nobody who doesn't do it XD
explains why so many people leave
^
also i find that slightly hard to believe
^^^
So do I
Makes three of us
When I get back in class, I'll photograph it...
But currently, I can't even see trees or sunlight
Get an aussie to come into your school and film it documentary style
"here we have our fucked up romanian children"
I don't know any Aussie people
teens* Ichiru, teens, not children
Also, Ichiru, wanna come to Eomania and "film it documentary style"?
Eomania?
you made that sound suggestive
^
so no
and also no
Documentary style the latest sex position that EVERYBODY is doing
Romania*
XD
What if someone pays your ticket?
Flight ticket that is
( Í¡Â° ÍÊ Í¡Â°)
I'm really amazed that you people don't watch porn in school... Like, for real, in Romania it's a common thing.
at school i like
lean
learn *
lol
or socialise with people
Learning? at school? a shocking thought, haven't done that in years
Am I the only person to not ever open a book and be 4th in the whole class with a straight A-?
my school has standards
and is the 4th*
you actually have to study to get good marks
My school also has standards
Same here
Everyone in my class studies
But simple physics is not hard
Caculus is easy, trigonometry is also easy
Grammar, fuck that shit
English, I guess you know the answer
we cover a lot of content in short periods of time
Same here
But internet over the years helped me
I just have to pay attention in class and I learn things
I hardly do, because the qualifications we do here are piss easy, but people still make a massive drama over them
Alright.
Server went down.
I was out most of the day.
I don't moderate this shit.
Interesting
im back
Took a shower
And I still can't believe the watching porn in school thing
Viperae, i wasn't here, go on.
09:51 <TheBrokenKeeper> I'm really amazed that you people don't watch porn in school... Like, for real, in Romania it's a common thing.
interesting.

Well...
It's not that you are, but...
Well
Let's just...
Mmmhmmm
You are a bit of a dick for not wanting to help me with logs
What?
You never even asked me too..
If you go back to your old name
10:31 <TheBrokenKeeper> But I need the freaking logs from you...
Logs will show up
That's what I'm talking about
Uhm, wut
If I open a PM window from your old link, it pre-buffers the latest discussions

Fuck
Then just use Viperae
But that means I have to find where Smuxi keeps it's logs
And manually look at what I told you last time
It isn't that hard to find where it saves log...
Why'd you change your nick?
TheBrokenKeeper: Quickly find your logs
I already got them

Viperae!!!
Come see what amazing new thing that aviv2 does!
Viperae: You wanted it...
So I'm writing Iodine in C# again!
And recording it!
Why?
I don't know, I feel more productive in C#. I guess the main reason is so I can easily integrate it in .NET stuff. C++ Iodine works, but I'm getting bored of writing C++, but I don't want to give up the project
Nullz wants me to upload more stuff to my channel, so I'll be making another timelapse thing
Awesome!
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died
We started singing
Bye, bye miss american pie
Drove my chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin' "this'll be the day that I die; this'll be the day that I die."
splitty_!!!
ughh
I facebook stalked a cute guy
and found out he is a total weeb
ruined
uhm ok Ichiru
hey you gotta find out if someone's crazy before you start chasing after them
Right
He's right, I guess

I can vouch for that
Well. That's the best advice anyone can give...

At 0:34
It's like a cut scene for a CoD game
Aviv: Will you be able to finish that website in one week at most?
I think so
Yay :D
From monday in a week I'd like it to be finished
OK!
so the 29th?
Yeah
But if you can finish it any time sooner, it would be great
ok
And maybe give me a prototype for Tuesday
lol Viperae
lol splitty_

Well, my enter key fucked it up

LÃ¤uft bei dir
Nicht viel
I hate pretending to be happy when I'm fucking unhappy. :/
I know exactly how that feels...
I have to do that daily
Yeah ikr..
Why do I want to learn German?
Like, I really want to learn it, but all online lessons are shit
They only teach you how to talk in public, how to order something, but not how to have a conversation with someone
TheBrokenKeeper learning German using an online course is not easy..
You will learn the words, but not the stuff like der/die/das and proper syntax
That's the problem
The best way to learn it is probably to live in Germany or to take a local course that's more in-depth
No, the problem is that you won't learn the words, only pre-made sentences
Example: "Can I have a drink?"
You should take a look at memrise
But...
There are some very good courses
It's wierd
Nah it isn't
It really helps
It has sound
Yeah that's really helpful.
You hear how a word is pronounced everytime
Or not, when you have family near you and no headsets
Did you know that it is possible to adjust the volume?
:D
wow
I never knew that!
For all 14 years of daily PC use, I never knew that you could do that
Wow!
I hope you know I'm joking, right?
No you aren't
/kill Aviv die.
Mean!
I'm gonna go to the gym
See you guys later
`say(bye splitty_)
aww Aviv4 failed.
Aviv4, you've failed me
silly aviv4

bye splitty
There.
woop
Bye :D
bye!
`die()
Aviv bots only come in multiples of 2
I am going to make Aviv2 better now
Viperae: what are you doing atm?
Hwllo
Hello
ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGH
My work on Descant has been lost because everything exploded.
So the notification system will be delayed slightly.
PING
By the way, TheBrokenKeeper or Viperae, can you drop my nickserv registration?
I've lost the password to it.
And kill Aurora01, please.
Aurora01: would you like to meet the second worst IRC bot ever?
Yeah
Is it JacoBot?
Nope
It's Aviv2
According to TTK's she's better than JacoBot
So therefore second worst
Aurora01 did you fuck your computer up?
Windows Update killed it
They send a bad update
Which practically bricked it
So I had to reinstall everything
But windows is the best..
15:24 -NickServ (NickServ@services.int0x10.com)- The nickname Aurora01 belongs to a services operator; it cannot be dropped.
Wow...
Damn
spooky
I'd SSH into the server and make one, but I'm kind of recording right now and don't want to disclose anything sensitive.
I'll do it then in a few minutes
Ok
You're recording?
Yes, I'm recording a timelapse. I'm rewriting Iodine in C#
Neat-o!
Viperae, you need to make it good enough so I can write IoDjango
Or [insert witty name for it here]
xD
I would think that your recorder would have a pause button
but ok
For some reason, Windows never asked for a product key when I installed.
xD
Hmm
Sounds
fishy?
I'm using recordmydesktop. which is command line
Wow...
I'm sure there's a way to pause it, but I don't know how to. I do Control C which sends SigInt, which then makes it render the video. It takes forever to render
Aurora01: Soo... Thanks for pointing out that the latest Winblows update wrecks your computer
Hahaha
Windows
I'll not update then XD
Nothing compares to the live updates in Kernel 4.x
To be fair, I think I broke it weeks ago, but since Windows always just hibernates, it didn't show itself as an error.
Interesting
Until I restarted
Also, Dropbox is good for storing passwords and such
Maybe a KeePass file on it or something
Yeah, just store them in text files.
Remember to put them in public places so you don't forget the URL.
True, very true. Plaintext out in the open is the latest place anyone would lookj
look*
And that's kinda true. Like, if something's in front of you, you won't notice it until it's too late
Basically, I've lost my safe-mail.net email now, since they don't allow password resets.
I can't find my oper password or nickserv password
Wow...
That must suck a lot...
Oh wait, I've just realised that I can't access the Descant server now.
Even better...
Since that's linked to my safe-mail account
Which is, rather conveniently, dead.
You sure a full reinstall was a good choice?
It was the only choice
It was boot looping
Live CD?
Linux?
It can read Windows file systems
Well, I only had my recovery USB stick
Go to a friend's house, burn a live CD?
Oh wait.
For some reason, Windows has found my user folder
So I can get everything back
hOORAY
AWESOME!
Oh, and I also found all my work on Descant
Even better
Essentially, I still have *everything*
Without the issues.
Good :D
This is an awesome documentary http://www.3sat.de/mediathek/?mode=play&obj=51513
Welcome back, Aviv.
No! windows is gooooooooooooooooood
I'm going to install any uninstalled updates now
Well, burn a repair disk first :P
Nope!
Just because I think windows is that good
Don't blame me then when the inevitable happens
http://i.imgur.com/ajraaS5.png hmm or not
Interesting
Is there anyone here who actually enables windows update?
Me
Anyway the support says I have to wait
Woo windows!
Eww Micro$aft Winblows
*Micro$haft
Viperae: Don't steal without credit...
wut
I made Micro$haft...
cNo
*No
Yes.
You didn't
You were all Micro$oft
People have been calling it it Micro$haft Winblows ever since Microsoft Winblows 98 was released
I made it up from a youtube video with a Windows 95 parody from 2001
But it was never on the IRC until I pulled it up
You sound like some PPTOSer arguing because someone is using the sane name as their PPTOS....
Right
In 97 there was a parody of Windows 95 called Microshaft Winblows
*Same
Now, Cicada 3301 woke up
Wtf is that
Wait
Did you follow my advice?
With the robotic dog and fleshlight?
And named it Cicada 3301?
...
Viperae: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicada_3301
Why don't any of you guys know about these things...
IDK
Like, splitty didn't know about A858
Vippy doesn't know about Cicada 3301
Oh wow
Could be NSA
It's not the NSA
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microshaft_Winblows_98 yay!
It's been happening for a long time
No one knows...
People have been decoding Cicada 3301 messages, sorta, hardly
TheBrokenKeeper: The NSA isn't a new thing...
I know
Now, do you at least know about a858?
Nooo
No
Oh you linked to that yesterday
Viperae: These are some Cicada 3301 messages: http://uncovering-cicada.wikia.com/wiki/Category:May_2014_Runes
Yes
Viperidae, here is the transcription: http://sprunge.us/ePKL
Interesting
Viperae: Trnasliteration: https://titanpad.com/y1l0E8t6fh
Look at the last transliterated page
It makes perfect sense
banned!
http://www.reddit.com/r/cicada/comments/2ruala/status_of_cicada_2015/
This is probably some government agency
I'd love to work for the NSA
Right
Viperae: can you ban Aviv4 too?
Or basically any cool three letter agency.
Thanks
Is Aviv4 made in VB?
No, PHP still
Viperae: Nobody knows
But people who followed the 2012 one, the end linked to a location somewhere on the planet
I didn't say it was, I said it's probably a government agency. That makes the most sense.
Aviv4 will die now
Aviv4 was a failed project
And those people, I'm not sure, they are either rich now, or missing
I forgot which one XD
But why the fuck am I the only one to know about these cool things?
Viperae: http://uncovering-cicada.wikia.com/wiki/Uncovering_Cicada_Wiki
I've already come across this
Well, I've got to go now.
`die(Aurora01)
GOODNIGHT
NSA is awesome.
#FightTerrorismOrDieTryin
Let's just... Privacy is better than being spied upon.
Writing malware to take over powerplants though sounds like so much fun!

â¢ The organization is in no way linked to any military, or the government of any country. However, they recruit often among high government officials to gain more power
This is Cicada 3301
I'd do anything to get on the team that designed stuxnet, regin, flame, ect
And it looks like they've existed for a long ass time

No

it does seem though if this email is credible they represent the hacker culture
" Do you believe that information should be free?"
IKR
you're too cool TheBrokenKeeper
Information should be free
Totally
But, work should not be free
unless Viperae should not say so'
Oh god, here we go
For fucks sake, no one says work should be free
That's communism.
I won't start the same thing as last night
If you think that proprietary software should be protected by law, then you do not think information should be free.
You know what's funny?
Richard Stallman, a professional programmer made money and was paid to program by big companies. The software he was developing was free software
Information as in knowledge should be free
That includes programs
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-free.en.html
Information as in bear should be paid
Viperae knows about the bear..
Don't you, honey bunny?
:|
Aviv is right
as per usual
:) <3
omg amazing http://fab-top.com/
Why the heck do I want us to start something like Cicada 3301
Don't know
Aviv, that is truly amazing!
yeah
Aviv Does Fabtop Still Occasionally Type Like This
Viperaerae, wanna think about something like this? Tomorrow, with Aurora, Splitty and bacon all at once?
No, Viperae
Why Did He Do That To Begin With
It Is So Annoying

TBK: If you guys can come up with something creative, I think I don't think any of us could come up with anything for geniuses though
What'ya talkin' 'bout, Viperae?
lulz turn Vulcan botnet on his MC server
oh god
I wonder if Reagan would kill me if I did that
Well, you know, not for geniuses, but, for smart-ish people
We can hide things in plain sight, learn criptography, stenography, so on and so forth

That said
"When will you (formal) learn it?

Wow
Google translate sucks balls then
It does
"When did you learn ?" <-- Google Translate 2015
3/3 of the other translators I used got it right
Although one said When will he learn it, but that's technically still right
because you formal can also be he or she
after looking at http://www.spanishdict.com/conjugate/aprender too, I have no idea where google got when did

Never...
Korean doesn't even use that writing system
It uses Hangul
Well

That was "Hangul" and "banana" in Korean

I fucked it up...
ok
But notpe
Microsoft's Korean input system sucks ass...
One sec...
Yup
It's very broken
Japanese works perfectly with Microsft IME
YAY
I managed to install twisted.
For what version of Python?
Viperae: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTFa6dwCEiA
splitty_: You know Cicada 3301?
Yes
Uhm TheBrokenKeeper?
Me?
I am trying to write a irc bot in python 3
I installed Twisted using pip
Twisted for Python 3 is broken
wut
really?
Also, Viperae didn't know about Cicada 3301
And yes, really
Aurora had to use Python 2 for ChatterPy
Like I was supposed too..
You were...
Don't you live on this planet?
No, I wasn't :P
It was all over the internet a few years ago
Says the same person who said everyone in the world watches pr0nz in class xD
Normal people do...
dafuq
Splitty_: Do normal people watch pr0nz in class?
At school
With their friends
No. xD
^
Exactly.
I said girls...
Normal people don't watch porn with their friends. xD
Not guys
Only girls
Why should you watch porn with a girl
right splitty_
Just have real sex with her
But TheBrokenKeeper is special
Feels better than porn
Splitty_: When you were in high school did guys watch pr0nz with girls?
No. xD
You people are old...
You're old too, TheBrokenKeeper!
I swear to god if anyone does that at my school I'll be the first person to drop!
I'm 16... Yes, I'm old
splitty_: Now, why the heck didn't Vippy know about Cicada 3301?
And splitty_'s right, who the hell watches pr0nz with girls?
I have no idea, TBK
I'd do alot more than watch pr0nz with a girl, unless she's a fucked up girl who has my sort of humor and would watch shock videos with me; but I wouldn't call that porn (Unless you are sick in the head0
*)
Cicada 3301 was everywhere a 2012/13/14 :D
remove the a
I know
The future... is in the past!
I'm amazed that Vippy didn't know about it...
Me too
Viperae: knows everything
splitty_: People are either idiots or can't see things...
even more than everything
So I'm an idiot because I don't pay attention to reddit/4chan/x for strange crypto contests..
Right

Take a look at that...
It's solvable
Splitty_, TheBrokenKeeper: Remember those Anti-OCA people who kept sending us weird messages?
I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sdlgv4E75w
I do now
Yeah, they had strange messages and some sort of weird character set
That looks like plain old simple Greek characters
That isn't greek :|

oh lol
that's middie
he does that
You know, the more and more I think about it; the more Middie deserved everything that has happened to him and Midtown OS
Really now?
Oh yay this is getting recorded
Yes, he seems like a little fuckwit
Actually, it isn't anymore
But he's still a fuckwit
oh ok
Good
wouldn't want to watch Iodine and see that dora image again
^
Yeah
lol
you could always edit it out though
anyway
Is it like rendering?
Yeah, I record in like hour long intervals
Then stop and let it render
TheBrokenKeeper
Are you here?
oh ok Viperae
Yes
I switched to Python 2 and recompiled Twisted. Everything looks fine now. But for some reason, I can't call connectTcp, run or stop on twisted.internet.reactor
Weird
Maybe just get rid of Python and use PHP
Nah
Dunno
Now, GET YOUR ASS ON PM NOW!
PHP is a lot faster with version 7!
Python is even faster
Oohhhohoho is it?
I think NOT
Actually
I'd bet PHP is faster
Zend uses a JIT compiler, right?
Oh wait
It does with 7
no it doesn't
Oh, well
5 does not
6 was derp
Hiphop is definitely faster than Python xD
7 will jit!!!
PHP 7 is 2x faster than 5 I think I read
chart on the state of phpng as of this month, presented at the conference, had the technology producing a 35 percent speedup on synthetic tests; 20 to 70 percent performance improvements on real applications, including a 60 percent improvement on WordPress home pages, and better memory consumption for most useful server APIs.
PHP fOREVER!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OL8LREmbDi0 This is a wonderful performance
nope
ok
so
what's new everyone?
Not a lot
WHY NOT AUGGY
DO SOMETHING INTERESTING!
Please!
"Auggy"
Vippy
It's no biggie
kk?
Who is this 'Auggy'
TÃº
I know an Augment, but no 'Auggy'
PHPForever: Use normal 'u' and you get the Romanian word for 'you'
Weird
Ok TheBrokenKeeper
SÃ­
Use the normal 'i' and you get the Italian word for 'yes'
and remove the s and the Ã­ and add a d and an a and you get the Romanian word for yes
and change the d to a j and you get the german word for yes
amazing!
Wat?
English is the official language of int0x10
No more speaking mexican
We don't speak wetback here
Inca putem vorbi limba romana, nu?
Romanian is acceptable.
Mexican is not
Yay :D

Viperae hows the C# time lapse going?
Great, I have to do it in small one hour chunks though
Then it takes a good hour or two to render xD
I understand the struggle

it is spelt correctly ;)
Viperae
how's the love life
Dead, lol. You know I got back with Courtney for like 4 days then I was like "Yeah, this is not going to work". Had some mad sex though. Btw this is being recorded (I'm filming a time lapse) so.... Hopefully IRC conversations will literally be only a split second in the video and I won't have to edit this out
ahahahha
okay then

So Syrup was just commenting on how much he loves Viperae!
wut
Viperae: why don't you ask Syrup for his religious views?
lolw0t
Uhm, like I said I'm kind of recording a time lapse of me writing an interpreter; so starting a classic int0x10 debate might not be appropriate?
aww
but Syrup!
Well then
Yeah pres is fun
next time maybe
BYE
So there was like 200 ants in my trash can
DAyum
Ok, so I'm like almost half way done with the time lapse

I'm going to reveal myself
Hahahaha, this is getting good
xD
did you record all of this?
It's logged on Skype
God damn Power went out
ah
so howd it go
howd they react
It wasn't as dramatic as I hoped
Send logs?
Can't
I'd have to get on Skype again
I'll do it tomorrow
But I told them I was going to go
Alright
Did they get mad?
no

Hey Aurora01
I'm writing a bot in Python2 using Twisted
But I'm having a few problems
Hmm, what's the issue?
I can't join the channel #splittys_witness
What's the error message?
There is no error message.
Code please
The bot joins but it just doesn't join the channel.
Have you tried Turing it on and off again?
I'll leave.
:D
Code please
:P
http://pastebin.com/txM1HH7r
Move self.join to connectionMade
It's weird. The bot loses connection every few seconds
Lost connection ([Failure instance: Traceback (failure with no frames): <class 'twisted.internet.error.ConnectionDone'>: Connection was closed cleanly.
]), reconnecting.
I have the following code in my connectionMade override:
for chan in str(self.factory.channels).split(','):
self.join(chan)
The channels are in the format #channel1,#channel2
You should store them in JSON
I tried printing the channel names and it looks like it's working
It's much easier
Yeah I'll do that later. But it should work anyway.
However, that isn't the issue.
I don't get why the bot is disconnecting every 3 or 4 seconds
Does it enter the network at all?
It joined #int0x10 before TBK banned it from this channel
Try it again now
Weird.
It joined before.
Perhaps there's something wrong with your nickname generation
Try hardcoding it
I hardcoded the nickname 'witty'
It says that it's joining #int0x10 and #splittys_witness
Hardcode it in the WittyBot class
Do I have to define a key or something?
For the channeÃ¶
channel*
Nope
It's not even connecting to this channel, so there's a bigger issue
You don't have to handle the ping event by the way
Oh, I know the issue
def ping(self, user, text=None):
self.ping(user, text)
That's just infinite looping
Until eventually the twisted reactor gives up
oh
I removed it. The signedOn override doesn't get called
Didn't change anything
Are you trying to connect now?
Yes
It says connected to server but it doesn't call signedOn
Well, I can't see you connecting
Override the rawDataReceived function
https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/8.2.0/api/twisted.protocols.basic.LineReceiver.html#rawDataReceived
In fact, no
Just the dataReceived function
https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/8.2.0/api/twisted.words.protocols.irc.IRCClient.html#dataReceived
Do something like this
def dataReceived(self, data):
print(data)
Nothing.
super(self, irc.IRCClient).dataReceived(data)
splitty_, do you mean it's not printing anything?
Oh
there are lots of errors
That may have been helpful to know.
:P
:irc.int0x10.com NOTICE Auth :*** Looking up your hostname...
:irc.int0x10.com NOTICE Auth :*** Could not resolve your hostname: Domain name not found; using your IP address (109.75.92.228) instead.
After that, just errors.
Well there were no errors before.
What sort of errors?
The error is super(self, irc.IRCClient).dataReceived(data) -> exceptions.TypeError: must be type, not instance
Oh, whoops, that was my fault then.
Remove that line
OOOH
Registration timeout
dafuq
That means that your client never actually sends the authentication data.
Oh, I see the issue.
You need to include irc.IRCClient.connectionMade(self) in the connectionMade function
https://gist.github.com/shnmorimoto/1717671 that might be useful for you
Oh. Interesting.
Do I have to upcall on every method I'm overriding?
No
Just the connectionMade and connectionLost
oh okay
Thank you
Can you ban witty again please?
What's the channel for the bot?
#splittys_witness
Hey watchmee
Wow
That's a watchmee...
G'day
Ichiru lied to me! They do use "G'day"

How's shazza?
Awww yeah, she's just down at the pub avin a few scooners
Got her Centrelink, just like Bazza?
Yeah mate, but bazza still on his compo so he's good for a shout
(Typical Australian conversation)
I saw him at the traino this arvo.
He was heading to maccas with Shazza.
Puarrr, she's cruisin for root
She's just looking for a mate, mate.
Maaaaate
Wanna come over for a breaky, vegemite toast and even cheese toasties, then maybe head down to Bunnings for a sausage sizzle.
Ah yeah, sounds mint
Uhm
Aurora01
I don't get inheritance. xD
Why not?
I made a class called PluginBase with a function msg(self,user,channel,msg)
It's so easy in python
And then a plugin called EchoPlugin(PluginBase) that orrivdes msg
Yeah?
When I try to instantiate the EchoPlugin, it says TypeError: Error when calling the metaclass bases
module.__init__() takes at most 2 arguments (3 given)
I don't get it.
Code?
Did you forget to include self as a function parameter?
Wut
no
PluginBase: http://pastebin.com/68ttpSci
EchoPlugin: http://pastebin.com/zsiMrsnq
Witty: http://pastebin.com/zX3SpDLM
Ignore the first import at the top of the file, I removed it.
In Python 2, make sure your classes inherit from object.
Yup
That could potentially be the issue
Changed PluginBase to inherit from object. Didn't change anything.
Python is so weird
Wow, for some reason I still can't understand Python code written by someone else
I can understand my code perfectly
But this is alien language
Or wait
I know why
Look at my nick...
I can't focus
splitty_, try this
from witty.plugins.PluginBase import PluginBase
I assume that your file is called PluginBase.py, right?
Yeah
Basically, what you've accidentally done is tried to inherit from the PluginBase module, rather than the class.
And then, things start to break.
wow..
Why is this even possible in Python lol
Dynamicness.
Okay just one more question
"Call to __init__ of super class is missed"
How can I call the constructor of the super class?
super() doesn't work, it wants 2 types
super.__init__ doesn't work either
super(self, Class).__init__()
TypeError: must be type, not EchoPlugin
super(Class, self).__init__()
Whoops
ohyay
:P
Descant notifications are pretty much done
Now to implement the PM sending form
I'll send Tony Abbott once done.
Sadly, they'll turn the boat around.

Haribo's MAOAM candy criticised for 'sexual' sweet wrappers
Joystixx <3
MAOAMs cause me tooth pain xD
Yeah they make me dislocate my jaw (like most of my other favourite sweets) but so worth it
xD
Well, technically it only makes me subluxate my jaw
"Haribo MAOAM sour candies feature 'fruits in pornographic poses'"
But enough that I have to force the fucking thing back in with my hands and endure the awful crunching sound as it pops back in
Where do I buy some?
Any major supermarket... In the UK and maybe the US, idk about elsewhere
Amazon apparently.
That too

Do you like the new feature, ThePhoneKeeper?
It's nice
I want to write a neural network
splitty_, you here?
Aurora01, are you here?
Yes.
How would memory in a neural network work?
I
I'm thinking about something like a reccursive system
But then how to get things out?
I don't know, take a look at PyBrain or something
I don't think it has memory
As it's a simple neural network
If you want long short term memory, you need to implement it yourself
"PyBrain has an emphasis on network architectures, which can be trained and manipulated with almost all of the algorithms offered by PyBrain. Here are some examples of available networks and network architectures:
Feed-forward networks, including Deep Belief Networks and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM)
Recurrent networks (RNN), including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures"
Interesting
But I want to implement something in C#
And I can't seem to be able to understand Python
I found a nice design of an LSTM cell
Wair
Wait*
I still don't understand how it works
maths mmkay
:P
Alright, I've never heard of PyBrain, will have a play with.

http://django-descant.rhcloud.com/static/descant/#/topic/283
It works
"
aurora01 reported I hate descant
just now"
It hyperlinks to the topic from the name
yay
Timey reported you too :P
TheTimeKeeper reported I hate descant
just now
"Thank you for your report. It has been processed by me, Aviv, and not Aurora01.
Goodbye."
Check your PMs, splitty_.
You have to use the Bootswatch theme to see them.

Heya
Hello, Emily.
Would you like to test some revolutionary new forum software developed by me?
splitty_, are you still working on the Material Theme?
Aurora01 yes, kind of.
Cool
I am trying to finish it in the next 2 weeks
You'll have to implement the notifications and other things that I've added since you started making it
However, I'm hoping to release Descant v0.2 in the near future, so you may as well target that for your theme.
Otherwise the API will keep changing
Aurora01, bug spotted
Where?
Oh
Nevermind
What was it?
The (1) next to the bell still showed up after I read Aviv's message.
But it now vanished. Probably took a few seconds to update
Yeah, it updates every 60 seconds
nice
btw, can you make it so that it updates when a post was posted/edited?
I need to refresh everytime I post something or edit a post
It should do it automatically
It refreshes for replies
Ah, not for topics
I see.
I will fix it
splitty_, done.
And uploaded
Descant now has over 400 commits

Hello, Viperae.
Dropping the 'id', now?
"hello".ToUpper();
Sometimes I like to mix things up
( Í¡Â° ÍÊ Í¡Â°)
HAPPY FATHERS DAY
Thats, errr, not something I have to worry about
i am now your father
new father*
riiight.
Do you have a mother?
Because if so, use fathers day to celebrate your mother and how she not only is your mother but also became your father.
If my mother had balls, she'd be my father.
( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/if_my_aunt_had_balls,_she%27d_be_my_uncle )
anyways
Aurora01, Emily, Viperae, bacon, Cameron, watchmee, TheBrokenKeeper, Augment
What
what?
U foken wot
I need your opinion
nikxda thinks my website is ugly, and he is a talented web designer.
http://splitty.de/
Please be objective.
Is this website ugly? If not, is there anything that is an absolute no-go for you?
To be fair, since it's so minimal, I don't think it can really be called ugly
I tried to keep it clean and simple and provide all the relevant information
Basically what Aurora01 said... It's not ugly but there's not really enough there for it to be anything much
It doesn't fall into my category of ugly. But it's too minimal, it does not scale nicely on my small resolution, so on and so forth
Okay thx
Basically, too much empty space
I could add some adverts
jk :D
Host a Descant forum there
:P
xD
ahahaha
add in a load of banner adverts
abuse Google Adsense
^
And then get banned
:P
xD
BAN ALL ADS!!!
Does nobody remember the Monkey Island series? Nobody at all? ;-;
I remember a game called Secrets of the Monket Island
And it's theme song
But that's it
Don't you just mean The Secret of Monkey Island?
Okay, okay...
I have never played it
http://store.steampowered.com/app/32360/
Only seen things
Classic point 'n' click adventure
Yes
The best one is #3, The Curse of Monkey Island, but there's no special edition of that
But this is the remastered version
Aye but you can switch back to classic version at any point, it's a bit like Halo Anniversary in that regard
Cameron: Original: http://199.101.98.242/media/images/96023-The_Secret_of_Monkey_Island_(CD_DOS_VGA)-5.jpg
Interesting
Well, I can't buy any more games
Indeed I remember the original
Cameron: This game is 9 years older than me
Amazing
Yup it's pretty old
The first one I played was Curse of Monkey Island
They just take the piss out of themselves so much https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-qMkIn59VU

Hi!
Hello Aviv!
Hello TheBrokenLogKeeper!
Hello, Aviv.
Soo... Will you be able to provide me with a small prototype for my website in 26-28 hours at most?
Let's see!
TheBrokenLogKeeper, just create a quick bootstrap thing if you're in a rush
Super fast PHP time!
Aurora01, I need to show working things unfortunatelly
Or remove an l from "unfortunatelly", forgot how it's right
Well, spend 1-2 hours making a quick bootstrap UI, and 1-2 hours with Django
I have spelling issues like those since ~10 years ago
Oh, and Aviv, when you get time, please add the notifications and PM templates for your theme.
It's done in the backend, and testable with the Bootswatch theme on the server
ok
Django ha!
You can do stuff much more quickly with Django
"Sure"
Aurora01, I cannot focus on anything currently
My nick should very much point that out
Well, don't leave stuff to the last second then
You've known that this project was needed for ages
I'm very much in a "fucking fuck my mother fucking life" state
Aviv said he can do it xD
I just need a prototype for now
Wow
Aviv has one more week of work
why are you "Fuck my life"
Yes, but Aviv is needed for Descant.
:P
He has enough time
wut
Who is witty_
xD
bot
Also, since when is Aviv TheFuckMyLifeKeeper's slave?
since the slave trade started up
^
back in the golden days of '15
2015, that is.

Yup
Aviv is actually immortal
No.
oh ok
Aviv is jesus
Him.
Him
In His greatest glory.
Haha.
Him is love
Him is life
Love, is Him
Life is Him
I just like capitalizing the pronouns.
BACK
Why're you logging my life, Cameron?
BRB now y'all
I'm not logging your life, TheBrokenLogKeeper is... Well he was before he changed his name
Oh
oh okay
How're you/who are you?
I AM CAMERON AND I AM GOOD THANK YOU
I am always logging
I'll give you the rundown: weird English 17-year-old from outer space who likes typing in all-caps. That's all anyone needs to know
Oh and Fall Out Boy and bacon
It's Cameroon, now.
<3 bacon <3
Me or actual bacon? 'cause I have no bacon.
Both
You are actual bacon, bacon <3
I feed that lie to people.
They eat it up like... bacon
Quite frankly I think you're being racist
YOU MONSTERS MADE ME HUNGRY FOR BACON
I had bacon for lunch. And MAOAM. Remember? Remember me creaming over my lunch?
Fuck you
Was your name always TheBrokenKeeper or is it just that because you're broken at the moment?
Cameron, I am a bigoted bacon, when am I never racist?
Okay then
My normal name is TheTimeKeeper
Or Chronium
But I'm very broken at the moment... Like, yeah...
And it's nothing related to having a leg in a cast
Life story
Which nobody will disclose here.
THETIMEKEEPER OHHHHH OF COURSE
lol
Really...
Fucking really...
lollllllll
And Chronium I think I knew that one first
It's not like I told you a dozen of times that I'm Chronium...
gj Cameron
Suddenly you're not some random swearing Romanian guy
Somehow I always manage to miss it

That's actually not a bad idea
To have an IRC device
I think something like that has been done.
It's a terrible idea to pipe instructions from IRC to a terminal
Especially a privileged one
(irc over cat)
It's the best idea!
Like, what could go wrong?
TheBrokenKeeper, do you want to access God Mode on Linux?
Well, if  by that you mean root access on the VPS then by all means, show me how to do it
Open up a terminal screen
Don't have any
I'm sorta very much on Windows right now xD
cygwin
I don't have black magic
Open up a Windows terminal then
But I do have the MinGW that came with the Git Bash
You're on Windows? I know how to get God mode on there
Just use a normal windows command prompt
Just delete System32
%0|%0
Git Bash then
Just type that
In the Command Prompt
Powershell?
Probably would work

Hello, ThePhoneKeeper.

My laptop is not frozen yet
Just log off and on again
Okay
I didn't think you'd actually do it xD
It's not like I can do that...
Log off...
Win 8.1 sucks
Press power button
Wait for a while
Accept my apologies.

I swear Windows 8.1 is getting increasingly unstable
It killed my baby yesterday.
Well, more accurately, it exploded and required a reinstall.

Yo Aurora01

It only made 65 instances of the command prompt
LOL

I'm sorry, ThePhoneKeeper.
But it wasn't close to frozen
It was running perfectly
I was testing your 6GB RAM, let's say
It was working perfectly still, chrome worked, YouTube worked, Smuxi did
Well, fuck you too Aurora01
What?
It's not like you fucking made my laptop open 65 command prompts
But I'm amazed that it still ran fine
Like, really, everything was perfectly running
Well, I was stress testing it for you
:P
This is a proof that I fall for shit too easily XD

Well
I'm forced to use Eclipse
over Intelij
:(
Why?
Because, Intelij isn't cooperating with Forge. I can just use the IDE and build from the command line; but that takes forever. Basically, Intelij works; except it doesn't build resources for some reason
Viperidae: You are crazy, right?
gradlew.bat setupDecompWrokspace idea
There
Boom
Uhm...
You *REALLY* think I'm that stupid and didn't create my idea workspace?
I already made a workspace and project with forge gradlew, and it builds just fine
What's the problem?
The resources don't build.
That's weird
I always used IntelliJ
And it worked perfectly
Like, no problem what so ever
Viperidae: Did you follow something like this? http://www.minecraftforge.net/wiki/Forge_Development_in_IntelliJ_IDEA
Yes... of course
I like Eclipse more though
That's really weird

Eclipse will automatically resolve classes that need to be imported

TheBrokenKeeper I think I'll go with Markov Chains
no don't
I don't know anything about how language processing works, you do whatever you feel is best
k
TheBrokenKeeper, Markov chains are really interesting
Right
A Markov chain is a random process that undergoes transitions from one state to another on a state space. It must possess a property that is usually characterized as "memoryless": the probability distribution of the next state depends only on the current state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it. This specific kind of "memorylessness" is called the Markov property. Markov chains have many applications as statistical models of real-world
processes.
But I'll use a continous-time markov chain.
Right
I once wanted to make a quantum computer based simulation of a 3*3*3 qubit matrix of all possible states in that matrix
But 27 qubits eat a lot of RAM to simulate
And then make something along the lines of changing something and viewing changes down the road
But it was impossible to make, I was too lazy to learn all the quantum math required for that
That's a shame
Objection: A Markov chain is not a neural net, and it won't follow syntactic structures and therefore won't produce syntactically valid English 99.99999 percent of the time
(I may or may not have pulled that statistic out of my ass, but... *shrugs*
Aviv: Don't forget
In 24 hours I'd like a prototype
Â¡Claro que sÃ­!
_prototype_
right...
what do you even mean by that?
I have no idea
Just make something that works
You'll have one more week to refine it
But I need something to show in two days

1:1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
1:2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
1:3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
1:4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.
1:5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
1:6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
1:7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
1:8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.
1:9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
1:10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
1:11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
1:12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
1:13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.
1:14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: 1:15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
1:16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
1:17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, 1:18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
1:19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
1:20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.
1:21 And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
1:22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
1:23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
1:24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
1:25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
1:28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
1:29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
1:30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
1:31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.
2:1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
2:2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
2:3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.
2:4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens, 2:5 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.
2:6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
2:7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
2:8 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
2:9 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
2:10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.
2:11 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; 2:12 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.
2:13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.
2:14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.
2:15 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.
_mute
2:16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: 2:17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.
2:18 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.
2:19 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.
2:20 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.
2:21 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; 2:22 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.
2:23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.
2:24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.
2:25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
3:1 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? 3:2 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: 3:3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
3:4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: 3:5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
3:6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
3:7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
3:8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.
3:9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou? 3:10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
3:11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat? 3:12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
3:13 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
3:14 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: 3:15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
3:16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
3:17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; 3:18 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; 3:19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto
the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
3:20 And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.
3:21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
3:22 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: 3:23 Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
3:24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.
4:1 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.
4:2 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
4:3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.
4:4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering: 4:5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.
4:6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? 4:7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.
4:8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.
4:9 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper? 4:10 And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.
4:11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand; 4:12 When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.

4:13 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear.
4:14 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.
4:15 And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.
4:16 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.
4:17 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.
4:18 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.
4:19 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
4:20 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle.
4:21 And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.
4:22 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.
4:23 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.
4:24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.
Viperidae, I muted it. It will still save all the stuff you're posting.
4:25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.
4:26 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.
5:1 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him; 5:2 Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.
5:3 And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, and after his image; and called his name Seth: 5:4 And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters: 5:5 And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.
5:6 And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos: 5:7 And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:8 And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died.
5:9 And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan: 5:10 And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:11 And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and he died.
5:12 And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel: 5:13 And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:14 And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died.
5:15 And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared: 5:16 And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:17 And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died.
5:18 And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch: 5:19 And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:20 And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died.
5:21 And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah: 5:22 And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:23 And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years: 5:24 And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.
5:25 And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech.
5:26 And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:27 And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.
5:28 And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son: 5:29 And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed.
5:30 And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:31 And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died.
5:32 And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
6:1 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, 6:2 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
6:3 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
6:4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
6:5 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6:6 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
6:7 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
6:8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.
6:9 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
6:10 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
6:11 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.
6:12 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
6:13 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
6:14 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
6:15 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
6:16 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
6:17 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
6:18 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
6:19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
6:20 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
6:21 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.
6:22 Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.
7:1 And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.
7:2 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female.
7:3 Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.
7:4 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.
7:5 And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.
7:6 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.
7:7 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.

7:8 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth, 7:9 There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah.
7:10 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.
7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.
7:12 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
7:13 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark; 7:14 They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.
7:15 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life.
7:16 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.
7:17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
7:18 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
7:19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
7:20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.
7:21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man: 7:22 All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.
7:23 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.
7:24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.
8:1 And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged; 8:2 The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained; 8:3 And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.
8:4 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.
8:5 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.
8:6 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made: 8:7 And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.
8:8 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground; 8:9 But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.
8:10 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark; 8:11 And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
8:12 And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.
4chan,
8:13 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
8:14 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.
8:15 And God spake unto Noah, saying, 8:16 Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.
8:17 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.
8:18 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him: 8:19 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.
8:20 And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
8:21 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.
8:22 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.
9:1 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.
9:2 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
9:3 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.
9:4 But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.
9:5 And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
9:6 Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.
9:7 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.
9:8 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, 9:9 And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you; 9:10 And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
9:11 And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
9:12 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: 9:13 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.
9:14 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: 9:15 And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
9:16 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
9:17 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.
9:18 And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.
9:19 These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.
9:20 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard: 9:21 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.
9:22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.
9:23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.
9:24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.
9:25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.
9:26 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.
9:27 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.
9:28 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
9:29 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.
10:1 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.
10:2 The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.
10:3 And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.
10:4 And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
10:5 By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.
10:6 And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.

hi
17:20 He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.
17:21 He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy.
17:22 A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones.
17:23 A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment.
17:24 Wisdom is before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth.
17:25 A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him.
17:26 Also to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for equity.
17:27 He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.
17:28 Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.
18:1 Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom.
18:2 A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.
18:3 When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach.
18:4 The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters, and the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook.
18:5 It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment.
18:6 A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes.
18:7 A fool's mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of his soul.
18:8 The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.
18:9 He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.
18:10 The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.
18:11 The rich man's wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit.
18:12 Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is humility.
18:13 He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him.
18:14 The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear? 18:15 The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.
18:16 A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.
18:17 He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.
18:18 The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty.
18:19 A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and their contentions are like the bars of a castle.
18:20 A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.
18:21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.
18:22 Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD.
18:23 The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.
18:24 A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.
19:1 Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool.
19:2 Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good; and he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.
19:3 The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the LORD.
19:4 Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour.
19:5 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall not escape.
19:6 Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts.
19:7 All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to him.
19:8 He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good.
19:9 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall perish.
19:10 Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes.
19:11 The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and it is his glory to pass over a transgression.
19:12 The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour is as dew upon the grass.
19:13 A foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.
19:14 House and riches are the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife is from the LORD.
19:15 Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.
19:16 He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; but he that despiseth his ways shall die.
19:17 He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again.
19:18 Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying.
19:19 A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver him, yet thou must do it again.
19:20 Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.
19:21 There are many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.
19:22 The desire of a man is his kindness: and a poor man is better than a liar.
19:23 The fear of the LORD tendeth to life: and he that hath it shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.
19:24 A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.
19:25 Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge.
19:26 He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.
19:27 Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge.
19:28 An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity.
19:29 Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools.
20:1 Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.
20:2 The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion: whoso provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul.
20:3 It is an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool will be meddling.
20:4 The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; therefore shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing.
20:5 Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out.
20:6 Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find? 20:7 The just man walketh in his integrity: his children are blessed after him.
20:8 A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes.
20:9 Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin? 20:10 Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them are alike abomination to the LORD.
20:11 Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure, and whether it be right.
20:12 The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them.
20:13 Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread.
20:14 It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.
20:15 There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.
20:16 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.
20:17 Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.
20:18 Every purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war.
20:19 He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets: therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.
20:20 Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.
20:21 An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed.
20:22 Say not thou, I will recompense evil; but wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee.
20:23 Divers weights are an abomination unto the LORD; and a false balance is not good.
20:24 Man's goings are of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own way? 20:25 It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy, and after vows to make enquiry.
20:26 A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them.
20:27 The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly.
20:28 Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy.
20:29 The glory of young men is their strength: and the beauty of old men is the grey head.
20:30 The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so do stripes the inward parts of the belly.
21:1 The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.
21:2 Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the LORD pondereth the hearts.
21:3 To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.
21:4 An high look, and a proud heart, and the plowing of the wicked, is sin.
21:5 The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; but of every one that is hasty only to want.
21:6 The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death.
21:7 The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment.
21:8 The way of man is froward and strange: but as for the pure, his work is right.
21:9 It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house.
21:10 The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes.
21:11 When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.
21:12 The righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked: but God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness.
21:13 Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.
21:14 A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom strong wrath.
21:15 It is joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity.
21:16 The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead.

That doesn't make any sense
Aristotle believed that all the matter in the universe was made up of four basic elements â earth, air, fire, and water .
\These elements were acted on by two forces: gravity, the tendency for earth and water to sink, and levity, the tendency
This division of the contents of the universe into matter and forces is still used today .  Aristotle
Democritus, held that matter was inherently grainy and that everything was made up of large numbers of various different kinds of atoms .

OK, right, letâs, first off, uhh youâre seventeen so youâre not even old enough to play the game, youâre from Scotland not Nigeria and you annoy people and put them on YouTube âcos youâre a cunt which I totally agree with. So why donât you crawl back up your mumâs fanny and die?
you're not supposed to be happy about this
Right, Iâll tell you what, you fat little cunt, youâre borinâ you donât sound Nigerian at all so go fuck yourselfâ¦ GO AND CRAWL IN A DIRTY DANK LITTLE HOLE WHERE YOU FUCKING COME FROM, YOU DIRTY DRAGON EATINâ LITTLE FUCKING SPASTIC.
Right, OK, the âdragonâ comment was probably a little bit fucking over-the-top, but at the end of the day youâre fucking borinâ. Every single person who watches your videos are fucking stupid. Theyâre fucking ignorant little cunts. And youâre just a fucking retard.
Yeah good implementation...

I sexually Identify as an Attack Helicopter. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of soaring over the oilfields dropping hot sticky loads on disgusting foreigners. People say to me that a person being a helicopter is Impossible and Iâm fucking retarded but I donât care, Iâm beautiful. Iâm having a plastic surgeon install rotary blades, 30 mm cannons and AMG-114 Hellfire missiles on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me
âApacheâ? and respect my right to kill from above and kill needlessly. If you canât accept me youâre a heliphobe and need to check your vehicle privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? Iâll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and Iâve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and Iâm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has
never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. Youâre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I
can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and thatâs just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little âcleverâ? comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe
you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldnât, you didnât, and now youâre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. Youâre fucking dead, kiddo.

Viperidae it's awesome how often his words make sense when you consider the fact that there is absolutely no natural language processing going on.

I have an idiot friend who doesn't understand what I mean by: "Lern how to program.", or "Learn how to write a computer program.", or "Learn the basics of Java before getting into modding"
As he has no idea what a method is
And he's writing a Minecraft mod...
